	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Correction to: Intra-arterial Stem Cell Therapy Diminishes Inflammasome Activation After Ischemic Stroke: a Possible Role of Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1a</title>

	<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has come to our notice that there was an inadvertent misupload of Fig. 2 (c, d) in the loading control (GAPDH) for ASIC1a and NLRP1 blots. We would like to replace the same with the correct image. This change anyhow does not affect the conclusion of the study. However, the use of GAPDH as a loading control for stroke studies sometimes is debatable (Zhai et al. 2014; Kang et al. 2018). Hence, we repeated our experiments to check the expression of ASIC1a and NLRP1 at different time points following stroke, using beta actin as a loading control. We found that at 24 h post stroke, maximal and significant expression of both ASIC1a and NLRP1 was observed (Fig. 2 e, f). The expression at 48 and 72 h post stroke were not significantly different as compared to that of sham. The expression results obtained using beta actin as a loading control were concurrent with the previous results published with GAPDH as a loading control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G9a is essential for dendritic plasticity and is associated with neurological disorders. The possible relationship between age-related hearing loss and G9a expression in the auditory cortex has not been fully explored. This study aimed to understand the expression patterns of G9a-mediated histone methylations in the auditory cortex during aging. Using immunofluorescence and western blotting, we demonstrated that a significant reduction in G9a expression observed in the auditory cortex of 24-month-old rats compared to 3-month-old rats, was associated with remarkable hearing threshold elevation and hair cell loss. Correspondingly, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and dimethylation (marked by H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, respectively), which were regulated by G9a activity, also evidently decreased during aging. These findings, which merit further investigation, suggest a possible association between G9a-mediated histone methylations and central age-related hearing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Genetic factors play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CDH13&lt;/em&gt; (rs6565113, rs11150556) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; (rs6551665, rs6858066, rs1947274, rs2345039) gene polymorphisms and ADHD. We also sought to examine possible relationships between these polymorphisms and the clinical course and treatment response in ADHD. A total of 120 patients (79% boys), aged 6 to 18 years, newly diagnosed (medication-naïve) with ADHD according to the DSM-5 and a group of 126 controls (74% girls) were enrolled in the study. We examined the association between the aforementioned polymorphisms and ADHD. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate factors influencing the treatment response of ADHD. A significant difference was found between ADHD and control groups in terms of genotype distribution of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms. The results also showed that having the GG genotype of rs6551665 and CC genotype of rs1947274 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; gene was associated with risk for ADHD, and this relationship was more prominent in male participants. In the multivariate logistic regression model established with variables shown to have a significant relationship with treatment response, the presence of the GG genotype of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 polymorphism and high severity of ADHD assessed by CGI-S were associated with poor response to treatment. This study is the first study to investigate the relationship between ADHD and these polymorphisms among Turkish adolescents. Our results imply that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms have a significant effect on ADHD in a Turkish population, and support previous observations that the presence of the GG genotype of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 polymorphism may be associated with poor response to treatment in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The pharmacological inhibition of glial activation is one of the new approaches for combating neuropathic pain in which the role of glia in the modulation of neuropathic pain has attracted significant interest and attention. Neuron-glial crosstalk is achieved with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-D-aspartate-2B receptor (NMDAR-2B) activation. This study aims to determine the effect of ifenprodil, a potent noncompetitive NMDAR-2B antagonist, on activated microglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) protein expression in the spinal cord of streptozotocin-induced painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) rats following formalin injection. In this experimentation, 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups: (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 12): control, PDN, and ifenprodil-treated PDN rats at 0.5 μg or 1.0 μg for 7 days. Type I diabetes mellitus was then induced by injecting streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.) into the rats which were then over a 2-week period allowed to progress into the early phase of PDN. Ifenprodil was administered in PDN rats while saline was administered intrathecally in the control group. A formalin test was conducted during the fourth week to induce inflammatory nerve injury, in which the rats were sacrificed at 72 h post-formalin injection. The lumbar enlargement region (L4–L5) of the spinal cord was dissected for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The results demonstrated a significant increase in formalin-induced flinching and licking behavior with an increased spinal expression of activated microglia, BDNF and DREAM proteins. It was also shown that the ifenprodil-treated rats following both doses reduced the extent of their flinching and duration of licking in PDN in a dose-dependent manner. As such, ifenprodil successfully demonstrated inhibition against microglia activation and suppressed the expression of BDNF and DREAM proteins in the spinal cord of PDN rats. In conclusion, ifenprodil may alleviate PDN by suppressing spinal microglia activation, BDNF and DREAM proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: NEAT1 Decreasing Suppresses Parkinson’s Disease Progression via Acting as miR-1301-3p Sponge</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01660-2</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in multiple disorders, while the role of it in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still unclear. Here, the increased lncRNA NEAT1 was discovered in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Then, we proved that NEAT1 decreasing suppressed MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neuronal apoptosis, upregulation of α-syn and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Rescue experiments shown that the inhibition of NEAT1 decreasing to MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent neuronal apoptosis can be reversed by overexpressed α-syn. Subsequently, we indicated the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-1301-3p, as well as between NEAT1 and miR-5047. Interesting, we found that NEAT1 decreasing repressed the expression of GJB1, a downstream target of miR-1301-3p and miR-5047, through promoting miR-1301-3p rather than miR-5047 expression. Finally, we transfected miR-1301-3p inhibitor to MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells following si-NEAT1, and found that downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-mediated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through regulating miR-1301-3p/GJB1 signaling pathway. Overall, our data demonstrated that NEAT1 decreasing effectively suppressed MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neuronal apoptosis. Mechanismly, downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via inhibiting the expression of GJB1 by targeting miR-1301-3p. Our study supported a new and reliable evidence for lncRNA NEAT1 as a potential target for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Integrated Systems Analysis Explores Dysfunctional Molecular Modules and Regulatory Factors in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder involving multiple genes that occurs in early childhood, and a number of risk genes have been reported in previous studies. However, the molecular mechanism of the polygenic regulation leading to pathological changes in ASD remains unclear. First, we identified 8 dysregulated gene coexpression modules by analyzing blood transcriptome data from 96 children with ASD and 42 controls. These modules are rich in ASD risk genes and function related to metabolism, immunity, neurodevelopment, and signaling. The regulatory factors of each module including microRNA (miRNA) and transcription factors (TFs) were subsequently predicted based on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. We identified a set of miRNAs that regulate metabolic and immune modules, as well as transcription factors that cause dysregulation of the modules, and we constructed a coregulatory network between the regulatory factors and modules. Our work reveals dysfunctional modules in children with ASD, elucidates the role of miRNA and transcription factor dysregulation in the pathophysiology of ASD, and helps us to further understand the underlying molecular mechanism of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Involvement of Oxidative Stress and Nerve Growth Factor in Behavioral and Biochemical Deficits of Experimentally Induced Musculoskeletal Pain in Mice: Ameliorative Effects of Heraclin</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Musculoskeletal pain is a widespread complex regional pain syndrome associated with altered emotional and cognitive functioning along with heightened physical disability that has become a global health concern. Effective management of this disorder and associated disabilities includes accurate diagnosis of its biomarkers and instituting mechanism–based therapeutic interventions. Herein, we explored the role of heraclin, a plant-derived molecule, in musculoskeletal pain and its underlying mechanistic approaches in an experimental mouse model. Reserpine (0.5 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days evoked hyperalgesia, motor incoordination, lack of exploratory behavior, anxiety, and cognition lapse in mice. Reserpine-challenged mice displayed higher serum cytokine level, altered brain neurotransmitter content, elevated brain and muscle oxidative stress, and upregulated brain nerve growth factor receptor expression. Treatment with heraclin (10 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) exerted analgesic effect and improved motor coordination and memory deficits in mice. Heraclin arrested serum cytokine rise, normalized brain neurotransmitter content, reduced tissue oxidative stress, and downregulated the nerve growth factor receptor expression. Therefore, it may be suggested that heraclin exerts beneficial effects against reserpine-induced musculoskeletal pain disorder possibly through the attenuation of NGFR-mediated pain and inflammatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To report the phenomenology of movement disorder (MD) in neurological Wilson disease (NWD), and correlate these with MRI, and biomarkers of oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Eighty-two patients were included, and their phenomenology of MD was categorized. The severity of dystonia was assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden score, and chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, and tremor on a 0–4 scale. The MRI changes were noted. Serum glutamate, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were measured. Movement disorders were noted in 78/82 (95.1%) patients and included dystonia in 69 (84.1%), chorea in 31 (37.8%), tremor in 24 (29.3%), parkinsonism in 19 (23.2%), athetosis in 13 (15.9%), and myoclonus in 9 (11.0%) patients. Dystonia was more frequently observed in the patients with thalamic (76.8 vs 23.2%), globus pallidus (72.0 vs 28.0%), putamen (69.5 vs 30.5%), caudate (68.3 vs 31.7%) and brainstem (61.0 vs 39.0%) involvement, and tremor with cerebellar involvement (37.5 vs 5.2%). The median age of onset of neurological symptoms was 12 (5–50) years. WD patients had higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate, and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα) and lower levels of glutathione and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared with the controls. Serum glutamate, IL-6, IL-8, and plasma MDA levels were increased with increasing neurological severity, while glutathione and TAC levels decreased. The severity of dystonia related to the number of MRI lesions. MD is the commonest neurological symptoms in WD. Oxidative stress, glutamate, and cytokine levels are increased in WD and correlate with neurological severity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Isolated dystonia is a common movement disorder often caused by genetic mutations, although it is predominantly sporadic in nature. Common variants of dystonia-related genes were reported to be risk factors for idiopathic isolated dystonia. In this study, we aimed to analyse the roles of previously reported GTP cyclohydrolase (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt;) and Torsin family 1 member A (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt;) polymorphisms in an Indian isolated dystonia case-control group. A total of 292 sporadic isolated dystonia patients and 316 control individuals were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt; (rs3759664:G &amp;gt; A, rs12147422:A &amp;gt; G and rs10483639:C &amp;gt; G) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt; (rs13300897:G &amp;gt; A, rs1801968:G &amp;gt; C, rs1182:G &amp;gt; T and rs3842225:G &amp;gt; Δ) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The statistical significance of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic associations of all of the SNPs were evaluated using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The minor allele (A) of rs3759664 is significantly associated with isolated limb dystonia as a risk factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005). The minor allele (C) of rs1801968 is strongly associated with isolated dystonia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and most of its subtypes. The major allele of rs3842225 (G) may act as a significant risk factor for Writer’s cramp (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03). Four different haplogroups comprising of either rs1182 or rs3842225 or in combination with rs1801968 and rs13300897 were found to be significantly associated with isolated dystonia. No other allelic, genotypic or haplotypic association was found to be significant with isolated dystonia cohort or its endophenotype stratified groups. Our study suggests that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt; common variants have a significant role in isolated dystonia pathogenesis in the Indian population, whereas SNPs in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt; gene may have a limited role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;By measuring the cerebral infarction rate and neurological behavioral score of rats in a sham operation group, an MCAO model control group and an &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection treatment group, we explored the therapeutic effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection on brain tissue and neuroethological injury in rats. Plasma samples were collected at 18 time points after intravenous injection of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt;. The levels of scutellarin, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid B in rat plasma at the various time points were determined by an HPLC method, and drug concentration versus time plots were constructed to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Finally, a PK-PD combined model was used to analyze the relationship between the blood concentration, time and therapeutic effects of the seven active components. The results of the pharmacodynamics studies showed that the cerebral infarction rate of rats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection group decreased significantly at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 6 h, 8 h, 18 h, 24 h, 32 h, 40 h and 48 h after cerebral ischemia. Abnormal neurological behavior scores were significantly reduced after 4 h of cerebral ischemia. The pharmacokinetics results showed that the seven chemical constituents in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection reached their highest detection value after 5 min of cerebral ischemia. The lowest detection values of scutellarin and isochlorogenic acid B appeared after 6 h of cerebral ischemia but could not be detected after 8 h. The lowest detection values of 5-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were found in the third hour of cerebral ischemia but not after 4 h. The lowest detection values of 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid were found during the second hour of cerebral ischemia but not at the third hour. However, at 18 h, 24 h, 32 h and 40 h of cerebral ischemia, the cerebral infarction rates of rats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection group were significantly reduced, with decreased values of 6.22%, 11.71%, 6.92% and 4.96%, respectively, and the effects were stronger than those after 5–20 min of cerebral ischemia. The decreased values reached their highest value after 24 h of cerebral ischemia. Our results show that the effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection on reducing the cerebral infarct rate in MCAO model rats are characterized by a fast onset and long maintenance time. The 5-min blood concentration in cerebral ischemia was the highest test value, and after this time, the cerebral infarction rate of MCAO rats began to decrease. However, the peak value of the effects lagged behind that of the plasma concentration. The maximum effective time for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection appeared 24 h after cerebral ischemia, which provides a reference for the screening of specific drugs for ischemic stroke, optimal dosing regimens and rational clinical drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to clarify the regulation role of miR-708 and miR-335-3p in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) autophagy and apoptosis in glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma mice were established by laser photocoagulation. RGCs were isolated and transfected with a series of plasmids and the cultured in 60 mmHg pressure. miR-335-3p, miR-708, and ATG3 mRNA expressions were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of ATG3, autophagy-related protein LC3, and p62 were detected by Western blot. The apoptosis of RGCs was detected by flow cytometry. The regulation role of miR-335-3p/miR-708 in ATG3 was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter gene. The expressions of several miRNAs were measured in retinal tissues from chronic glaucoma mice and RGCs under pressure conditions, and results showed that both miR-335-3p and miR-708 were down-regulated. Besides, the inhibition of miR-708 and miR-335-3p induced the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy. Also, miR-708 and miR-335-3p could bind to ATG3 and targeted regulated ATG3. Furthermore, the interference with miR-708/miR-335-3p induced RGC apoptosis by up-regulating ATG3 to promote autophagy. In general, the down-regulation of miR-708 and miR-335-3p contributed to the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy in glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNP rs2043211 in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CARD8&lt;/em&gt; was found to have significant association with ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the possible association between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese and explain the possible mechanism. In total, 716 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and 1088 controls were included in the study. Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke risk by odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Stratified and interaction analyses were also done. We selected another 111 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and measured the CARD8 levels in their plasma samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants who carry T/T genotype have a higher risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared with those carry A/T or A/A genotypes (odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence intervals 1.03–1.77, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.029). The higher risk for the T/T genotype is still notable in female, people with hypertension, and people without diabetes. In the interaction analysis, compared to the non-hypertensive participants with the wild homozygote type A/A, the hypertensive participants with the A/T+T/T homozygote had 3.27-fold increased risk (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence intervals 2.33–4.60). The A/A group had lower CARD8 levels in plasma than the A/T and T/T group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Further bioinformatics prediction indicated that the rs2043211 could significantly influence the mRNA secondary structure and protein expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CARD8&lt;/em&gt; (eQTL &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 9.8 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−198&lt;/sup&gt;). The rs2043211 is probably a novel biomarker for large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Drinking Pattern in Intermittent Access Two-Bottle-Choice Paradigm in Male Wistar Rats Is Associated with Exon-Specific BDNF Expression in the Hippocampus During Early Abstinence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01645-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Outbred rats differentially consume alcohol when having free access to it. Among others, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is believed to control voluntary ethanol intake in rodents. Meanwhile, expression of BDNF exons in brain regions and epigenetic mechanisms underlying alcohol intake pattern remain obscure. The main goal was to study whether voluntary alcohol drinking pattern affects expression of BDNF exons in selected rat brain regions during early abstinence. Intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a two-bottle-choice procedure (IA2BC) was used as a model of voluntary ethanol intake. Male Wistar rats (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 24) had twenty 24-h sessions of free access to two-bottle choice (water or 20% ethanol) with 24-h withdrawal periods (water only). Control animals had access to water only (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11). After finishing IA2BC, the animals were divided according to the compliance of ethanol intake pattern with gradual escalation, a key feature of the paradigm. To access potential behavioral disturbances during the early abstinence, rats were consequently tested in the open field test, the elevated plus-maze, and the sucrose preference test. On the third day after the last drinking session, expression of BDNF exons and polypeptide was measured in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and midbrain using quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to analyze enrichment of positive Ph-CREB (Ser133) and negative EZH2 transcriptional regulators as well as markers of active H3K9ac and repressed H3K27me3 chromatin at exon-specific BDNF promoters in brain regions with affected BDNF expression. During the course of the IA2BC, one part of animals demonstrated gradual escalation from low to high alcohol intake and preference of alcohol over water (a typical pattern for IA2BC) while the other one consumed alcohol at a consistently high level (an unusual pattern for IA2BC). Drinking pattern in the IA2BC does not define differences of behavior in any of the tests during early abstinence. Finally, the IA2BC rats with growing alcohol intake showed elevation of BDNF mRNA containing exon VI in the hippocampus associated with an enhanced H3K9ac occupancy at the respective promoter. Thus, rats differentially consuming alcohol in the IA2BC paradigm differ in epigenetically determined expression of BDNF exon VI in the hippocampus during early abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Influence of Two Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene ( OXTR ) on Empathy: the Mediation Role of a Primary Emotion, CARE</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To feel other’s pain would elicit empathy. Some theorists hypothesized that observing other’s pain may activate the primary emotion of maternal care instinct, which may function as a precursor of empathy. The maternal care instinct and empathy share the same genetic background and neuroendocrine underpinnings. An extensive body of research has shown that maternal behaviors relate to the oxytocinergic system, which has a strong influence on empathy. These studies suggest that the maternal care instinct may mediate the effect of oxytocin receptor gene (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt;) on empathy. To provide evidence for this mediation, we used the subscale of CARE in Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) to measure the maternal care instinct and tested two &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt; single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs53576 and rs13316193, in 880 high school participants (588 females, 292 males; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 16.51 years old, SD = 0.65). Results showed that the genotype of rs13316193 was indirectly associated with empathy via CARE, suggesting a mediating role of CARE in the pathway from &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt; to empathy. These findings may contribute to an understanding of how empathy emerges when one witnesses another person in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy(MLD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by the mutations in arylsulfatase A gene (ARSA), which results in the deficiency of ARSA enzyme. The common clinical characteristics of MLD are abnormal gait, and then gradually appears ataxia, spastic quadriplegia, optic atrophy, cortical blindness, and dementia. We describe two patients in China who were diagnosed with MLD and find that the four ARSA gene mutations (c.1115G&amp;gt;A, c.302G&amp;gt;T, c.893 G&amp;gt; T, and c.302G&amp;gt;T) are associated with MLD, in which c.893 G&amp;gt;T and c.302G&amp;gt;T are novel mutations by gene sequence and clinical manifestations, to further understand the relationship between MLD and ARSA gene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The sweet taste receptor, which was identified approximately 20 years ago, mediates sweet taste recognition in humans and other vertebrates. With the development of genomics, metabonomics, structural biology, evolutionary biology, physiology, and neuroscience, as well as technical advances in these areas, our understanding of this important protein has resulted in substantial progress. This article reviews the structure, function, genetics, and evolution of the sweet taste receptor and offers meaningful insights into this G protein–coupled receptor, which may be helpful guidances for personalized feeding, diet, and medicine. Prospective directions for research on sweet taste receptors have also been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Correlation Between SNPs at the 3'UTR of the FGF2 Gene and Their Interaction with Environmental Factors in Han Chinese Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2 is a neurotrophic factor that can act as a key regulatory molecule of neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis in various injuries. To explore the genetic background of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene on DPN development, this study analyzed the correlation between SNPs in the 3'UTR of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene and their interaction with environmental factors in DPN patients of Han Chinese nationality. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; genotypes at the rs1048201, rs3804158, rs41348645, rs6854081, rs3747676, rs7683093, rs1476215, and rs1476217 loci in 150 DPN patients, 150 NDPN patients, and 150 healthy control patients. Plasma FGF2 levels were measured in all subjects by using ELISAs. Subjects carrying the T allele at the rs1048201 locus in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene had a significantly lower risk of developing DPN compared with subjects carrying the C allele (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33–0.56, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Subjects with the G genotype at the rs6854081 locus had an exceptionally higher risk of developing DPN than subjects with the T allele (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.39–1.89, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Individuals harboring the G allele at the rs7683093 locus had a markedly higher risk of DPN than patients with the C allele (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.36–1.87, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Finally, individuals having the A genotype at the rs1476215 locus had a significantly higher risk of DPN than individuals carrying the T allele (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.53–2.02, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). There was an interaction between age and alcohol consumption and the SNP rs7683093. SNPs at rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; 3’UTR were strongly associated with plasma levels of FGF2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). SNPs at the rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 loci in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene were significantly associated with the risk of DPN. A possible mechanism is that these SNPs affect the expression level of FGF2 by interrupting the binding of microRNAs to target sites in the 3'UTR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture. Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt;) is known as the nuclear factor of activated T cells and regulates cell growth. This study was aimed to explore the effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; on IA progression. Human brain VSMCs (hBVSMCs) were transfected with pCDNA3.1(+), pCDNA3.1(+)-ILF2, siRNA-negative control, and siRNA-ILF2. The transfection efficiency was then evaluated by determining &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; expression. The cell viability and apoptosis were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin V-FITC cell apoptosis assay kit, respectively. Real-time quantification PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related and inflammation-related genes. Finally, western blot was used to detect the expression level of Fas cell surface death receptor 95 (CD95) and Caspase 8. Overexpression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; could significantly increase cell viability and decrease cell apoptosis (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while knock-down of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; showed opposite trends for hBVSMCs on cell viability and apoptosis (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). RT-qPCR results showed that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down downregulated the expression levels of BCL2 apoptosis regulator (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BCL2&lt;/em&gt;), transcriptional regulator Myc-like (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c-Myc&lt;/em&gt;), and caspase 1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/em&gt;) whereas upregulated the expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CD95&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p53&lt;/em&gt;, and interleukin-13 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-13&lt;/em&gt;). Additionally, the protein expression levels of CD95 and Caspase 8 were significantly decreased after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; overexpression while were significantly increased after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down may inhibit cell viability and promote cell apoptosis of hBVSMCs by regulating the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes and suppressing inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is known as a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder typified by an immune-mediated demyelination process with ensuing axonal damage and loss. Sinomenine is a natural alkaloid with different therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, possible beneficial effects of sinomenine in an MOG-induced model of MS were determined. Sinomenine was given to MOG&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;35–55&lt;/sub&gt;-immunized C57BL/6 mice at doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg/day after onset of MS clinical signs till day 30 post-immunization. Analyzed data showed that sinomenine reduces severity of the clinical signs and to some extent decreases tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNFα, IL-17A, and increases level of anti-inflammatory IL-10. In addition, sinomenine successfully attenuated tissue levels of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1 besides its reduction of intensity of neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage and loss in lumbar spinal cord specimens. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for MBP decreased and increased for GFAP and Iba1 after MOG-immunization, which was in part reversed upon sinomenine administration. Overall, sinomenine decreases EAE severity, which is attributed to its alleviation of microglial and astrocytic mobilization, demyelination, and axonal damage along with its suppression of neuroinflammation, and its beneficial effect is also associated with its inhibitory effects on inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways; this may be of potential benefit for the primary progressive phenotype of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Intra-arterial Stem Cell Therapy Diminishes Inflammasome Activation After Ischemic Stroke: a Possible Role of Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1a</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Studies from our lab demonstrated that 1 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; intra-arterial mesenchymal stem cells (IA MSCs) at 6 h following ischemic stroke are efficacious owing to its maximum homing due to elevated stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1) in the tissue. Further, IA MSCs could abate the infarct progression, improve functional outcome, and decrease expression of calcineurin by modifying neuronal Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels following ischemic stroke. Since stroke pathology also encompasses acidosis that worsens the condition; hence, the role of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in this context could not be overlooked. ASIC1a being the major contributor towards acidosis triggers Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions overload which progressively contributes towards exacerbation of neuronal injury following ischemic insult. Inflammasome involvement in ischemic stroke is well reported as activated ASIC1a increases the expression of inflammasome in a pH-dependent manner to trigger inflammatory cascade. Hence, the current study aimed to identify if IA MSCs can decrease the production of inflammasome by attenuating ASIC1a expression to render neuroprotection. Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 1 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MSCs IA at 6 h to check for the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasome in different groups. Inhibition studies were carried out to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that IA MSCs improves functional outcome and oxidative stress parameters, and decreases the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasomes in the cortical brain region after ischemic stroke. This study offers a preliminary evidence of the role of IA MSCs in regulating inflammasome by modulating ASIC1a.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Replicability, Repeatability, and Long-term Reproducibility of Cerebellar Morphometry</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To identify robust and reproducible methods of cerebellar morphometry that can be used in future large-scale structural MRI studies, we investigated the replicability, repeatability, and long-term reproducibility of three fully automated software tools: FreeSurfer, CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES), and automatic cerebellum anatomical parcellation using U-Net with locally constrained optimization (ACAPULCO). Replicability was defined as computational replicability, determined by comparing two analyses of the same high-resolution MRI data set performed with identical analysis software and computer hardware. Repeatability was determined by comparing the analyses of two MRI scans of the same participant taken during two independent MRI sessions on the same day for the Kirby-21 study. Long-term reproducibility was assessed by analyzing two MRI scans of the same participant in the longitudinal OASIS-2 study. We determined percent difference, the image intraclass correlation coefficient, the coefficient of variation, and the intraclass correlation coefficient between two analyses. Our results show that CERES and ACAPULCO use stochastic algorithms that result in surprisingly high differences between identical analyses for ACAPULCO and small differences for CERES. Changes between two consecutive scans from the Kirby-21 study were less than ± 5% in most cases for FreeSurfer and CERES (i.e., demonstrating high repeatability). As expected, long-term reproducibility was lower than repeatability for all software tools. In summary, CERES is an accurate, as demonstrated before, and reproducible tool for fully automated segmentation and parcellation of the cerebellum. We conclude with recommendations for the assessment of replicability, repeatability, and long-term reproducibility in future studies on cerebellar structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: STEP inhibition prevents Aβ-mediated damage in dendritic complexity and spine density in Alzheimer’s disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Loss of dendritic spines and decline of cognitive function are hallmarks of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that AD pathophysiology involves increased expression of a central nervous system-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase called STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase). STEP opposes the development of synaptic strengthening by dephosphorylating substrates, including GluN2B, Pyk2, and ERK1/2. Genetic reduction of STEP as well as pharmacological inhibition of STEP improve cognitive function and hippocampal memory in the 3×Tg-AD mouse model. Here, we show that the improved cognitive function is accompanied by an increase in synaptic connectivity in cell cultures as well as in the triple transgenic AD mouse model, further highlighting the potential of STEP inhibitors as a therapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cortical Mechanisms of Saccadic Suppression</title>

	<description>Saccades are a ubiquitous and crucial component of our visual system, allowing for the efficient deployment of the fovea and its accompanying neural resources. Initiation of a saccade is known to cause saccadic suppression, a temporary reduction in visual sensitivity and visual cortical firing rates. While saccadic suppression has been well characterized at the level of perception and single neurons, relatively little is known about the visual cortical networks governing this phenomenon. Here we examine the effects of saccadic suppression on distinct neural subpopulations within area V4. We find cortical layer- and cell type-specific differences in the magnitude and timing of peri-saccadic modulation. Neurons in the input layer show changes in firing rate and inter-neuronal correlations prior to saccade onset, suggesting that this layer receives information about impending saccades. Putative inhibitory interneurons in the input layer elevate their firing rate during saccades and may play a role in suppressing the activity of other cortical subpopulations. A computational model of this circuit recapitulates our empirical observations and demonstrates that an input layer-targeting pathway could initiate saccadic suppression by enhancing local inhibitory activity. Together, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how eye movement signaling interacts with cortical circuitry to enforce visual stability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Double stranded RNA drives innate immune responses, sickness behavior and cognitive impairment dependent on dsRNA length, IFNAR1 expression and age</title>

	<description>Double stranded RNA is generated during viral replication. The synthetic analog poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease including autism, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1 to 6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF alpha responses than poly I:C of less than 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN beta nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN beta binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1beta and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length, IFNAR1 and age-dependent effects on antiviral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Long-lasting reduction of intrinsic excitability in O-LM interneurons is mediated by endocannabinoid-dependent up-regulation of Kv7 channels</title>

	<description>KCNQ-Kv7 channels are found at the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons where they control cell firing and membrane potential. In oriens lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, these channels are mainly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a peculiar function of Kv7 channels in these neurons. The physiology of Kv7 channels is well characterized today but the precise contribution of these channels to neuronal plasticity is still unknown. Here, we show that Kv7 channel activity is up-regulated following induction of presynaptic long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in O-LM interneurons, thus resulting in a synergistic long-term depression of intrinsic neuronal excitability (LTD-IE). Both LTD and LTD-IE involve endocannabinoid (eCB) biosynthesis for their induction. Molecular modeling shows strong interaction of eCBs with Kv7.2/3 channel, suggesting a persistent action of these lipids on Kv7 channel activity. Our data thus unveil a major role for eCB synthesis in triggering both synaptic and intrinsic depression in O-LM interneurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: In vivo CGG repeat RNA binding protein capture identifies RAN translation modifiers and suppressors of repeat toxicity.</title>

	<description>Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a transcribed CGG repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. Expanded CGG repeat RNAs both sequester RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) into nuclear foci and undergo repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation into toxic homopolymeric peptides. RBPs that interact with CGG repeats may play a pivotal role in foci formation and/or RAN translation. Here we employed a CGG repeat RNA-tagging system to capture and identify CGG repeat binding RBPs in vivo under different cellular conditions. We found that several SR (serine/arginine-rich domain) proteins interact with CGG repeat RNAs basally and under cellular stress. These same proteins strongly modify toxicity in a Drosophila model of FXTAS, improving eye degeneration and survival. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological targeting of the serine/arginine protein kinases (SRPKs) suppresses RAN translation in cellular reporters and toxicity in fly models of FXTAS and C9orf72 ALS/FTD. Finally, pharmacological targeting of SRPK1 supressed CGG repeat toxicity and enhanced survival in rodent neurons. Taken together, these findings demonstrate roles for CGG repeat RNA binding proteins in both RAN translation and repeat toxicity and suggest SRPK inhibition may serve as a possible therapeutic strategy in repeat expansion disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Variance misperception under skewed empirical noise statistics explains overconfidence in the visual periphery</title>

	<description>Perceptual confidence typically corresponds to accuracy. However, observers can be overconfident relative to accuracy, termed 'subjective inflation'. Inflation is stronger in the visual periphery relative to central vision, especially under conditions of peripheral inattention. Previous literature suggests inflation stems from errors in estimating noise, i.e. 'variance misperception'. However, despite previous Bayesian hypotheses about metacognitive noise estimation, no work has systematically explored how noise estimation may critically depend on empirical noise statistics which may differ across the visual field, with central noise distributed symmetrically but peripheral noise positively skewed. Here we examined central and peripheral vision predictions from five Bayesian-inspired noise-estimation algorithms under varying usage of noise priors, including effects of attention. Models that failed to optimally estimate noise exhibited peripheral inflation, but only models that explicitly used peripheral noise priors incorrectly showed increasing peripheral inflation under increasing peripheral inattention. Our findings explain peripheral inflation, especially under inattention.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Effects of Ih and TASK-like shunting current on dendritic impedance in layer 5 pyramidal-tract neurons</title>

	<description>Pyramidal neurons in neocortex have complex input-output relationships that depend on their morphologies, ion channel distributions, and the nature of their inputs, but which cannot be replicated by simple integrate-and-fire models. The impedance properties of their dendritic arbors, such as resonance and phase shift, shape neuronal responses to synaptic inputs and provide intraneuronal functional maps reflecting their intrinsic dynamics and excitability. Experimental studies of dendritic impedance have shown that neocortical pyramidal tract neurons exhibit distance-dependent changes in resonance and impedance phase with respect to the soma. We therefore investigated how well several biophysically-detailed multi-compartment models of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons reproduce the location-dependent impedance profiles observed experimentally. Each model tested here exhibited location-dependent impedance profiles, but most captured either the observed impedance amplitude or phase, not both. The only model that captured features from both incorporates HCN channels and a shunting current, like that produced by Twik-related acid-sensitive K+ (TASK) channels. TASK-like channel activity in this model was dependent on local peak HCN channel conductance (Ih). We found that while this shunting current alone is insufficient to produce resonance or realistic phase response, it modulates all features of dendritic impedance, including resonance frequencies, resonance strength, synchronous frequencies, and total inductive phase. We also explored how the interaction of Ih and a TASK-like shunting current shape synaptic potentials and produce degeneracy in dendritic impedance profiles, wherein different combinations of Ih and shunting current can produce the same impedance profile.</description>

	<description>Innovations in high-resolution optical imaging have allowed visualization of nanoscale biological structures and connections. However, super-resolution fluorescence techniques, including both optics-oriented and sample-expansion based, are limited in quantification and throughput especially in tissues from photobleaching or quenching of the fluorophores, and low-efficiency or non-uniform delivery of the probes. Here, we report a general sample-expansion vibrational imaging strategy, termed VISTA, for scalable label-free high-resolution interrogations of protein-rich biological structures with resolution down to 82 nm. VISTA achieves decent three-dimensional image quality through optimal retention of endogenous proteins, isotropic sample expansion, and deprivation of scattering lipids. Free from probe-labeling associated issues, VISTA offers unbiased and high-throughput tissue investigations. With correlative VISTA and immunofluorescence, we further validated the imaging specificity of VISTA and trained an image-segmentation model for label-free multi-component and volumetric prediction of nucleus, blood vessels, neuronal cells and dendrites in complex mouse brain tissues. VISTA could hence open new avenues for versatile biomedical studies.</description>

	<description>Haploinsufficiency of progranulin (PGRN) is a leading cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). PGRN is comprised of 7.5 granulin repeats and the precursor is processed into individual granulin peptides by lysosome proteases. The granulin peptides are also haplo-insufficient in FTLD and proposed to possess unique functions. However, very little is known about the levels and regulations of each granulin peptide in the lysosome due to the lack of reagents to specifically detect each individual granulin peptide. Here we report the generation and characterization of antibodies specific to each granulin peptide. We found that the levels of granulins C, E and F are lower than granulins A and B under certain conditions, indicating differences in the stability of individual granulin peptides within the lysosome once liberated from PGRN. Furthermore, we demonstrated that granulin B, C and E are heavily glycosylated and the glycosylation pattern of granulin C varies in different physiological and pathological conditions. The ratio between granulins and PGRN is highest in the cortex region in the male mouse brain. Loss of lysosomal protease cathepsin B leads to an increase in the levels of granulins A and B without affecting the levels of granulins C and F in the cortex. Deletion of cathepsin D results in a decrease in the ratio between granulin A, B and C, but not granulin F and full length PGRN. These data support that the levels of individual granulin peptides are differentially regulated under physiological and pathological conditions and provide novel insights into how PGRN functions in the lysosome.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Decoupling of global brain activity and cerebrospinal fluid flow in Parkinson's cognitive decline</title>

	<description>Background: Deposition and spreading of misfolded proteins (-synuclein and tau) have been linked to Parkinson's cognitive dysfunction. The glymphatic system may play an important role in the clearance of these toxic proteins via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through perivascular and interstitial spaces. Recent studies discovered that sleep-dependent global brain activity is coupled to CSF flow that may reflect glymphatic function. Objective: To determine if the decoupling of brain activity-CSF flow is linked to Parkinson's cognitive dysfunction. Methods: Functional and structural MRI data, clinical motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), and cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) scores were collected from 60 Parkinson's and 58 control subjects. Parkinson's patients were subgrouped into those with (MoCA &amp;lt; 26; N = 29) and without (MoCA [≥] 26; N = 31) mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The coupling strength between the resting-state global blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal (gBOLD) and associated CSF flow was quantified, compared among groups, and associated with clinical and structural measurements. Results: gBOLD-CSF coupling decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.006) in Parkinson's patients showing MCI, compared to those without MCI and controls. Reduced gBOLD-CSF coupling was associated with decreased MoCA scores that was present in Parkinson's patients (p = 0.005) but not in controls (p = 0.65). Weaker gBOLD-CSF coupling in Parkinson's patients also was associated with a thinner right entorhinal cortex (Spearman's correlation = - 0.36; p = 0.012), an early structural change often seen in Alzheimer's. Conclusions: The decoupling between global brain activity and associated CSF flow is related to Parkinson's cognitive impairment.</description>

	<description>Higher order feedback projections to sensory cortical areas converge on layer 1 (L1), the primary site for integration of top-down information via the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and L1 GABAergic interneurons. Here, we investigated the contribution of early thalamic inputs onto L1 interneurons for the establishment of top-down inputs in the primary visual cortex. We find that bottom-up thalamic inputs predominate during early L1 development and preferentially target neurogliaform cells. We find that these projections are critical for the subsequent strengthening of feedback inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex. Enucleation or selective removal of thalamic afferents blocked this phenomenon. Notably, while early activation of anterior cingulate afferents resulted in a premature strengthening of these top-down inputs to neurogliaform cells, this was also dependent on thalamic inputs. Our results demonstrate that the proper establishment of top-down feedback inputs critically depends on bottom-up inputs from the thalamus during early postnatal development.</description>

	<description>Background: Malnutrition is characterized by impaired nutrient ingestion and absorption, and it is still one of the most substantial causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating eye tracking in children with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). We sought to investigate how PEM may affect eye movement. Methods: Twenty children without PEM (mean age = 10.8; SD = 1.0 years) and 18 children with PEM (mean age = 10.9; SD = 1.2 years). Here we used three types of tests or stimuli: one formed by a maze and two by seven errors games (boats and elephants). Results: Our results indicated that children with PEM had impaired performance on all of the tests used here. These data suggest that the nutritional impairments during the first year of life, the critical period in visual system development, can have direct impact on eye movement patterns. Conclusions: Our findings must be replicated so that neurophysiological patterns of PEM can be precisely understood. However, this study has repercussions in several areas of knowledge.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A Novel Approach to Study Gamma-Band Coherence in Ex Vivo Hippocampal Slices from a Mouse Model of Bipolar Disorder.</title>

	<description>Oscillations play crucial roles in many cognitive processes such as memory formation and attention. GABAergic interneurons can synchronize neuronal activity leading to gamma oscillations (30-60 Hz). Abnormalities in oscillatory activity in the hippocampus have been implicated in the pathology of some mental health disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, however the neurobiological mechanism underlying these abnormal oscillations are not yet fully understood. We set out to develop a reliable approach to study gamma oscillations in ex vivo hippocampal preparations using perforated microelectrode arrays. Perforated microelectrode arrays allow for the simultaneous measurement of electrical activity at multiple sites while allowing solutions to pass through the brain section. We obtained extracellular electrophysiological recordings from acute sections of mouse hippocampus situated on a 60-channel, perforated microelectrode arrays (pMEAs). Bath application of kainate rapidly induced and maintained oscillatory activity in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Kainate-induced oscillations were quickly abolished by the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Furthermore, we employed this approach on a mouse model of bipolar disorder. Sections prepared from mutant mice exhibited an increase in the coherence of gamma power within CA1 despite a reduction in gamma-band power.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Coherent Default Mode Network is not involved in Episodic Recall or Social Cognition</title>

	<description>Resting-state network research is extremely influential, yet the functions of many networks remain unknown. Hypotheses implicating the default mode network (DMN) in episodic memory and social cognition are highly popular. Univariate analyses and meta-analyses of these functions show activation in similar regions to the DMN. However, this does not necessitate the involvement of the coherent network in these functions. Here we formally test the role of the coherent DMN in episodic and social processing. As well as an episodic retrieval task, two independent datasets were employed to assess the breadth of social cognition; a person knowledge judgement and a theory of mind task. Independent component analysis separated each task dataset into coherent networks. For each, the core DMN was identified through comparison to an a priori template and its relation to the task model was assessed. The DMN did not show greater activity in episodic or social tasks than in high-level baseline conditions. Thus, no evidence was found for the involvement of the coherent DMN in explicit episodic or social processing tasks. The networks responsible for these processes are described and the univariate findings considered in light of these findings. Implications for the functional significance of the DMN are considered.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Caspase inhibition mitigates tau cleavage and neurotoxicity in iPSC-induced neurons with the V337M MAPT mutation</title>

	<description>Tau post-translational modifications (PTMs) are associated with progressive tau accumulation and neuronal loss in tauopathies, including forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Proteolytic cleavage of tau by active caspases, including caspase-6, represents an underexplored tau PTM implicated in tau pathology. Caspase-cleaved tau is toxic and prone to self-aggregation in experimental models. To elucidate the presence and temporal course of caspase activation, tau cleavage, and neuronal death, we generated two neoepitope monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against caspase-6 tau proteolytic sites and cortical neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-causing V337M MAPT mutation. FTLD V337M MAPT and AD postmortem brains showed positivity for both cleaved tau mAbs as well as active caspase-6. Relative to isogenic wild-type MAPT controls, V337M MAPT neurons showed a time-dependent increase in pathogenic tau in the form of tau oligomers, caspase-cleaved tau, and p-tau. Accumulation of toxic tau species in 3-month V337M MAPT neurons also increased vulnerability to stress, which was pharmacologically rescued by caspase inhibition. We propose a model in which time-dependent accumulation of caspase-cleaved tau in V337M MAPT neurons promotes neurotoxicity that is reversed by caspase-6 inhibition. Caspase-cleaved tau may be a biomarker of tauopathy, and caspases could be viable targets for therapeutic intervention against tau pathogenesis in FTLD and other tauopathies.</description>

	<description>Choosing how much effort to expend is a critical for everyday decisions. While effort-based decision-making is altered in common psychopathologies and many neuroimaging studies have been conducted to examine how effort is valued, it remains unclear where the brain processes effort-related costs and integrates them with rewards. Using meta-analyses of combined maps and coordinates of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (total N = 22), we showed that raw effort demands consistently activated the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). In contrast, the net value of effortful reward consistently activated regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum (VS), that have been previously implicated in value integration in other cost domains. The opposite activation patterns of the pre-SMA and vmPFC imply a double dissociation of these two regions, in which the pre-SMA is involved in pure effort cost representation and the vmPFC in net value integration. These findings advance our understanding of the neural basis of effort-related valuation and reveal potential brain targets to treat motivation-related disorders.</description>

	<description>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by SOD1 gene mutations, both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms lead to the selective degeneration of motoneurons. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of gene therapy targeting mutated SOD1 in mature astrocytes using mice expressing the mutated SOD1G93A protein. An AAV-gfaABC1D vector encoding an artificial microRNA is used to deliver RNA interference against mutated SOD1 selectively in astrocytes. The treatment leads to the progressive rescue of neuromuscular junction occupancy, to the recovery of the compound muscle action potential in the gastrocnemius muscle, and significantly improves neuromuscular function. In the spinal cord, gene therapy targeting astrocytes protects a small pool of fast-fatigable motoneurons until disease end stage. In the gastrocnemius muscle of the treated SOD1G93A mice, the fast-twitch type IIb muscle fibers are preserved from atrophy. Axon collateral sprouting is observed together with muscle fiber type grouping indicative of denervation/re-innervation events. The transcriptome profiling of spinal cord motoneurons shows changes in the expression levels of factors regulating the dynamics of microtubules. Gene therapy delivering RNA interference against mutated SOD1 in astrocytes provides therapeutic effects enhancing motoneuron plasticity and improving neuromuscular function in ALS mice.</description>

	<description>Synaptic transmission, connectivity, and dendritic morphology mature in parallel during brain development and are often disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet how these changes influence the neuronal computations necessary for normal brain function are not well understood. To identify cellular mechanisms underlying the maturation of synaptic integration in interneurons, we combined patch-clamp recordings of excitatory inputs in cerebellar stellate cells (SCs), 3D-reconstruction of SC morphology with excitatory synapse location, and biophysical modeling. We found that, during development, synaptic strength was homogeneously reduced along the somato-dendritic axis, but that dendritic integration was always sublinear. However, dendritic branching increased without changes in synapse density, leading to a substantial gain in distal inputs. Thus, changes in synapse distribution, rather than dendrite cable properties, are the dominant mechanism underlying the maturation of neuronal computation. These mechanisms favor the emergence of a spatially compartmentalized two-stage integration model promoting location-dependent integration within dendritic subunits.</description>

Restoring gene function by the induced skipping of deleterious exons has been shown to be effective for treating genetic disorders. However, many of the clinically successful therapies for exon skipping are transient oligonucleotide-based treatments that require frequent dosing. CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing that causes exon skipping is a promising therapeutic modality that may offer permanent alleviation of genetic disease. We show that machine learning can select Cas9 guide RNAs that disrupt splice acceptors and cause the skipping of targeted exons. We experimentally measured the exon skipping frequencies of a diverse genome-integrated library of 791 splice sequences targeted by 1,063 guide RNAs in mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that our method, SkipGuide, is able to identify effective guide RNAs with a precision of 0.68 (50% threshold predicted exon skipping frequency) and 0.93 (70% threshold predicted exon skipping frequency). We anticipate that SkipGuide will be useful for selecting guide RNA candidates for evaluation of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated exon skipping therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j1kY3vkHmjg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nucleosome positioning is crucial for the genome’s function. Though the role of DNA sequence in positioning nucleosomes is well understood, a detailed mechanistic understanding on the impact of transcription remains lacking. Using numerical simulations, we investigated the dependence of nucleosome density profiles on transcription level across multiple species. We found that the low nucleosome affinity of yeast, but not mouse, promoters contributes to the formation of phased nucleosomes arrays for inactive genes. For the active genes, a heterogeneous distribution of +1 nucleosomes, caused by a tug-of-war between two types of remodeling enzymes, is essential for reproducing their density profiles. In particular, while positioning enzymes are known to remodel the +1 nucleosome and align it toward the transcription start site (TSS), spacer enzymes that use a pair of nucleosomes as their substrate can shift the nucleosome array away from the TSS. Competition between these enzymes results in two types of nucleosome density profiles with well- and ill-positioned +1 nucleosome. Finally, we showed that Pol II assisted histone exchange, if occurring at a fast speed, can abolish the impact of remodeling enzymes. By elucidating the role of individual factors, our study reconciles the seemingly conflicting results on the overall impact of transcription in positioning nucleosomes across species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5RKmZq8JDaA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dissecting the links between reward and loss, decision-making, and self-reported affect using a computational approach</title>

Links between affective states and risk-taking are often characterised using summary statistics from serial decision-making tasks. However, our understanding of these links, and the utility of decision-making as a marker of affect, needs to accommodate the fact that ongoing (e.g., within-task) experience of rewarding and punishing decision outcomes may alter future decisions and affective states. To date, the interplay between affect, ongoing reward and punisher experience, and decision-making has received little detailed investigation. Here, we examined the relationships between reward and loss experience, affect, and decision-making in humans using a novel judgement bias task analysed with a novel computational model. We demonstrated the influence of within-task favourability on decision-making, with more risk-averse/‘pessimistic’ decisions following more positive previous outcomes and a greater current average earning rate. Additionally, individuals reporting more negative affect tended to exhibit greater risk-seeking decision-making, and, based on our model, estimated time more poorly. We also found that individuals reported more positive affective valence during periods of the task when prediction errors and offered decision outcomes were more positive. Our results thus provide new evidence that (short-term) within-task rewarding and punishing experiences determine both future decision-making and subjectively experienced affective states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OAYy0Bjv2Kw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The complexity of protein interactions unravelled from structural disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008546</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Seoane, Alessandra Carbone&lt;/p&gt;

The importance of unstructured biology has quickly grown during the last decades accompanying the explosion of the number of experimentally resolved protein structures. The idea that structural disorder might be a novel mechanism of protein interaction is widespread in the literature, although the number of statistically significant structural studies supporting this idea is surprisingly low. At variance with previous works, our conclusions rely exclusively on a large-scale analysis of all the 134337 X-ray crystallographic structures of the Protein Data Bank averaged over clusters of almost identical protein sequences. In this work, we explore the complexity of the organisation of all the interaction interfaces observed when a protein lies in alternative complexes, showing that interfaces progressively add up in a hierarchical way, which is reflected in a logarithmic law for the size of the union of the interface regions on the number of distinct interfaces. We further investigate the connection of this complexity with different measures of structural disorder: the standard missing residues and a new definition, called “soft disorder”, that covers all the flexible and structurally amorphous residues of a protein. We show evidences that both the interaction interfaces and the soft disordered regions tend to involve roughly the same amino-acids of the protein, and preliminary results suggesting that soft disorder spots those surface regions where new interfaces are progressively accommodated by complex formation. In fact, our results suggest that structurally disordered regions not only carry crucial information about the location of alternative interfaces within complexes, but also about the order of the assembly. We verify these hypotheses in several examples, such as the DNA binding domains of P53 and P73, the C3 exoenzyme, and two known biological orders of assembly. We finally compare our measures of structural disorder with several disorder bioinformatics predictors, showing that these latter are optimised to predict the residues that are missing in all the alternative structures of a protein and they are not able to catch the progressive evolution of the disordered regions upon complex formation. Yet, the predicted residues, when not missing, tend to be characterised as soft disordered regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wjf4diCw_-o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Persistent thermal input controls steering behavior in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Motile organisms actively detect environmental signals and migrate to a preferable environment. Especially, small animals convert subtle spatial difference in sensory input into orientation behavioral output for directly steering toward a destination, but the neural mechanisms underlying steering behavior remain elusive. Here, we analyze a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotactic behavior in which a small number of neurons are shown to mediate steering toward a destination temperature. We construct a neuroanatomical model and use an evolutionary algorithm to find configurations of the model that reproduce empirical thermotactic behavior. We find that, in all the evolved models, steering curvature are modulated by temporally persistent thermal signals sensed beyond the time scale of sinusoidal locomotion of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Persistent rise in temperature decreases steering curvature resulting in straight movement of model worms, whereas fall in temperature increases curvature resulting in crooked movement. This relationship between temperature change and steering curvature reproduces the empirical thermotactic migration up thermal gradients and steering bias toward higher temperature. Further, spectrum decomposition of neural activities in model worms show that thermal signals are transmitted from a sensory neuron to motor neurons on the longer time scale than sinusoidal locomotion of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that employments of temporally persistent sensory signals enable small animals to steer toward a destination in natural environment with variable, noisy, and subtle cues.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k5TePF5vmfk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;White matter injury in the neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic brain and potential therapies targeting microglia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/81baedcc-b98e-4c13-8622-37a618693c83/jnr24761-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential approaches to treating neonatal H‐I injury are as follows: 1. Inhibiting M1 microglia to secrete pro‐inflammatory cytokines or to promote microglia M2 polarization. 2. Targeting OPCs and oligodendrocytes and promoting their differentiation and maturation to maintain axonal integrity and conductivity and restoring axonal functions through remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (H‐I) injury, which mainly causes neuronal damage and white matter injury (WMI), is among the predominant causes of infant morbidity (cerebral palsy, cognitive and persistent motor disabilities) and mortality. Disruptions to the oxygen and blood supply in the perinatal brain affect the cerebral microenvironment and may affect microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Microglia are significantly associated with axonal damage and myelinating oligodendrocytes, which are major pathological components of WMI. However, the effects of H‐I injury on microglial functions and underlying transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. The historical perception that these cells are major risk factors for ischemic stroke has been questioned due to our improved understanding of the diversity of microglial phenotypes and their alterable functions, which exacerbate or attenuate injuries in different regions in response to environmental instability. Unfortunately, although therapeutic hypothermia is an efficient treatment, death and disability remain the prognosis for a large proportion of neonates with H‐I injury. Hence, novel neuroprotective therapies to treat WMI following H‐I injury are urgently needed. Here, we review microglial mechanisms that might occur in the developing brain due to neonatal H‐I injury and discuss whether microglia function as a double‐edged sword in WMI. Then, we emphasize microglial heterogeneity, notably at the single‐cell level, and sex‐specific effects on the etiology of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss current knowledge of strategies aiming to improve microglia modulation and remyelination following neonatal H‐I injury. Overall, microglia‐targeted therapy might provide novel and valuable insights into the treatment of neonatal H‐I insult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Testing and code reviews are known techniques to improve the quality and
robustness of software. Unfortunately, the complexity of modern software
systems makes it impossible to anticipate all possible problems that can occur
at runtime, which limits what issues can be found using testing and reviews.
Thus, it is of interest to consider autonomous self-healing software systems,
which can automatically detect, diagnose, and contain unanticipated problems at
runtime. Most research in this area has adopted a model-driven approach, where
actual behavior is checked against a model specifying the intended behavior,
and a controller takes action when the system behaves outside of the
specification. However, it is not easy to develop these specifications, nor to
keep them up-to-date as the system evolves. We pose that, with the recent
advances in machine learning, such models may be learned by observing the
system. Moreover, we argue that artificial immune systems (AISs) are
particularly well-suited for building self-healing systems, because of their
anomaly detection and diagnosis capabilities. We present the state-of-the-art
in self-healing systems and in AISs, surveying some of the research directions
that have been considered up to now. To help advance the state-of-the-art, we
develop a research agenda for building self-healing software systems using
AISs, identifying required foundations, and promising research directions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02480</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In machine learning, the term active learning regroups techniques that aim at
selecting the most useful data to label from a large pool of unlabelled
examples. While supervised deep learning techniques have shown to be
increasingly efficient on many applications, they require a huge number of
labelled examples to reach operational performances. Therefore, the labelling
effort linked to the creation of the datasets required is also increasing. When
working on defense-related remote sensing applications, labelling can be
challenging due to the large areas covered and often requires military experts
who are rare and whose time is primarily dedicated to operational needs.
Limiting the labelling effort is thus of utmost importance. This study aims at
reviewing the most relevant active learning techniques to be used for object
detection on very high resolution imagery and shows an example of the value of
such techniques on a relevant operational use case: aircraft detection.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Drift anticipation with forgetting to improve evolving fuzzy system. (arXiv:2101.02442v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02442</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working with a non-stationary stream of data requires for the analysis system
to evolve its model (the parameters as well as the structure) over time. In
particular, concept drifts can occur, which makes it necessary to forget
knowledge that has become obsolete. However, the forgetting is subjected to the
stability-plasticity dilemma, that is, increasing forgetting improve reactivity
of adapting to the new data while reducing the robustness of the system. Based
on a set of inference rules, Evolving Fuzzy Systems-EFS-have proven to be
effective in solving the data stream learning problem. However tackling the
stability-plasticity dilemma is still an open question. This paper proposes a
coherent method to integrate forgetting in Evolving Fuzzy System, based on the
recently introduced notion of concept drift anticipation. The forgetting is
applied with two methods: an exponential forgetting of the premise part and a
deferred directional forgetting of the conclusion part of EFS to preserve the
coherence between both parts. The originality of the approach consists in
applying the forgetting only in the anticipation module and in keeping the EFS
(called principal system) learned without any forgetting. Then, when a drift is
detected in the stream, a selection mechanism is proposed to replace the
obsolete parameters of the principal system with more suitable parameters of
the anticipation module. An evaluation of the proposed methods is carried out
on benchmark online datasets, with a comparison with state-of-the-art online
classifiers (Learn++.NSE, PENsemble, pclass) as well as with the original
system using different forgetting strategies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02344</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present deep significance clustering (DICE), a framework for jointly
performing representation learning and clustering for &quot;outcome-aware&quot;
stratification. DICE is intended to generate cluster membership that may be
used to categorize a population by individual risk level for a targeted
outcome. Following the representation learning and clustering steps, we embed
the objective function in DICE with a constraint which requires a statistically
significant association between the outcome and cluster membership of learned
representations. DICE further includes a neural architecture search step to
maximize both the likelihood of representation learning and outcome
classification accuracy with cluster membership as the predictor. To
demonstrate its utility in medicine for patient risk-stratification, the
performance of DICE was evaluated using two datasets with different outcome
ratios extracted from real-world electronic health records. Outcomes are
defined as acute kidney injury (30.4\%) among a cohort of COVID-19 patients,
and discharge disposition (36.8\%) among a cohort of heart failure patients,
respectively. Extensive results demonstrate that DICE has superior performance
as measured by the difference in outcome distribution across clusters,
Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index for
clustering, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for outcome classification
compared to several baseline approaches.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02333</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gaussian Process is a non-parametric prior which can be understood as a
distribution on the function space intuitively. It is known that by introducing
appropriate prior to the weights of the neural networks, Gaussian Process can
be obtained by taking the infinite-width limit of the Bayesian neural networks
from a Bayesian perspective. In this paper, we explore the infinitely wide
Tensor Networks and show the equivalence of the infinitely wide Tensor Networks
and the Gaussian Process. We study the pure Tensor Network and another two
extended Tensor Network structures: Neural Kernel Tensor Network and Tensor
Network hidden layer Neural Network and prove that each one will converge to
the Gaussian Process as the width of each model goes to infinity. (We note here
that Gaussian Process can also be obtained by taking the infinite limit of at
least one of the bond dimensions $\alpha_{i}$ in the product of tensor nodes,
and the proofs can be done with the same ideas in the proofs of the
infinite-width cases.) We calculate the mean function (mean vector) and the
covariance function (covariance matrix) of the finite dimensional distribution
of the induced Gaussian Process by the infinite-width tensor network with a
general set-up. We study the properties of the covariance function and derive
the approximation of the covariance function when the integral in the
expectation operator is intractable. In the numerical experiments, we implement
the Gaussian Process corresponding to the infinite limit tensor networks and
plot the sample paths of these models. We study the hyperparameters and plot
the sample path families in the induced Gaussian Process by varying the
standard deviations of the prior distributions. As expected, the parameters in
the prior distribution namely the hyper-parameters in the induced Gaussian
Process controls the characteristic lengthscales of the Gaussian Process.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13290</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is concerned with the utilization of deterministically modeled
chemical reaction networks for the implementation of (feed-forward) neural
networks. We develop a general mathematical framework and prove that the
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) associated with certain reaction network
implementations of neural networks have desirable properties including (i)
existence of unique positive fixed points that are smooth in the parameters of
the model (necessary for gradient descent), and (ii) fast convergence to the
fixed point regardless of initial condition (necessary for efficient
implementation). We do so by first making a connection between neural networks
and fixed points for systems of ODEs, and then by constructing reaction
networks with the correct associated set of ODEs. We demonstrate the theory by
constructing a reaction network that implements a neural network with a
smoothed ReLU activation function, though we also demonstrate how to generalize
the construction to allow for other activation functions (each with the
desirable properties listed previously). As there are multiple types of
&quot;networks&quot; utilized in this paper, we also give a careful introduction to both
reaction networks and neural networks, in order to disambiguate the overlapping
vocabulary in the two settings and to clearly highlight the role of each
network's properties.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12948</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the time series classification domain, shapelets are small time series
that are discriminative for a certain class. It has been shown that classifiers
are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a plethora of datasets by
taking as input distances from the input time series to different
discriminative shapelets. Additionally, these shapelets can easily be
visualized and thus possess an interpretable characteristic, making them very
appealing in critical domains, such as the health care domain, where
longitudinal data is ubiquitous. In this study, a new paradigm for shapelet
discovery is proposed, which is based upon evolutionary computation. The
advantages of the proposed approach are that (i) it is gradient-free, which
could allow to escape from local optima more easily and to find suited
candidates more easily and supports non-differentiable objectives, (ii) no
brute-force search is required, which drastically reduces the computational
complexity by several orders of magnitude, (iii) the total amount of shapelets
and length of each of these shapelets are evolved jointly with the shapelets
themselves, alleviating the need to specify this beforehand, (iv) entire sets
are evaluated at once as opposed to single shapelets, which results in smaller
final sets with less similar shapelets that result in similar predictive
performances, and (v) discovered shapelets do not need to be a subsequence of
the input time series. We present the results of experiments which validate the
enumerated advantages.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 08 January 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-020-00415-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41583-020-00415-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The molecular basis of trans-synaptic signalling by Neurexins plays an important role in synapse organization. In this Review, Scheiffele and colleagues link cell type-specific alternative splicing to the combinatorial action of Neurexin isoforms, and provide a mechanistic framework for Neurexin functions in synapse organization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/WMZxRkvEzpY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Neuroimaging Biomarkers and Neurocognitive Outcomes in Pediatric Medulloblastoma Patients: a Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01225-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Medulloblastoma is a malign posterior fossa brain tumor, mostly occurring in childhood. The CNS-directed chemoradiotherapy treatment can be very harmful to the developing brain and functional outcomes of these patients. However, what the underlying neurotoxic mechanisms are remain inconclusive. Hence, this review summarizes the existing literature on the association between advanced neuroimaging and neurocognitive changes in patients that were treated for pediatric medulloblastoma. The PubMed/Medline database was extensively screened for studies investigating the link between cognitive outcomes and multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in childhood medulloblastoma survivors. A behavioral meta-analysis was performed on the available IQ scores. A total of 649 studies were screened, of which 22 studies were included. Based on this literature review, we conclude medulloblastoma patients to be at risk for white matter volume loss, more frequent white matter lesions, and changes in white matter microstructure. Such microstructural alterations were associated with lower IQ, which reached the clinical cut-off in survivors across studies. Using functional MR scans, changes in activity were observed in cerebellar areas, associated with working memory and processing speed. Finally, cerebral microbleeds were encountered more often, but these were not associated with cognitive outcomes. Regarding intervention studies, computerized cognitive training was associated with changes in prefrontal and cerebellar activation and physical training might result in microstructural and cortical alterations. Hence, to better define the neural targets for interventions in pediatric medulloblastoma patients, this review suggests working towards neuroimaging-based predictions of cognitive outcomes. To reach this goal, large multimodal prospective imaging studies are highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Photobiomodulation Promotes Neuronal Axon Regeneration After Oxidative Stress and Induces a Change in Polarization from M1 to M2 in Macrophages via Stimulation of CCL2 in Neurons: Relevance to Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; irradiation area, 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 440 s). About 100 μM H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Noise induced quiescence of epileptic spike generation in patients with epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clinical scalp electroencephalographic recordings from patients with epilepsy are distinguished by the presence of epileptic discharges &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; spikes or sharp waves. These often occur randomly on a background of fluctuating potentials. The spike rate varies between different brain states (sleep and awake) and patients. Epileptogenic tissue and regions near these often show increased spike rates in comparison to other cortical regions. Several studies have shown a relation between spike rate and background activity although the underlying reason for this is still poorly understood. Both these processes, spike occurrence and background activity show evidence of being at least partly stochastic processes. In this study we show that epileptic discharges seen on scalp electroencephalographic recordings and background activity are driven at least partly by a common biological noise. Furthermore, our results indicate noise induced quiescence of spike generation which, in analogy with computational models of spiking, indicate spikes to be generated by transitions between semi-stable states of the brain, similar to the generation of epileptic seizure activity. The deepened physiological understanding of spike generation in epilepsy that this study provides could be useful in the electrophysiological assessment of different therapies for epilepsy including the effect of different drugs or electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Defective Autophagy and Mitophagy in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is the time-dependent process that all living organisms go through characterized by declining physiological function due to alterations in metabolic and molecular pathways. Many decades of research have been devoted to uncovering the cellular changes and progression of aging and have revealed that not all organisms with the same chronological age exhibit the same age-related declines in physiological function. In assessing biological age, factors such as epigenetic changes, telomere length, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in rescue mechanisms such as autophagy all play major roles. Recent studies have focused on autophagy dysfunction in aging, particularly on mitophagy due to its major role in energy generation and reactive oxidative species generation of mitochondria. Mitophagy has been implicated in playing a role in the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The purpose of our article is to highlight the mechanisms of autophagy and mitophagy and how defects in these pathways contribute to the physiological markers of aging and AD. This article also discusses how mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, impaired biogenesis, and defective mitophagy are related to aging and AD progression. This article highlights recent studies of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau in relation to autophagy and mitophagy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Unipolar (Dendritic) Brush Cells Are Morphologically Complex and Require Tbr2 for Differentiation and Migration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.598548</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.598548</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated specific expression of transcription factor Tbr2 in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the cerebellum during development and adulthood. To further study UBCs and the role of Tbr2 in their development we examined UBC morphology in transgenic mouse lines (reporter and lineage tracer) and also examined the effects of Tbr2 deficiency in Tbr2 (MGI: Eomes) conditional knock-out (cKO) mice. In Tbr2 reporter and lineage tracer cerebellum, UBCs exhibited more complex morphologies than previously reported including multiple dendrites, bifurcating dendrites, and up to four dendritic brushes. We propose that “dendritic brush cells” (DBCs) may be a more apt nomenclature. In Tbr2 cKO cerebellum, mature UBCs were completely absent. Migration of UBC precursors from rhombic lip to cerebellar cortex and other nuclei was impaired in Tbr2 cKO mice. Our results indicate that UBC migration and differentiation are sensitive to Tbr2 deficiency. To investigate whether UBCs develop similarly in humans as in rodents, we studied Tbr2 expression in mid-gestational human cerebellum. Remarkably, Tbr2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; UBC precursors migrate along the same pathways in humans as in rodent cerebellum and disperse to create the same “fountain-like” appearance characteristic of UBCs exiting the rhombic lip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Unraveling the Nanoscopic Organization and Function of Central Mammalian Presynapses With Super-Resolution Microscopy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The complex, nanoscopic scale of neuronal function, taking place at dendritic spines, axon terminals, and other minuscule structures, cannot be adequately resolved using standard, diffraction-limited imaging techniques. The last couple of decades saw a rapid evolution of imaging methods that overcome the diffraction limit imposed by Abbe’s principle. These techniques, including structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion (STED), photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), among others, have revolutionized our understanding of synapse biology. By exploiting the stochastic nature of fluorophore light/dark states or non-linearities in the interaction of fluorophores with light, by using modified illumination strategies that limit the excitation area, these methods can achieve spatial resolutions down to just a few tens of nm or less. Here, we review how these advanced imaging techniques have contributed to unprecedented insight into the nanoscopic organization and function of mammalian neuronal presynapses, revealing new organizational principles or lending support to existing views, while raising many important new questions. We further discuss recent technical refinements and newly developed tools that will continue to expand our ability to delve deeper into how synaptic function is orchestrated at the nanoscopic level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Critical and Ictal Phases in Simulated EEG Signals on a Small-World Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.583350</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy brain function is marked by neuronal network dynamics at or near the critical phase, which separates regimes of instability and stasis. A failure to remain at this critical point can lead to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, which is associated with pathological synchronization of neuronal oscillations. Using full Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) simulations on a Small-World Network, we are able to generate synthetic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with intervals corresponding to seizure (ictal) or non-seizure (interictal) states that can occur based on the hyperexcitability of the artificial neurons and the strength and topology of the synaptic connections between them. These interictal simulations can be further classified into scale-free critical phases and disjoint subcritical exponential phases. By changing the HH parameters, we can model seizures due to a variety of causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), congenital channelopathies, and idiopathic etiologies, as well as the effects of anticonvulsant drugs. The results of this work may be used to help identify parameters from actual patient EEG or electrocorticographic (ECoG) data associated with ictogenesis, as well as generating simulated data for training machine-learning seizure prediction algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Macrophages Respond Rapidly to Ototoxic Injury of Lateral Line Hair Cells but Are Not Required for Hair Cell Regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.613246</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sensory organs of the inner ear contain resident populations of macrophages, which are recruited to sites of cellular injury. Such macrophages are known to phagocytose the debris of dying cells but the full role of macrophages in otic pathology is not understood. Lateral line neuromasts of zebrafish contain hair cells that are nearly identical to those in the inner ear, and the optical clarity of larval zebrafish permits direct imaging of cellular interactions. In this study, we used larval zebrafish to characterize the response of macrophages to ototoxic injury of lateral line hair cells. Macrophages migrated into neuromasts within 20 min of exposure to the ototoxic antibiotic neomycin. The number of macrophages in the near vicinity of injured neuromasts was similar to that observed near uninjured neuromasts, suggesting that this early inflammatory response was mediated by “local” macrophages. Upon entering injured neuromasts, macrophages actively phagocytosed hair cell debris. The injury-evoked migration of macrophages was significantly reduced by inhibition of Src-family kinases. Using chemical-genetic ablation of macrophages before the ototoxic injury, we also examined whether macrophages were essential for the initiation of hair cell regeneration. Results revealed only minor differences in hair cell recovery in macrophage-depleted vs. control fish, suggesting that macrophages are not essential for the regeneration of lateral line hair cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Characterization of Feedback Neurons in the High-Level Visual Cortical Areas That Project Directly to the Primary Visual Cortex in the Cat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies indicate that top-down influence plays a critical role in visual information processing and perceptual detection. However, the substrate that carries top-down influence remains poorly understood. Using a combined technique of retrograde neuronal tracing and immunofluorescent double labeling, we characterized the distribution and cell type of feedback neurons in cat’s high-level visual cortical areas that send direct connections to the primary visual cortex (V1: area 17). Our results showed: (1) the high-level visual cortex of area 21a at the ventral stream and PMLS area at the dorsal stream have a similar proportion of feedback neurons back projecting to the V1 area, (2) the distribution of feedback neurons in the higher-order visual area 21a and PMLS was significantly denser than in the intermediate visual cortex of area 19 and 18, (3) feedback neurons in all observed high-level visual cortex were found in layer II–III, IV, V, and VI, with a higher proportion in layer II–III, V, and VI than in layer IV, and (4) most feedback neurons were CaMKII-positive excitatory neurons, and few of them were identified as inhibitory GABAergic neurons. These results may argue against the segregation of ventral and dorsal streams during visual information processing, and support “reverse hierarchy theory” or interactive model proposing that recurrent connections between V1 and higher-order visual areas constitute the functional circuits that mediate visual perception. Also, the corticocortical feedback neurons from high-level visual cortical areas to the V1 area are mostly excitatory in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Striatal Transcriptome Reveals Differences Between Cognitively Impaired and Unimpaired Aged Male Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.611572</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.611572</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive processes require striatal activity. The underlying molecular mechanisms are widely unknown. For this reason the striatal transcriptome of young (YM), aged cognitively impaired (OMB), and unimpaired (OMG) male rats was analyzed. The global comparison of transcripts reveal a higher number of differences between OMG and YM as compared to OMB and YM. Hierarchical clustering detects differences in up- and down-regulated gene clusters in OMG and OMB when compared to YM. In OMG we found more single genes to be specifically regulated in this group than in OMB when compared to young. These genes were considered as cognition specific, whereas genes shared in OMG and OMB were considered as age specific. OMB specific up-regulated genes are related to negative control of cell differentiation and transcription (Hopx), to phagocytosis (Cd202) and cell adhesion (Pcdhb21), whereas down-regulated genes are related to associative learning, behavioral fear response and synaptic transmission (Gabra5). OMG specific up-regulated genes are in the context of maintenance of transcription and estrogen receptor signaling (Padi2, Anxa3), signal transduction [Rassf4, Dock8)], sterol regulation (Srebf1), and complement activity (C4a, C4b). Down-regulated genes are related to lipid oxidation reduction processes (Far2) and positive regulation of axon extension (Islr2). These relations were supported by pathway analysis, which reveals cholesterol metabolism processes in both aged group and cholesterol biosynthesis specifically in OMG; adipogenesis and focal adhesion in OMB. In OMG glucuronidation, estrogen metabolism, inflammatory responses and TGF beta signaling where detected as specific for this group. Signal transduction of the sphingosine-1-phospate-receptor (S1P) receptor was the main pathway difference in the comparison of OMB and OMG with downregulated genes in the first group. This difference could also be observed in the OMB vs. YM comparison but not in the OMG vs. YM analysis. Thus, an up-regulation of cognition related genes could be observed in OMG compared to OMB rats. The S1P pathway discriminated between OMB and OMG as well as between OMB and OMG. Since this pathway has been described as essential for cognitive processes in the striatum of mice, it may, among steroid hormone signaling, significantly contribute to the maintenance of cognitive processes in OMG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Comparison of Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloidogenic Nanoplaques With Core Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are essential for early diagnosis and intervention. Available biomarkers are not sufficient to permit the monitoring of AD progression over time, and additional biomarkers are required. Measures of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) could be useful biomarkers for AD. Here, we investigate whether levels of Thioflavin-T (ThT) positive amyloid aggregates, i.e., nanoplaques, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could serve as useful biomarkers for AD. One-hundred and eighteen memory clinic patients were AT(N) classified, and CSF nanoplaque concentrations were compared between patients on the “Alzheimer’s continuum” (A+ patients) and patients with “Normal AD biomarkers” or “Non-AD pathologic change” (A− patients). CSF nanoplaque concentrations and sizes were quantified using the novel ThT-Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ThT-FCS) assay, and core biomarkers (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, total tau and phosphorylated tau) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We investigated the association between nanoplaque concentrations and core biomarkers, and the diagnostic value of nanoplaque levels. Nanoplaque levels were increased in A+ patients compared to A− patients. Nanoplaque concentrations were negatively associated with Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, but not related to total tau or phosphorylated tau measures. Quantification of nanoplaques did not improve the classification of patients on the Alzheimer’s continuum compared to the core biomarkers alone. Dynamic changes in nanoplaques concentration and size throughout AD stages should be explored in longitudinal studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Whole genome phylogenies reflect the distributions of recombination rates for many bacterial species</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65366</link>
	<description>Although recombination is accepted to be common in bacteria, for many species robust phylogenies with well-resolved branches can be reconstructed from whole genome alignments of strains, and these are generally interpreted to reflect clonal relationships. Using new methods based on the statistics of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) splits, we show that this interpretation is incorrect. For many species, each locus has recombined many times along its line of descent, and instead of many loci supporting a common phylogeny, the phylogeny changes many thousands of times along the genome alignment. Analysis of the patterns of allele sharing among strains shows that bacterial populations cannot be approximated as either clonal or freely recombining, but are structured such that recombination rates between lineages vary over several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage. Thus, rather than reflecting clonal ancestry, whole genome phylogenies reflect distributions of recombination rates.</description>

	<description>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe tick-borne febrile illness with wide geographic distribution. CCHF is caused by infection with the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and case fatality rates can be as high as 30%. Despite causing severe disease in humans, our understanding of the host and viral determinants of CCHFV pathogenesis are limited. A major limitation in the investigation of CCHF has been the lack of suitable small animal models. Wild-type mice are resistant to clinical isolates of CCHFV and consequently, mice must be deficient in type I interferon responses to study the more severe aspects of CCHFV. We report here a mouse-adapted variant of CCHFV that recapitulates in adult, immunocompetent mice the severe CCHF observed in humans. This mouse-adapted variant of CCHFV significantly improves our ability to study host and viral determinants of CCHFV-induced disease in a highly tractable mouse model.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mutations in SKI in Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome lead to attenuated TGF-β responses through SKI stabilization</title>

	<description>Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder, with considerable clinical overlap with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes. These syndromes have commonly been associated with enhanced TGF-β signaling. In SGS patients, heterozygous point mutations have been mapped to the transcriptional corepressor SKI, which is a negative regulator of TGF-b signaling that is rapidly degraded upon ligand stimulation. The molecular consequences of these mutations, however, are not understood. Here we use a combination of structural biology, genome editing and biochemistry to show that SGS mutations in SKI abolish its binding to phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3. This results in stabilization of SKI and consequently attenuation of TGF-β responses, in both knockin cells expressing an SGS mutation, and in fibroblasts from SGS patients. Thus, we reveal that SGS is associated with an attenuation of TGF-b-induced transcriptional responses, and not enhancement, which has important implications for other Marfan-related syndromes.</description>

	<description>Tuberculous meningitis has high mortality, linked to excessive inflammation. However, adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by only 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes only a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the leukotriene A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrolase (&lt;i&gt;LTA4H&lt;/i&gt;) gene encoding an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids. &lt;i&gt;LTA4H&lt;/i&gt; TT patients with increased expression had increased survival, consistent with corticosteroids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, an Indonesia study did not find an &lt;i&gt;LTA4H&lt;/i&gt; TT genotype survival benefit. Here using Bayesian methods to analyse both studies, we find that &lt;i&gt;LTA4H&lt;/i&gt; TT genotype confers survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. &lt;i&gt;LTA4H&lt;/i&gt; genotyping together with disease severity assessment may target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it.</description>

	<description>The oncoprotein transcription factor MYC is a major driver of malignancy and a highly validated but challenging target for the development of anticancer therapies. Novel strategies to inhibit MYC may come from understanding the co-factors it uses to drive pro-tumorigenic gene expression programs, providing their role in MYC activity is understood. Here we interrogate how one MYC co-factor, host cell factor (HCF)–1, contributes to MYC activity in a human Burkitt lymphoma setting. We identify genes connected to mitochondrial function and ribosome biogenesis as direct MYC/HCF-1 targets and demonstrate how modulation of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction influences cell growth, metabolite profiles, global gene expression patterns, and tumor growth in vivo. This work defines HCF-1 as a critical MYC co-factor, places the MYC–HCF-1 interaction in biological context, and highlights HCF-1 as a focal point for development of novel anti-MYC therapies.</description>

	<description>Hundreds of human genes are associated with neurological diseases, but translation into tractable biological mechanisms is lagging. Larval zebrafish are an attractive model to investigate genetic contributions to neurological diseases. However, current CRISPR-Cas9 methods are difficult to apply to large genetic screens studying behavioural phenotypes. To facilitate rapid genetic screening, we developed a simple sequencing-free tool to validate gRNAs and a highly effective CRISPR-Cas9 method capable of converting &amp;gt;90% of injected embryos directly into F0 biallelic knockouts. We demonstrate that F0 knockouts reliably recapitulate complex mutant phenotypes, such as altered molecular rhythms of the circadian clock, escape responses to irritants, and multi-parameter day-night locomotor behaviours. The technique is sufficiently robust to knockout multiple genes in the same animal, for example to create the transparent triple knockout &lt;i&gt;crystal&lt;/i&gt; fish for imaging. Our F0 knockout method cuts the experimental time from gene to behavioural phenotype in zebrafish from months to one week.</description>

	<title>eLife: Methotrexate attenuates vascular inflammation through an adenosine-microRNA dependent pathway</title>

	<description>Endothelial cell (EC) activation is an early hallmark in the pathogenesis of chronic vascular diseases. MicroRNA-181b (&lt;i&gt;MiR-181b&lt;/i&gt;) is an important anti-inflammatory mediator in the vascular endothelium affecting endotoxemia, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. Herein, we identify that the drug methotrexate (MTX) and its downstream metabolite adenosine exert anti-inflammatory effects in the vascular endothelium by targeting and activating &lt;i&gt;MiR-181b&lt;/i&gt; expression. Both systemic and endothelial-specific &lt;i&gt;MiR-181a2b2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice develop vascular inflammation, white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance in a diet-induced obesity model. Moreover, MTX attenuated diet-induced WAT inflammation, insulin resistance, and EC activation in a &lt;i&gt;MiR-181a2b2&lt;/i&gt;-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MTX attenuated cytokine-induced EC activation through a unique adenosine-adenosine receptor A3-SMAD3/4-&lt;i&gt;MiR-181b&lt;/i&gt; signaling cascade. These findings establish an essential role of endothelial &lt;i&gt;MiR-181b&lt;/i&gt; in controlling vascular inflammation and that restoring &lt;i&gt;MiR-181b&lt;/i&gt; in ECs by high dose MTX or adenosine signaling may provide a potential therapeutic opportunity for anti-inflammatory therapy.</description>

	<title>eLife: Universal and taxon-specific trends in protein sequences as a function of age</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57347</link>
	<description>Extant protein-coding sequences span a huge range of ages, from those that emerged only recently, to those present in the last universal common ancestor. Because evolution has had less time to act on young sequences, there might be 'phylostratigraphy' trends in any properties that evolve slowly with age. A long-term reduction in hydrophobicity and hydrophobic clustering was found in previous, taxonomically restricted studies. Here we perform integrated phylostratigraphy across 435 fully sequenced species, using sensitive HMM methods to detect protein domain homology. We find that the reduction in hydrophobic clustering is universal across lineages. However, only young animal domains have a tendency to have higher structural disorder. Among ancient domains, trends in amino acid composition reflect the order of recruitment into the genetic code, suggesting that the composition of the contemporary descendants of ancient sequences reflects amino acid availability during the earliest stages of life, when these sequences first emerged.</description>

	<description>Learning to control a brain-machine interface (BMI) is associated with the emergence of coordinated neural dynamics in populations of neurons whose activity serves as direct input to the BMI decoder (direct subpopulation). While previous work shows differential modification of firing rate modulation in this population relative to a population whose activity was not directly input to the BMI decoder (indirect subpopulation), little is known about how learning-rated changes in cortical population dynamics within these groups compare. To investigate this, we monitored both direct and indirect subpopulations as two macaque monkeys learned to control a BMI. We found that while the combined population increased coordinated neural dynamics, this coordination was primarily driven by changes in the direct subpopulation while the indirect subpopulation remained relatively stable. These findings indicate that motor cortex refines cortical dynamics throughout the entire network during learning, with a more pronounced effect in ensembles causally linked to behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Test-retest reliability of tone- and 40 Hz train-evoked gamma oscillations in female rats and their sensitivity to low-dose NMDA channel blockade</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425905v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425905v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Rationale: Schizophrenia patients consistently show deficits in sensory-evoked broadband gamma oscillations and click-evoked entrainment at 40 Hz, called the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Since such evoked oscillations depend on cortical N-methyl D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-mediated network activity, they can serve as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the preclinical development of drug candidates engaging these circuits. However, there is little test-retest reliability data in preclinical species, a prerequisite for within-subject testing paradigms. Objectives: We investigated the long-term stability of these measures in a rodent model. Methods: Female rats with chronic epidural implants were used to record tone- and 40 Hz click-evoked responses at multiple time points and across six sessions, spread over 3 weeks. We assessed reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Separately, we used mixed-effects ANOVA to examine time and session effects. Individual subject variability was determined using the coefficient of variation (CV). Lastly, to illustrate the importance of long-term measure stability for within-subject testing design, we used low to moderate doses of an NMDA antagonist MK801 (0.025-0.15 mg/kg) to disrupt the evoked responses. Results: We found that 40 Hz ASSR showed good reliability (ICC=0.60-0.75) while the reliability of tone-evoked gamma ranged from poor to good (0.33-0.67). We noted time but no session effects. Subjects showed a lower variance for ASSR over tone-evoked gamma. Both measures were dose-dependently attenuated by NMDA antagonism. Conclusion: Overall, while both measures use NMDA transmission, 40 Hz ASSR showed superior psychometric properties of higher ICC and lower CV, relative to tone-evoked gamma.</description>

	<description>Brain-matter vacuolation is a defining trait of all prion diseases, yet its cause is unknown. Here we report that prion infection and prion-mimetic antibodies deplete the phosphatidylinositol kinase PIKfyve in mouse brains, cultured cells, organotypic brain slices, and in brains of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease victims. We found that PIKfyve, an inositol kinase involved endolysosomal maturation, is acylated by zDHHC9 and zDHHC21, whose juxtavesicular topology is disturbed by prion infection, resulting in PIKfyve deacylation and destabilization. A protracted unfolded protein response (UPR), typical of prion diseases, also induced PIKfyve deacylation and degradation. Conversely, UPR antagonists restored PIKfyve levels in prion-infected cells. Overexpression of zDHHC9 and zDHHC21, administration of the antiprion polythiophene LIN5044, or supplementation with the PIKfyve reaction product PI(3,5)P2, suppressed prion-induced vacuolation. Thus, PIKfyve emerges as a central mediator of vacuolation and neurotoxicity in prion diseases.</description>

	<description>Nociceptive processing in the human brain is a signal that enables harm avoidance, with large interindividual variance. The relative contributions of genes and environment to the neural structures that support nociception have not been studied in twins previously. Here, we employed a classic twin-design to determine brain structures influenced by additive genetics. We found genetic influences on nociceptive processing in the midcingulate cortex, bilateral posterior insulae and thalamus. In addition to brain activations, we found genetic contributions to large-scale functional connectivity during nociceptive processing. We conclude that additive genetics influence specific aspects of nociceptive processing, which improves our understanding of human nociceptive processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct regulation of dopamine D3 receptor in the basolateral amygdala and dentate gyrus during the reinstatement of cocaine CPP induced by drug priming and social stress</title>

	<description>Relapse in cocaine seeking and intake is one of the main challenges when treating its addiction. Among the triggering factors for recurrence of cocaine use are the re-exposure to the drug and stressful events. Cocaine relapse engages the activity of memory-related nuclei, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), which are responsible for emotional and episodic memories. Besides, D3 receptor (D3R) antagonists have recently arisen as a potential treatment for preventing drug relapse. Thus, we have assessed the impact of D3R blockade in the expression of some dopaminergic markers and in the activity of the mTOR pathway, that is modulated by D3R, in the BLA and DG during the reinstatement of cocaine-induced CPP evoked by drug priming and social stress. Reinstatement of cocaine-CPP paralleled with a trend to increase of D3R and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in the BLA. Social stress- but not drug-induced reactivation of cocaine memories was prevented by systemic administration of SB-277011-A (a selective D3R antagonist), that was able, however, to impede D3R and DAT up-regulation in the BLA during CPP reinstatement evoked by both stress and cocaine. Concomitantly with cocaine-CPP reactivation occurred a diminution of mTOR phosphorylation (activation) in the BLA and DG that was inhibited by D3R blockade in both nuclei before the social stress episode, and only in the BLA when CPP reinstatement was provoked by a cocaine prime. Our data, while support a main role for D3R signalling in the BLA in the reactivation of cocaine memories evoked by social stress, indicates that different neural circuits and signalling mechanisms might mediate in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviours depending upon the triggering stimuli.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Heart rate variability predicts decline in sensorimotor rhythm control</title>

	<description>Voluntary control of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR, 8-12 Hz) can be used for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based operation of an assistive hand exoskeleton, e.g., in finger paralysis after stroke. To gain SMR control, stroke survivors are usually instructed to engage in motor imagery (MI) or to attempt moving the paralyzed fingers resulting in task- or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of SMR (SMR-ERD). However, as these tasks are cognitively demanding, especially for stroke survivors suffering from cognitive impairments, BCI control performance can deteriorate considerably over time. It would thus be important to identify biomarkers that predict decline in BCI control performance within an ongoing session in order to optimize the man-machine interaction scheme. Here we determine the link between BCI control performance over time and heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we investigated whether HRV can be used as a biomarker to predict decline during voluntary control of SMR-ERD across 17 healthy participants using Granger causality. SMR-ERD was visually displayed on a screen. Participants were instructed to engage in MI-based SMR-ERD control over two consecutive runs of 8.5 minutes each. During the second run, task difficulty was gradually increased. While control performance (p = .18) and HRV (p = .16) remained unchanged across participants during the first run, during the second run, both measures declined over time at high correlation (performance: -0.61%/10s, p = 0; HRV: -0.007ms/10s, p &amp;lt; .001). We found that HRV Granger-caused BCI control performance (p &amp;lt; .001) exhibited predictive characteristics of HRV on an individual participant level. These results suggest that HRV can predict decline in BCI performance paving the way for adaptive BCI control paradigms, e.g., to individualize and optimize assistive BCI systems in stroke.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Using dual-calibrated functional MRI to map brain oxygen supply and consumption in multiple sclerosis</title>

	<description>Evidence suggests that cerebrovascular function and oxygen consumption are altered in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we quantified the vascular and oxygen metabolic MRI burden in patients with MS (PwMS) and assessed the relationship between these MRI measures of and metrics of damage and disability. In PwMS and in matched healthy volunteers, we applied a newly developed dual-calibrated fMRI method of acquisition and analysis to map grey matter (GM) cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and effective oxygen diffusivity of the capillary network (DC). We also quantified physical and cognitive function in PwMS and controls. There was no significant difference in GM volume between 22 PwMS and 20 healthy controls (p=0.302). Significant differences in CBF (PwMS vs. controls: 44.91 +/- 6.10 vs. 48.90 +/- 5.87 ml/100g/min, p=0.010), CMRO2 (117.69 +/- 17.31 vs. 136.49 +/- 14.48 mol/100g/min p&amp;lt;0.001) and DC (2.70 +/- 0.51 vs. 3.18 +/- 0.41 mol/100g/mmHg/min, p=0.002) were observed in the PwMS. No significant between-group differences were observed for OEF (PwMS vs. controls: 0.38 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.02, p=0.358). Regional analysis showed widespread reductions in CMRO2 and DC for PwMS compared to healthy volunteers. There was a significant correlation between physiological measures and T2 lesion volume, but no association with current clinical disability. Our findings demonstrate concurrent reductions in oxygen supply and consumption in the absence of an alteration in oxygen extraction that may be indicative of a reduced demand for oxygen (O2), an impaired transfer of O2 from capillaries to mitochondria, and/or a reduced ability to utilise O2 that is available at the mitochondria. With no between-group differences in GM volume, our results suggest that changes in brain physiology may precede MRI-detectable GM loss and thus may be one of the pathological drivers of neurodegeneration and disease progression.</description>

	<description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique has been shown to increase the excitability of targeted brain area and influence endurance exercise performance. However, tDCS-mediated interaction between corticospinal excitability, GABAA mediated intracortical inhibition and endurance exercise performance remains understudied. In two separate sessions, twelve subjects performed fatigue cycling exercise (80% peak power output) sustained to task failure in a double-blinded design, following either ten minutes of anodal tDCS (atDCS) or sham. Corticospinal excitability and short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were measured at baseline, post neuromodulation and post-exercise using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a resting hand muscle. There was a greater a decrease in SICI (P &amp;lt; 0.05) post fatigue cycling with atDCS priming compared to sham. Time to task failure (TTF) was significantly increased following atDCS compared to sham (P &amp;lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that atDCS applied over the motor cortex can augment cycling exercise performance; and this outcome may be mediated via a decrease in the excitability of GABAA inhibitory interneurons.</description>

	<description>Fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS) is a causative gene of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutated FUS causes accumulation of DNA damage and cytosolic stress granule (SG) formation, thereby motor neuron (MN) death. However, key molecular aetiology remains unclear. Here, we applied a novel platform technology, iBRN, ''Non- biased'' Bayesian gene regulatory network analysis based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell model, to elucidate the molecular aetiology using transcriptome of iPSC-derived MNs harboring FUSH517D. iBRN revealed ''hub molecules'', which strongly influenced transcriptome network, such as miR-125b-5p-TIMELESS axis and PRKDC for the molecular aetiology. Next, we confirmed miR-125b-5p-TIMELESS axis in FUS H517D MNs such that miR-125b-5p regulated several DNA repair-related genes including TIMELESS. In addition, we validated both introduction of miR-125b-5p and knocking down of TIMELESS caused DNA damage in the cell culture model. Furthermore, PRKDC was strongly associated with FUS mis-localization into SGs by DNA damage under impaired DNA-PK activity. Collectively, our iBRN strategy provides the first compelling evidence to elucidate molecular aetiology in neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>PurposeTo improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of highly accelerated volumetric MRI while preserve realistic textures using a generative adversarial network (GAN).

MethodsA hybrid GAN for denoising entitled &quot;HDnGAN&quot; with a 3D generator and a 2D discriminator was proposed to denoise 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images acquired in 2.75 minutes (R=3x2) using wave-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (Wave-CAIPI). HDnGAN was trained on data from 25 multiple sclerosis patients by minimizing a combined mean squared error and adversarial loss with adjustable weight{lambda} . Results were evaluated on eight separate patients by comparing to standard T2-SPACE FLAIR images acquired in 7.25 minutes (R=2x2) using mean absolute error (MAE), peak SNR (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and VGG perceptual loss, and by two neuroradiologists using a five-point score regarding gray-white matter contrast, sharpness, SNR, lesion conspicuity, and overall quality.

ResultsHDnGAN ({lambda}=0) produced the lowest MAE, highest PSNR and SSIM. HDnGAN ({lambda}=10-3) produced the lowest VGG loss. In the reader study, HDnGAN ({lambda}=10-3) significantly improved the gray-white contrast and SNR of Wave-CAIPI images, and outperformed BM4D and HDnGAN ({lambda}=0) regarding image sharpness. The overall quality score from HDnGAN ({lambda}=10-3) was significantly higher than those from Wave-CAIPI, BM4D, and HDnGAN ({lambda}=0), with no significant difference compared to standard images.

ConclusionHDnGAN concurrently benefits from improved image synthesis performance of 3D convolution and increased training samples for training the 2D discriminator on limited data. HDnGAN generates images with high SNR and realistic textures, similar to those acquired in longer times and preferred by neuroradiologists.</description>

	<description>Intrinsic brain dynamics co-fluctuate between distant regions in an organized manner during rest, establishing large-scale functional networks. We investigate these brain dynamics on a millisecond time scale by focusing on Electroencephalographic (EEG) source analyses. While synchrony is thought of as a neuronal mechanism grouping distant neuronal populations into assemblies, the relevance of simultaneous zero-lag synchronization between brain areas in humans remains largely unexplored. This negligence is due to the confound of volume conduction, leading inherently to temporal dependencies of source estimates derived from scalp EEG (and Magnetoencephalography, MEG), referred to as spatial leakage. Here, we focus on the analyses of simultaneous, i.e., quasi zero-lag related, synchronization that cannot be explained by spatial leakage phenomenon. In eighteen subjects during rest with eyes closed, we provide evidence that first, simultaneous synchronization is present between distant brain areas and second, that this long-range synchronization is occurring in brief epochs, i.e., 54-80 milliseconds. Simultaneous synchronization might signify the functional convergence of remote neuronal populations. Given the simultaneity of distant regions, these synchronization patterns might relate to the representation and maintenance, rather than processing of information. This long-range synchronization is briefly stable, not persistently, indicating flexible spatial reconfiguration pertaining to the establishment of particular, re-occurring states. Taken together, we suggest that the balance between temporal stability and spatial flexibility of long-range, simultaneous synchronization patterns is characteristic of the dynamic coordination of large-scale functional brain networks. As such, quasi zero-phase related EEG source fluctuations are physiologically meaningful if spatial leakage is considered appropriately.</description>

	<description>The power of one's social environment to modulate cognition is well documented, but the processes by which social experiences impact the cellular substrates of memory remain unknown. We show that social experience, but not physical stress, causes reactivation of fear engrams in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and optogenetic stimulation of social ensembles containing these reactivated cells is sufficient to drive fearful behavior. This endogenous reactivation in the dentate gyrus during social stress is followed by a context-specific enhancement of fear recall and reinstatement. Our findings suggest that social interactions can reactivate pre-existing engrams and thereby strengthen discrete memories.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Topological impact of negative links on the stability of resting-state brain network</title>

	<description>Stability is a physical attribute that stands opposite the change. However, it is still unclear how the arrangement of links called topology affects network stability. In this study, we tackled this issue in the resting-state brain network using structural balance. Structural balance theory employs the quality of triadic associations between signed links to determine the network stability. In this study, we showed that negative links of the resting-state network make hubs to reduce balance-energy and push the network into a more stable state compared to null-networks with trivial topologies. In this regard, we created a global measure entitled &quot;tendency to make hub&quot; to assess the hubness of the network. Besides, we revealed nodal degrees of negative links have an exponential distribution that confirms the existence of negative hubs. Our findings indicate that the arrangement of negative links plays an important role in the balance (stability) of the resting-state brain network.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Astrocyte Regional Heterogeneity Revealed Through Machine Learning‐based Glial Neuroanatomical Assays</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Astrocyte Regional Heterogeneity Revealed Through Machine Learning‐based Glial Neuroanatomical Assays&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd770e84-c31a-4b1a-bfb3-7d14e6cad36c/cne25105-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional image analysis techniques fail to determine the morphological changes astrocytes undergo following inflammation. Developing an automated segmentation workflow allowed us to extract morphological data of GFAP or ALDH1L1 positive objects. Using principal component analysis and random forests, we were able to determine the features most important for identifying whether an astrocyte was baseline or reactive. To further determine the changes different segmented cellular astrocyte components underwent (i.e., the body or process), we performed k‐means clustering. Multiple, well‐validated machine learning approaches allowed us to determine astrocytes undergo a region‐specific heterogenous morphological change following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of reactive astrogliosis by neuroanatomical assays represents a common experimental outcome for neuroanatomists. The literature demonstrates several conflicting results as to the accuracy of such measures. We posited that the diverging results within the neuroanatomy literature were due to suboptimal analytical workflows in addition to astrocyte regional heterogeneity. We therefore generated an automated segmentation workflow to extract features of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Family 1, Member L1 (ALDH1L1) labeled astrocytes with and without neuroinflammation. We achieved this by capturing multiplexed immunofluorescent confocal images of mouse brains treated with either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by implementation of our workflows. Using classical image analysis techniques focused on pixel intensity only, we were unable to identify differences between vehicle‐treated and LPS‐treated animals. However, when utilizing machine learning based algorithms, we were able to (1) accurately predict which objects were derived from GFAP or ALDH1L1 stained images indicating that GFAP and ALDH1L1 highlight distinct morphological aspects of astrocytes, (2) we could predict which neuroanatomical region the segmented GFAP or ALDH1L1 object had been derived from, indicating that morphological features of astrocytes change as a function of neuroanatomical location. (3) We discovered a statistically significant, albeit not highly accurate, prediction of which objects had come from LPS versus vehicle‐treated animals, indicating that although features exist capable of distinguishing LPS‐treated versus vehicle‐treated GFAP and ALDH1L1 segmented objects, that significant overlap between morphologies exists. We further determined that for most classification scenarios, non‐linear models were required for improved treatment class designations. We propose that unbiased automated image analysis techniques coupled with well‐validated machine learning tools represent highly useful models capable of providing insights into neuroanatomical assays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) of the amygdala plays an important role in the generation of emotional/motivational behavior and the consolidation of emotional memories. Activation of M1 cholinergic receptors (M1Rs) in the BNC is critical for memory consolidation. Previous receptor binding studies in the monkey amygdala demonstrated that the BNC has a high density of M1Rs, but did not have sufficient resolution to identify which neurons in the BNC expressed them. This was accomplished in the present immunohistochemical investigation using an antibody for the m1 receptor (m1R). Analysis of m1Rs in the monkey BNC using immunoperoxidase techniques revealed that their expression was very dense in the BNC, and suggested that virtually all of the pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) in all of the BNC nuclei were m1R‐immunoreactive (m1R+). This was confirmed with dual‐labeling immunofluorescence using staining for calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for BNC PNs. However, additional dual‐labeling studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were also m1R+. Moreover, the finding that 60% of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive neurons were m1R+ indicated that this IN subpopulation was the main GAD+ subpopulation exhibiting m1R expression. The cholinergic innervation of the amygdala is greatly reduced in Alzheimer’s disease and there is currently considerable interest in developing selective M1R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) to treat the symptoms. The results of the present study indicate that M1Rs in both PNs and INs in the primate BNC would be targeted by M1R PAMs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Defining vitamin D receptor expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9ce1ce57-6b0e-411a-a198-97d5c6122df2/cne25100-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this article, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (−) neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson's. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor‐α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CaVα2δ Autoimmune Encephalitis: A Novel Antibody and its Characteristics</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering novel antibody enables diagnosis and early treatment of the autoimmune encephalitis. We discovered a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterized the pathogenic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and CSF samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further process for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, antigen‐binding assay on antigen‐overexpressed cell line, and electrophysiology assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two patients had a novel antibody against Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the patients' antibody to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma, and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we found a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote the early diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis of single-cell genomics data presents several statistical challenges, and extensive efforts have been made to produce methods for the analysis of this data that impute missing values, address sampling issues and quantify and correct for noise. In spite of such efforts, no consensus on best practices has been established and all current approaches vary substantially based on the available data and empirical tests. The k-Nearest Neighbor Graph (kNN-G) is often used to infer the identities of, and relationships between, cells and is the basis of many widely used dimensionality-reduction and projection methods. The kNN-G has also been the basis for imputation methods using, &lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., neighbor averaging and graph diffusion. However, due to the lack of an agreed-upon optimal objective function for choosing hyperparameters, these methods tend to oversmooth data, thereby resulting in a loss of information with regard to cell identity and the specific gene-to-gene patterns underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the tuning of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods with a novel non-stochastic method for optimally preserving biologically relevant informative variance in single-cell data. The framework, &lt;i&gt;Denoising Expression data with a Weighted Affinity Kernel and Self-Supervision&lt;/i&gt; (DEWÄKSS), uses a self-supervised technique to tune its parameters. We demonstrate that denoising with optimal parameters selected by our objective function (i) is robust to preprocessing methods using data from established benchmarks, (ii) disentangles cellular identity and maintains robust clusters over dimension-reduction methods, (iii) maintains variance along several expression dimensions, unlike previous heuristic-based methods that tend to oversmooth data variance, and (iv) rarely involves diffusion but rather uses a fixed weighted kNN graph for denoising. Together, these findings provide a new understanding of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods. Code and example data for DEWÄKSS is available at https://gitlab.com/Xparx/dewakss/-/tree/Tjarnberg2020branch.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/967wFN1lsTg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Model based planners reflect on their model-free propensities</title>

Dual-reinforcement learning theory proposes behaviour is under the tutelage of a retrospective, value-caching, model-free (MF) system and a prospective-planning, model-based (MB), system. This architecture raises a question as to the degree to which, when devising a plan, a MB controller takes account of influences from its MF counterpart. We present evidence that such a sophisticated self-reflective MB planner incorporates an anticipation of the influences its own MF-proclivities exerts on the execution of its planned future actions. Using a novel bandit task, wherein subjects were periodically allowed to design their environment, we show that reward-assignments were constructed in a manner consistent with a MB system taking account of its MF propensities. Thus, in the task participants assigned higher rewards to bandits that were momentarily associated with stronger MF tendencies. Our findings have implications for a range of decision making domains that includes drug abuse, pre-commitment, and the tension between short and long-term decision horizons in economics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QxHdqkRen64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Lassa viral dynamics in non-human primates treated with favipiravir or ribavirin</title>

Lassa fever is an haemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). There is no vaccine approved against LASV and the only recommended antiviral treatment relies on ribavirin, despite limited evidence of efficacy. Recently, the nucleotide analogue favipiravir showed a high antiviral efficacy, with 100% survival obtained in an otherwise fully lethal non-human primate (NHP) model of Lassa fever. However the mechanism of action of the drug is not known and the absence of pharmacokinetic data limits the translation of these results to the human setting. Here we aimed to better understand the antiviral effect of favipiravir by developping the first mathematical model recapitulating Lassa viral dynamics and treatment. We analyzed the viral dynamics in 24 NHPs left untreated or treated with ribavirin or favipiravir, and we put the results in perspective with those obtained with the same drugs in the context of Ebola infection. Our model estimates favipiravir EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to 2.89 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g.mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much lower than what was found against Ebola virus. The main mechanism of action of favipiravir was to decrease virus infectivity, with an efficacy of 91% at the highest dose. Based on our knowledge acquired on the drug pharmacokinetics in humans, our model predicts that favipiravir doses larger than 1200 mg twice a day should have the capability to strongly reduce the production infectious virus and provide a milestone towards a future use in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7Iw8o7tTHjI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Phenomenological relations such as Ohm’s or Fourier’s law have a venerable history in physics but are still scarce in biology. This situation restrains predictive theory. Here, we build on bacterial “growth laws,” which capture physiological feedback between translation and cell growth, to construct a minimal biophysical model for the combined action of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Our model predicts drug interactions like antagonism or synergy solely from responses to individual drugs. We provide analytical results for limiting cases, which agree well with numerical results. We systematically refine the model by including direct physical interactions of different antibiotics on the ribosome. In a limiting case, our model provides a mechanistic underpinning for recent predictions of higher-order interactions that were derived using entropy maximization. We further refine the model to include the effects of antibiotics that mimic starvation and the presence of resistance genes. We describe the impact of a starvation-mimicking antibiotic on drug interactions analytically and verify it experimentally. Our extended model suggests a change in the type of drug interaction that depends on the strength of resistance, which challenges established rescaling paradigms. We experimentally show that the presence of unregulated resistance genes can lead to altered drug interaction, which agrees with the prediction of the model. While minimal, the model is readily adaptable and opens the door to predicting interactions of second and higher-order in a broad range of biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vLmQvfofd8M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

State-of-the-art rare variant association testing methods aggregate the contribution of rare variants in biologically relevant genomic regions to boost statistical power. However, testing single genes separately does not consider the complex interaction landscape of genes, nor the downstream effects of non-synonymous variants on protein structure and function. Here we present the NETwork Propagation-based Assessment of Genetic Events (NETPAGE), an integrative approach aimed at investigating the biological pathways through which rare variation results in complex disease phenotypes. We applied NETPAGE to sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), using whole-genome sequencing from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, as well as whole-exome sequencing from the AD Sequencing Project (ADSP). NETPAGE is based on network propagation, a framework that models information flow on a graph and simulates the percolation of genetic variation through tissue-specific gene interaction networks. The result of network propagation is a set of smoothed gene scores that can be tested for association with disease status through sparse regression. The application of NETPAGE to AD enabled the identification of a set of connected genes whose smoothed variation profile was robustly associated to case-control status, based on gene interactions in the hippocampus. Additionally, smoothed scores significantly correlated with risk of conversion to AD in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation of the core genes in two independent RNA-seq datasets, as well as significant enrichments in terms of gene sets with known connections to AD. We present a framework that enables enhanced genetic association testing for a wide range of traits, diseases, and sample sizes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aEcyLZvYtDc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Finding medications or vaccines that may decrease the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could potentially reduce transmission in the broader population. We developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential clinical and economic impact of reducing the infectious period duration. Simulation experiments found that reducing the average infectious period duration could avert a median of 442,852 [treating 25% of symptomatic cases, reducing by 0.5 days, reproductive number (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) 3.5, and starting treatment when 15% of the population has been exposed] to 44.4 million SARS-CoV-2 cases (treating 75% of all infected cases, reducing by 3.5 days, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 2.0). With R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 2.5, reducing the average infectious period duration by 0.5 days for 25% of symptomatic cases averted 1.4 million cases and 99,398 hospitalizations; increasing to 75% of symptomatic cases averted 2.8 million cases. At $500/person, treating 25% of symptomatic cases saved $209.5 billion (societal perspective). Further reducing the average infectious period duration by 3.5 days averted 7.4 million cases (treating 25% of symptomatic cases). Expanding treatment to 75% of all infected cases, including asymptomatic infections (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 2.5), averted 35.9 million cases and 4 million hospitalizations, saving $48.8 billion (societal perspective and starting treatment after 5% of the population has been exposed). Our study quantifies the potential effects of reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infectious period duration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J3v9-EJMPlo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dynamic bistable switches enhance robustness and accuracy of cell cycle transitions</title>

Bistability is a common mechanism to ensure robust and irreversible cell cycle transitions. Whenever biological parameters or external conditions change such that a threshold is crossed, the system abruptly switches between different cell cycle states. Experimental studies have uncovered mechanisms that can make the shape of the bistable response curve change dynamically in time. Here, we show how such a dynamically changing bistable switch can provide a cell with better control over the timing of cell cycle transitions. Moreover, cell cycle oscillations built on bistable switches are more robust when the bistability is modulated in time. Our results are not specific to cell cycle models and may apply to other bistable systems in which the bistable response curve is time-dependent.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bq7N1WcUu0Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; (Group A streptococcus; GAS) is an important human pathogen responsible for mild to severe, life-threatening infections. GAS expresses a wide range of virulence factors, including the M family proteins. The M proteins allow the bacteria to evade parts of the human immune defenses by triggering the formation of a dense coat of plasma proteins surrounding the bacteria, including IgGs. However, the molecular level details of the M1-IgG interaction have remained unclear. Here, we characterized the structure and dynamics of this interaction interface in human plasma on the surface of live bacteria using integrative structural biology, combining cross-linking mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that the primary interaction is formed between the S-domain of M1 and the conserved IgG Fc-domain. In addition, we show evidence for a so far uncharacterized interaction between the A-domain and the IgG Fc-domain. Both these interactions mimic the protein G-IgG interface of group C and G streptococcus. These findings underline a conserved scavenging mechanism used by GAS surface proteins that block the IgG-receptor (FcγR) to inhibit phagocytic killing. We additionally show that we can capture Fab-bound IgGs in a complex background and identify XLs between the constant region of the Fab-domain and certain regions of the M1 protein engaged in the Fab-mediated binding. Our results elucidate the M1-IgG interaction network involved in inhibition of phagocytosis and reveal important M1 peptides that can be further investigated as future vaccine targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oCo3qRV_amI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We introduce a hybrid two-dimensional multiscale model of angiogenesis, the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) migrate from a pre-existing vascular bed in response to local environmental cues and cell-cell interactions, to create a new vascular network. Recent experimental studies have highlighted a central role of cell rearrangements in the formation of angiogenic networks. Our model accounts for this phenomenon via the heterogeneous response of ECs to their microenvironment. These cell rearrangements, in turn, dynamically remodel the local environment. The model reproduces characteristic features of angiogenic sprouting that include branching, chemotactic sensitivity, the brush border effect, and cell mixing. These properties, rather than being hardwired into the model, emerge naturally from the gene expression patterns of individual cells. After calibrating and validating our model against experimental data, we use it to predict how the structure of the vascular network changes as the baseline gene expression levels of the VEGF-Delta-Notch pathway, and the composition of the extracellular environment, vary. In order to investigate the impact of cell rearrangements on the vascular network structure, we introduce the mixing measure, a scalar metric that quantifies cell mixing as the vascular network grows. We calculate the mixing measure for the simulated vascular networks generated by ECs of different lineages (wild type cells and mutant cells with impaired expression of a specific receptor). Our results show that the time evolution of the mixing measure is directly correlated to the generic features of the vascular branching pattern, thus, supporting the hypothesis that cell rearrangements play an essential role in sprouting angiogenesis. Furthermore, we predict that lower cell rearrangement leads to an imbalance between branching and sprout elongation. Since the computation of this statistic requires only individual cell trajectories, it can be computed for networks generated in biological experiments, making it a potential biomarker for pathological angiogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c6q6XzetUQY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Natural environments, like soils or the mammalian gut, frequently contain microbial consortia competing within a niche, wherein many species contain genetically encoded mechanisms of interspecies competition. Recent computational work suggests that physical structures in the environment can stabilize local competition between species that would otherwise be subject to competitive exclusion under isotropic conditions. Here we employ Lotka-Volterra models to show that interfacial competition localizes to physical structures, stabilizing competitive ecological networks of many species, even with significant differences in the strength of competitive interactions between species. Within a limited range of parameter space, we show that for stable communities the length-scale of physical structure inversely correlates with the width of the distribution of competitive fitness, such that physical environments with finer structure can sustain a broader spectrum of interspecific competition. These results highlight the potentially stabilizing effects of physical structure on microbial communities and lay groundwork for engineering structures that stabilize and/or select for diverse communities of ecological, medical, or industrial utility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eQisoTeAscY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Vertebrate behavior is strongly influenced by light. Light receptors, encoded by functional opsin proteins, are present inside the vertebrate brain and peripheral tissues. This expression feature is present from fishes to human and appears to be particularly prominent in diurnal vertebrates. Despite their conserved widespread occurrence, the nonvisual functions of opsins are still largely enigmatic. This is even more apparent when considering the high number of opsins. Teleosts possess around 40 opsin genes, present from young developmental stages to adulthood. Many of these opsins have been shown to function as light receptors. This raises the question of whether this large number might mainly reflect functional redundancy or rather maximally enables teleosts to optimally use the complex light information present under water. We focus on &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin1b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin2&lt;/i&gt;, c-opsins with ancestral-type sequence features, conserved across several vertebrate phyla, expressed with partly similar expression in non-rod, non-cone, non-retinal-ganglion-cell brain tissues and with a similar spectral sensitivity. The characterization of the single mutants revealed age- and light-dependent behavioral changes, as well as an impact on the levels of the preprohormone &lt;i&gt;sst1b&lt;/i&gt; and the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit &lt;i&gt;scn12aa&lt;/i&gt;. The amount of daytime rest is affected independently of the eyes, pineal organ, and circadian clock in &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin1b&lt;/i&gt; mutants. We further focused on daytime behavior and the molecular changes in &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin1b/2&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, and found that—despite their similar expression and spectral features—these opsins interact in part nonadditively. Specifically, double mutants complement molecular and behavioral phenotypes observed in single mutants in a partly age-dependent fashion. Our work provides a starting point to disentangle the highly complex interactions of vertebrate nonvisual opsins, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin&lt;/i&gt;-expressing cells together with other visual and nonvisual opsins provide detailed light information to the organism for behavioral fine-tuning. This work also provides a stepping stone to unravel how vertebrate species with conserved opsins, but living in different ecological niches, respond to similar light cues and how human-generated artificial light might impact on behavioral processes in natural environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/A5SlMH1vVBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tuber locations associated with infantile spasms map to a common brain network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26015?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 50% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex develop infantile spasms, a sudden‐onset epilepsy syndrome associated with poor neurological outcomes. While an increased burden of tubers confers an elevated risk of infantile spasms, it remains unknown whether some tuber locations confer higher risk than others. Here, we test whether tuber location and connectivity are associated with infantile spasms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We segmented tubers from 123 children with (n=74) and without (n=49) infantile spasms from a prospective observational cohort. We used voxel‐wise lesion symptom mapping to test for an association between spasms and tuber location. We then used lesion network mapping to test for an association between spasms and connectivity with tuber locations. Finally, we tested the discriminability of identified associations with logistic regression and cross validation as well as statistical mediation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuber locations associated with infantile spasms were heterogenous, and no single location was significantly associated with spasms. However, &amp;gt;95% of tuber locations associated with spasms were functionally connected to the globus pallidi and cerebellar vermis. These connections were specific compared to tubers in patients without spasms. Logistic regression found that globus pallidus connectivity was a stronger predictor of spasms (OR 1.96, 95%CI [1.10, 3.50], p=0.02) than tuber burden (OR 1.65, 95%CI [0.90, 3.04], p=0.11), with a mean ROC area under the curve of 0.73 (+/‐0.1) during repeated cross validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity between tuber locations and the bilateral globus pallidus is associated with infantile spasms. Our findings lend insight into spasm pathophysiology and may identify patients at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Shapley Value of Classifiers in Ensemble Games. (arXiv:2101.02153v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do we decide the fair value of individual classifiers in an ensemble
model? We introduce a new class of transferable utility cooperative games to
answer this question. The players in ensemble games are pre-trained binary
classifiers that collaborate in an ensemble to correctly label points from a
dataset. We design Troupe a scalable algorithm that designates payoffs to
individual models based on the Shapley value of those in the ensemble game. We
show that the approximate Shapley value of classifiers in these games is an
adequate measure for selecting a subgroup of highly predictive models. In
addition, we introduce the Shapley entropy a new metric to quantify the
heterogeneity of machine learning ensembles when it comes to model quality. We
analytically prove that our Shapley value approximation algorithm is accurate
and scales to large ensembles and big data. Experimental results on graph
classification tasks establish that Troupe gives precise estimates of the
Shapley value in ensemble games. We demonstrate that the Shapley value can be
used for pruning large ensembles, show that complex classifiers have a prime
role in correct and incorrect classification decisions, and provide evidence
that adversarial models receive a low valuation.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Can Transfer Neuroevolution Tractably Solve Your Differential Equations?. (arXiv:2101.01998v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01998</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01998</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces neuroevolution for solving differential equations. The
solution is obtained through optimizing a deep neural network whose loss
function is defined by the residual terms from the differential equations.
Recent studies have focused on learning such physics-informed neural networks
through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants, yet they face the
difficulty of obtaining an accurate solution due to optimization challenges. In
the context of solving differential equations, we are faced with the problem of
finding globally optimum parameters of the network, instead of being concerned
with out-of-sample generalization. SGD, which searches along a single gradient
direction, is prone to become trapped in local optima, so it may not be the
best approach here. In contrast, neuroevolution carries out a parallel
exploration of diverse solutions with the goal of circumventing local optima.
It could potentially find more accurate solutions with better optimized neural
networks. However, neuroevolution can be slow, raising tractability issues in
practice. With that in mind, a novel and computationally efficient transfer
neuroevolution algorithm is proposed in this paper. Our method is capable of
exploiting relevant experiential priors when solving a new problem, with
adaptation to protect against the risk of negative transfer. The algorithm is
applied on a variety of differential equations to empirically demonstrate that
transfer neuroevolution can indeed achieve better accuracy and faster
convergence than SGD. The experimental outcomes thus establish transfer
neuroevolution as a noteworthy approach for solving differential equations, one
that has never been studied in the past. Our work expands the resource of
available algorithms for optimizing physics-informed neural networks.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Weighted Ensemble-model and Network Analysis: A method to predict fluid intelligence via naturalistic functional connectivity. (arXiv:2101.01973v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01973</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01973</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Functional connectivity triggered by naturalistic stimulus (e.g.,
movies) and machine learning techniques provide a great insight in exploring
the brain functions such as fluid intelligence. However, functional
connectivity are considered to be multi-layered, while traditional machine
learning based on individual models not only are limited in performance, but
also fail to extract multi-dimensional and multi-layered information from brain
network. Methods: In this study, inspired by multi-layer brain network
structure, we propose a new method namely Weighted Ensemble-model and Network
Analysis, which combines the machine learning and graph theory for improved
fluid intelligence prediction. Firstly, functional connectivity analysis and
graphical theory were jointly employed. The functional connectivity and
graphical indices computed using the preprocessed fMRI data were then all fed
into auto-encoder parallelly for feature extraction to predict the fluid
intelligence. In order to improve the performance, tree regression and ridge
regression model were automatically stacked and fused with weighted values.
Finally, layers of auto-encoder were visualized to better illustrate the
connectome patterns, followed by the evaluation of the performance to justify
the mechanism of brain functions. Results: Our proposed methods achieved best
performance with 3.85 mean absolute deviation, 0.66 correlation coefficient and
0.42 R-squared coefficient, outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. It is
also worth noting that, the optimization of the biological pattern extraction
was automated though the auto-encoder algorithm. Conclusion: The proposed
method not only outperforming the state-of-the-art reports, but also able to
effectively capturing the biological patterns from functional connectivity
during naturalistic movies state for potential clinical explorations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been shown classically that combining two chaotic random walks can
yield an ordered(periodic) walk. Our aim in this paper is to find a quantum
analog for this rather counter-intuitive result. We study chaotic and periodic
nature of cyclic quantum walks and focus on an unique situation wherein a
periodic quantum walk on $3-$cycle graph is generated via a deterministic
combination of two chaotic quantum walks on the same graph. Our results will be
relevant in quantum cryptography and quantum chaos control.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reservoir computing is a popular approach to design recurrent neural
networks, due to its training simplicity and its approximation performance. The
recurrent part of these networks is not trained (e.g. via gradient descent),
making them appealing for analytical studies, raising the interest of a vast
community of researcher spanning from dynamical systems to neuroscience. It
emerges that, even in the simple linear case, the working principle of these
networks is not fully understood and the applied research is usually driven by
heuristics. A novel analysis of the dynamics of such networks is proposed,
which allows one to express the state evolution using the controllability
matrix. Such a matrix encodes salient characteristics of the network dynamics:
in particular, its rank can be used as an input-indepedent measure of the
memory of the network. Using the proposed approach, it is possible to compare
different architectures and explain why a cyclic topology achieves favourable
results.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09477</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore the phase diagram of approximation rates for deep neural networks
and prove several new theoretical results. In particular, we generalize the
existing result on the existence of deep discontinuous phase in ReLU networks
to functional classes of arbitrary positive smoothness, and identify the
boundary between the feasible and infeasible rates. Moreover, we show that all
networks with a piecewise polynomial activation function have the same phase
diagram. Next, we demonstrate that standard fully-connected architectures with
a fixed width independent of smoothness can adapt to smoothness and achieve
almost optimal rates. Finally, we consider deep networks with periodic
activations (&quot;deep Fourier expansion&quot;) and prove that they have very fast,
nearly exponential approximation rates, thanks to the emerging capability of
the network to implement efficient lookup operations.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation in Ischemic Stroke: Focus on MicroRNA-mediated Polarization of Microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.612439</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation is a major pathological event involved in the process of ischemic injury and repair. In particular, microglia play a dual role in neuroinflammation. During the acute phase of stroke onset, M2 microglia are the dominant phenotype and exert protective effects on neuronal cells, whereas permanent M1 microglia contribute to prolonged inflammation and are detrimental to brain tissue. Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) may have regulatory effects on microglia-associated inflammation. Thus, we briefly reviewed the dynamic response of microglia after a stroke and assessed how specific miRNAs affect the behavior of reactive microglia. We concluded that miRNAs may be useful novel therapeutic targets to improve stroke outcomes and modulate neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuroproteomics in Epilepsy: What Do We Know so Far?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsies are chronic neurological diseases that affect approximately 2% of the world population. In addition to being one of the most frequent neurological disorders, treatment for patients with epilepsy remains a challenge, because a proportion of patients do not respond to the antiseizure medications that are currently available. This results in a severe economic and social burden for patients, families, and the healthcare system. A characteristic common to all forms of epilepsy is the occurrence of epileptic seizures that are caused by abnormal neuronal discharges, leading to a clinical manifestation that is dependent on the affected brain region. It is generally accepted that an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition generates the synchronic electrical activity leading to seizures. However, it is still unclear how a normal neural circuit becomes susceptible to the generation of seizures or how epileptogenesis is induced. Herein, we review the results of recent proteomic studies applied to investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to epilepsies and how these findings may impact research and treatment for these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Hyperactivity Induced by Soluble Amyloid-β Oligomers in the Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.600084</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.600084</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo) start to accumulate in the human brain one to two decades before any clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are implicated in synapse loss, one of the best predictors of memory decline that characterize the illness. Cognitive impairment in AD was traditionally thought to result from a reduction in synaptic activity which ultimately induces neurodegeneration. More recent evidence indicates that in the early stages of AD synaptic failure is, at least partly, induced by neuronal hyperactivity rather than hypoactivity. Here, we review the growing body of evidence supporting the implication of soluble Aβo on the induction of neuronal hyperactivity in AD animal models, in vitro, and in humans. We then discuss the impact of Aβo-induced hyperactivity on memory performance, cell death, epileptiform activity, gamma oscillations, and slow wave activity. We provide an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are emerging to explain how Aβo induce neuronal hyperactivity. We conclude by providing an outlook on the impact of hyperactivity for the development of disease-modifying interventions at the onset of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Overloaded Adeno-Associated Virus as a Novel Gene Therapeutic Tool for Otoferlin-Related Deafness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder in humans. So far, rehabilitation of profoundly deaf subjects relies on direct stimulation of the auditory nerve through cochlear implants. However, in some forms of genetic hearing impairment, the organ of Corti is structurally intact and therapeutic replacement of the mutated gene could potentially restore near natural hearing. In the case of defects of the otoferlin gene (OTOF), such gene therapy is hindered by the size of the coding sequence (~6 kb) exceeding the cargo capacity (&amp;lt;5 kb) of the preferred viral vector, adeno-associated virus (AAV). Recently, a dual-AAV approach was used to partially restore hearing in deaf otoferlin knock-out (Otof-KO) mice. Here, we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the gene-therapeutic potential of naturally-occurring and newly-developed synthetic AAVs overloaded with the full-length Otof coding sequence. Upon early postnatal injection into the cochlea of Otof-KO mice, overloaded AAVs drove specific expression of otoferlin in ~30% of all IHCs, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labeling and polymerase chain reaction. Recordings of auditory brainstem responses and a behavioral assay demonstrated partial restoration of hearing. Together, our results suggest that viral gene therapy of DFNB9—using a single overloaded AAV vector—is indeed feasible, reducing the complexity of gene transfer compared to dual-AAV approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Induces Transient, Sequential Increases in Proliferation, Neuroblasts/Immature Neurons, and Cell Survival: A Time Course Study in the Male Mouse Dentate Gyrus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.612749</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.612749</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are prevalent worldwide. mTBIs can impair hippocampal-based functions such as memory and cause network hyperexcitability of the dentate gyrus (DG), a key entry point to hippocampal circuitry. One candidate for mediating mTBI-induced hippocampal cognitive and physiological dysfunction is injury-induced changes in the process of DG neurogenesis. There are conflicting results on how TBI impacts the process of DG neurogenesis; this is not surprising given that both the neurogenesis process and the post-injury period are dynamic, and that the quantification of neurogenesis varies widely in the literature. Even within the minority of TBI studies focusing specifically on mild injuries, there is disagreement about if and how mTBI changes the process of DG neurogenesis. Here we utilized a clinically relevant rodent model of mTBI (lateral fluid percussion injury, LFPI), gold-standard markers and quantification of the neurogenesis process, and three time points post-injury to generate a comprehensive picture of how mTBI affects adult hippocampal DG neurogenesis. Male C57BL/6J mice (6-8 weeks old) received either sham surgery or mTBI via LFPI. Proliferating cells, neuroblasts/immature neurons, and surviving cells were quantified via stereology in DG subregions (subgranular zone [SGZ], outer granule cell layer [oGCL], molecular layer, and hilus) at short-term (3 days post-injury, dpi), intermediate (7 dpi), and long-term (31 dpi) time points. The data show this model of mTBI induces transient, sequential increases in ipsilateral SGZ/GCL proliferating cells, neuroblasts/immature neurons, and surviving cells which is suggestive of mTBI-induced neurogenesis. In contrast to these ipsilateral hemisphere findings, measures in the contralateral hemisphere were not increased in key neurogenic DG subregions after LFPI. Our work in this mTBI model is in line with most literature on other and more severe models of TBI in showing TBI stimulates the process of DG neurogenesis. However, as our DG data in mTBI provide temporal, subregional, and neurogenesis-stage resolution, these data are important to consider in regard to the functional importance of TBI-induction of the neurogenesis process and future work assessing the potential of replacing and/or repairing DG neurons in the brain after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Characteristics of Epigenetic Clocks Across Blood and Brain Tissue in Older Women and Men</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.555307</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.555307</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic clocks are among the most promising biomarkers of aging. It is particularly important to establish biomarkers of brain aging to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. To advance application of epigenetic clocks—which were largely created with DNA methylation levels in blood samples—for use in brain, we need clearer evaluation of epigenetic clock behavior in brain, including direct comparisons of brain specimens with blood, a more accessible tissue for research. We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine three established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge clocks) and a newer clock, trained in cortical tissue. We calculated each clock in three different specimens: (1) antemortem CD4+ cells derived from blood (n = 41); (2) postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, n = 730); and (3) postmortem posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, n = 186), among older women and men, age 66–108 years at death. Across all clocks, epigenetic age calculated from blood and brain specimens was generally lower than chronologic age, although differences were smallest for the Cortical clock when calculated in the brain specimens. Nonetheless, we found that Pearson correlations of epigenetic to chronologic ages in brain specimens were generally reasonable for all clocks; correlations for the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks largely ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 (all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The Cortical clock outperformed the other clocks, reaching a correlation of 0.83 in the DLFPC (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for epigenetic vs. chronologic age. Nonetheless, epigenetic age was quite modestly correlated across blood and DLPFC in 41 participants with paired samples [Pearson r from 0.21 (p = 0.2) to 0.32 (p = 0.05)], indicating that broader research in neurodegeneration may benefit from clocks using CpG sites better conserved across blood and brain. Finally, in analyses stratified by sex, by pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, and by clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia, correlations of epigenetic to chronologic age remained consistently high across all groups. Future research in brain aging will benefit from epigenetic clocks constructed in brain specimens, including exploration of any advantages of focusing on CpG sites conserved across brain and other tissue types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dance on the Brain: Enhancing Intra- and Inter-Brain Synchrony</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.584312</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dance has traditionally been viewed from a Eurocentric perspective as a mode of self-expression that involves the human body moving through space, performed for the purposes of art, and viewed by an audience. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we synthesize findings from anthropology, sociology, psychology, dance pedagogy, and neuroscience to propose The Synchronicity Hypothesis of Dance, which states that humans dance to enhance both intra- and inter-brain synchrony. We outline a neurocentric definition of dance, which suggests that dance involves neurobehavioral processes in seven distinct areas including sensory, motor, cognitive, social, emotional, rhythmic, and creative. We explore The Synchronicity Hypothesis of Dance through several avenues. First, we examine evolutionary theories of dance, which suggest that dance drives interpersonal coordination. Second, we examine fundamental movement patterns, which emerge throughout development and are omnipresent across cultures of the world. Third, we examine how each of the seven neurobehaviors increases intra- and inter-brain synchrony. Fourth, we examine the neuroimaging literature on dance to identify the brain regions most involved in and affected by dance. The findings presented here support our hypothesis that we engage in dance for the purpose of intrinsic reward, which as a result of dance-induced increases in neural synchrony, leads to enhanced interpersonal coordination. This hypothesis suggests that dance may be helpful to repattern oscillatory activity, leading to clinical improvements in autism spectrum disorder and other disorders with oscillatory activity impairments. Finally, we offer suggestions for future directions and discuss the idea that our consciousness can be redefined not just as an individual process but as a shared experience that we can positively influence by dancing together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Comorbidity Between Math and Reading Problems: Is Phonological Processing a Mutual Factor?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.577304</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.577304</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a relationship between reading and math skills, as well as comorbidity between reading and math disorders. A mutual foundation for this comorbidity could be that the quality of phonological representations is important for both early reading and arithmetic. In this study, we examine this hypothesis in a sample traced longitudinally from preschool to first grade (N = 259). The results show that phonological awareness does not explain development in arithmetic, but that there is an indirect effect between phoneme awareness in preschool and arithmetic in first grade via phoneme awareness in first grade. This effect is, however, weak and restricted to verbal arithmetic and not arithmetic fluency. This finding is only partly in line with other studies, and a reason could be that this study more strongly controls for confounders and previous skills than other studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: An “Outside-In” and “Inside-Out” Consideration of Complement in the Multiple Sclerosis Brain: Lessons From Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600656</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600656</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The last 15 years have seen an explosion of new findings on the role of complement, a major arm of the immune system, in the central nervous system (CNS) compartment including contributions to cell migration, elimination of synapse during development, aberrant synapse pruning in neurologic disorders, damage to nerve cells in autoimmune diseases, and traumatic injury. Activation of the complement system in multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically thought to occur as part of a primary (auto)immune response from the periphery (the outside) against CNS antigens (the inside). However, evidence of local complement production from CNS-resident cells, intracellular complement functions, and the more recently discovered role of early complement components in shaping synaptic circuits in the absence of inflammation opens up the possibility that complement-related sequelae may start and finish within the brain itself. In this review, the complement system will be introduced, followed by evidence that implicates complement in shaping the developing, adult, and normal aging CNS as well as its contribution to pathology in neurodegenerative conditions. Discussion of data supporting “outside-in” vs. “inside-out” roles of complement in MS will be presented, concluded by thoughts on potential approaches to therapies targeting specific elements of the complement system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Fully-Immersive and Automated Virtual Reality System to Assess the Six Domains of Cognition: Protocol for a Feasibility Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.604670</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.604670</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Dementia is increasing in prevalence in aging populations. Current questionnaire-based cognitive assessments may not comprehensively assess cognitive function and real-time task-performance. Virtual reality (VR) technology has been used in cognitive assessments but existing systems have limited scope in evaluating all cognitive domains. We have developed a novel, fully-immersive VR system (CAVIRE: Cognitive Assessment by VIrtual REality), which incorporates automated audio-visual instructions. An automated scoring matrix to assess the six cognitive domains—perceptual-motor function, executive function, complex attention, social cognition, learning and memory, and language—is embedded in the CAVIRE system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of using the CAVIRE system to assess cognitive function of participants across different age groups from 35 to 84 years old. The secondary aims are to determine the CAVIRE performance-indices (completion time and scores) of the participants and to assess their acceptability toward the use of CAVIRE as a modality for cognitive assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and seventy-five participants will be assessed by CAVIRE at a primary care clinic in Singapore. They will be first assessed using questionnaires: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADLs), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). Those aged 65–84 years will be grouped into cognitively intact (n = 50, MoCA score ≥ 26) and cognitively impaired (n = 50, MoCA &amp;lt; 26). The CAVIRE performance-indices of cognitively healthy younger participants aged 35–64 years (n = 75) will serve as benchmark references. CAVIRE auto-computes the participant's performance-indices in 13 different segments. The tasks include domestic chores, memory, shopping, and social interactions. The proportion of participants who complete the entire VR assessment in each age group will be evaluated as feasibility indicators. The CAVIRE performance-indices will be compared across the different age groups. Feedback on the acceptability of the CAVIRE system will be collated and compared among the participants across the age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: CAVIRE is designed to assess the six domains of cognitive function using VR. The results of this feasibility study will provide insights for the implementation of the CAVIRE system as an alternative modality of cognitive assessment in the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a membrane channel implicated in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes via its ability to support release of ATP and other cellular metabolites for local intercellular signaling. However, to date, there has been no direct demonstration of large molecule permeation via the Panx1 channel itself, and thus the permselectivity of Panx1 for different molecules remains unknown. To address this, we expressed, purified and reconstituted Panx1 into proteoliposomes and demonstrated that channel activation by caspase cleavage yields a dye-permeable pore that favors flux of anionic, large-molecule permeants (up to ~1 kDa). Large cationic molecules can also permeate the channel, albeit at a much lower rate. We further show that Panx1 channels provide a molecular pathway for flux of ATP and other anionic (glutamate) and cationic signaling metabolites (spermidine). These results verify large molecule permeation directly through activated Panx1 channels that can support their many physiological roles.</description>

	<description>The NLRP1 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that is a potent activator of inflammation. Mouse NLRP1B can be activated through proteolytic cleavage by the bacterial Lethal Toxin (LeTx) protease, resulting in degradation of the N-terminal domains of NLRP1B and liberation of the bioactive C-terminal domain, which includes the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). However, natural pathogen-derived effectors that can activate human NLRP1 have remained unknown. Here, we use an evolutionary model to identify several proteases from diverse picornaviruses that cleave human NLRP1 within a rapidly evolving region of the protein, leading to host-specific and virus-specific activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome. Our work demonstrates that NLRP1 acts as a “tripwire” to recognize the enzymatic function of a wide range of viral proteases, and suggests that host mimicry of viral polyprotein cleavage sites can be an evolutionary strategy to activate a robust inflammatory immune response.</description>

	<title>eLife: Molecular basis for the adaptive evolution of environment sensing by H-NS proteins</title>

	<description>The DNA-binding protein H-NS is a pleiotropic gene regulator in gram-negative bacteria. Through its capacity to sense temperature and other environmental factors, H-NS allows pathogens like Salmonella to adapt their gene expression to their presence inside or outside warm-blooded hosts. To investigate how this sensing mechanism may have evolved to fit different bacterial lifestyles, we compared H-NS orthologs from bacteria that infect humans, plants, and insects, and from bacteria that live on a deep-sea hypothermal vent. The combination of biophysical characterization, high-resolution proton-less NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations revealed, at an atomistic level, how the same general mechanism was adapted to specific habitats and lifestyles. In particular, we demonstrate how environment-sensing characteristics arise from specifically positioned intra- or intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Our integrative approach clarified the exact modus operandi for H-NS–mediated environmental sensing and suggests that this sensing mechanism resulted from the exaptation of an ancestral protein feature.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroplasticity in N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/151bfa20-c8e3-43b3-9e6e-1d596bd57109/cne25094-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartic acid receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartic acid receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1, and the excitatory scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10–12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques, western blotting, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95, and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Axon‐myelin unit blistering as early event in MS normal appearing white matter.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26014?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;‐lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations which could implicate imbalance of axon‐myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from MS patients and non‐neurological/non‐MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS brains, we detected blister‐like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non‐neurological/non‐MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post‐translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The risks of using the chi-square periodogram to estimate the period of biological rhythms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael C. Tackenberg, Jacob J. Hughey&lt;/p&gt;

The chi-square periodogram (CSP), developed over 40 years ago, continues to be one of the most popular methods to estimate the period of circadian (circa 24-h) rhythms. Previous work has indicated the CSP is sometimes less accurate than other methods, but understanding of why and under what conditions remains incomplete. Using simulated rhythmic time-courses, we found that the CSP is prone to underestimating the period in a manner that depends on the true period and the length of the time-course. This underestimation bias is most severe in short time-courses (e.g., 3 days), but is also visible in longer simulated time-courses (e.g., 12 days) and in experimental time-courses of mouse wheel-running and ex vivo bioluminescence. We traced the source of the bias to discontinuities in the periodogram that are related to the number of time-points the CSP uses to calculate the observed variance for a given test period. By revising the calculation to avoid discontinuities, we developed a new version, the greedy CSP, that shows reduced bias and improved accuracy. Nonetheless, even the greedy CSP tended to be less accurate on our simulated time-courses than an alternative method, namely the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Thus, although our study describes a major improvement to a classic method, it also suggests that users should generally avoid the CSP when estimating the period of biological rhythms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GLnerg7E1a8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Phylogeographic inference allows reconstruction of past geographical spread of pathogens or living organisms by integrating genetic and geographic data. A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A4faYaa8IVQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Investigating metabolic functional capability of a human gut microbiome enables the quantification of microbiome changes, which can cause a phenotypic change of host physiology and disease. One possible way to estimate the functional capability of a microbial community is through inferring metagenomic content from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Genome-scale models (GEMs) can be used as scaffold for functional estimation analysis at a systematic level, however up to date, there is no integrative toolbox based on GEMs for uncovering metabolic functions. Here, we developed the MetGEMs (metagenome-scale models) toolbox, an open-source application for inferring metabolic functions from 16S rRNA gene sequences to facilitate the study of the human gut microbiome by the wider scientific community. The developed toolbox was validated using shotgun metagenomic data and shown to be superior in predicting functional composition in human clinical samples compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. Therefore, the MetGEMs toolbox was subsequently applied for annotating putative enzyme functions and metabolic routes related in human disease using atopic dermatitis as a case study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cvRxw_0L_cQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are prevalent in the eukaryotic proteome. Common functional roles of IDRs include forming flexible linkers or undergoing allosteric folding-upon-binding. Recent studies have suggested an additional functional role for IDRs: generating steric pressure on the plasma membrane during endocytosis, via molecular crowding. However, in order to accomplish useful functions, such crowding needs to be regulated in space (e.g., endocytic hotspots) and time (e.g., during vesicle formation). In this work, we explore binding-induced regulation of IDR steric volume. We simulate the IDRs of two proteins from Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to see if their conformational spaces are regulated via binding-induced expansion. Using Monte-Carlo computational modeling of excluded volumes, we generate large conformational ensembles (3 million) for the IDRs of Epsin and Eps15 and dock the conformers to the alpha subunit of Adaptor Protein 2 (AP2α), their CME binding partner. Our results show that as more molecules of AP2α are bound, the Epsin-derived ensemble shows a significant increase in global dimensions, measured as the radius of Gyration (R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) and the end-to-end distance (EED). Unlike Epsin, Eps15-derived conformers that permit AP2α binding at one motif were found to be more likely to accommodate binding of AP2α at other motifs, suggesting a tendency toward co-accessibility of binding motifs. Co-accessibility was not observed for any pair of binding motifs in Epsin. Thus, we speculate that the disordered regions of Epsin and Eps15 perform different roles during CME, with accessibility in Eps15 allowing it to act as a recruiter of AP2α molecules, while binding-induced expansion of the Epsin disordered region could impose steric pressure and remodel the plasma membrane during vesicle formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_Mks-JSRUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With an estimated $10.4 billion in medical costs and 31.4 million outpatient visits each year, influenza poses a serious burden of disease in the United States. To provide insights and advance warning into the spread of influenza, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs a challenge for forecasting weighted influenza-like illness (wILI) at the national and regional level. Many models produce independent forecasts for each geographical unit, ignoring the constraint that the national wILI is a weighted sum of regional wILI, where the weights correspond to the population size of the region. We propose a novel algorithm that transforms a set of independent forecast distributions to obey this constraint, which we refer to as probabilistically coherent. Enforcing probabilistic coherence led to an increase in forecast skill for 79% of the models we tested over multiple flu seasons, highlighting the importance of respecting the forecasting system’s geographical hierarchy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4BkC14wLJxg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To ensure genome stability, sexually reproducing organisms require that mating brings together exactly 2 haploid gametes and that meiosis occurs only in diploid zygotes. In the fission yeast &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;, fertilization triggers the Mei3-Pat1-Mei2 signaling cascade, which represses subsequent mating and initiates meiosis. Here, we establish a degron system to specifically degrade proteins postfusion and demonstrate that mating blocks not only safeguard zygote ploidy but also prevent lysis caused by aberrant fusion attempts. Using long-term imaging and flow-cytometry approaches, we identify previously unrecognized and independent roles for Mei3 and Mei2 in zygotes. We show that Mei3 promotes premeiotic S-phase independently of Mei2 and that cell cycle progression is both necessary and sufficient to reduce zygotic mating behaviors. Mei2 not only imposes the meiotic program and promotes the meiotic cycle, but also blocks mating behaviors independently of Mei3 and cell cycle progression. Thus, we find that fungi preserve zygote ploidy and survival by at least 2 mechanisms where the zygotic fate imposed by Mei2 and the cell cycle reentry triggered by Mei3 synergize to prevent zygotic mating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kthJfvLIOcg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ectoderm to mesoderm transition by down-regulation of actomyosin contractility</title>

Collective migration of cohesive tissues is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and is particularly well illustrated during gastrulation by the rapid and massive internalization of the mesoderm, which contrasts with the much more modest movements of the ectoderm. In the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryo, the differences in morphogenetic capabilities of ectoderm and mesoderm can be connected to the intrinsic motility of individual cells, very low for ectoderm, highly for mesoderm. Surprisingly, we find that these seemingly deep differences can be accounted for simply by differences in Rho-kinases (Rock)-dependent actomyosin contractility. We show that Rock inhibition is sufficient to rapidly unleash motility in the ectoderm and confer it with mesoderm-like properties. In the mesoderm, this motility is dependent on 2 negative regulators of RhoA, the small GTPase Rnd1 and the RhoGAP Shirin/Dlc2/ArhGAP37. Both are absolutely essential for gastrulation. At the cellular and tissue level, the 2 regulators show overlapping yet distinct functions. They both contribute to decrease cortical tension and confer motility, but Shirin tends to increase tissue fluidity and stimulate dispersion, while Rnd1 tends to favor more compact collective migration. Thus, each is able to contribute to a specific property of the migratory behavior of the mesoderm. We propose that the “ectoderm to mesoderm transition” is a prototypic case of collective migration driven by a down-regulation of cellular tension, without the need for the complex changes traditionally associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_ck0PJhOhs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor increases matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression in microglia and promotes microglia‐mediated glioma progression&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c07dfb8c-7e6d-4932-9a36-cd1f24bb6d1a/jnr24768-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor derived from glioma cells upregulate matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression on microglia, which in turn promote glioma progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is released by glioma cells and promotes tumor growth. We have previously found that GDNF released from the tumor cells is a chemoattractant for microglial cells, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Here we show that GDNF increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP14 expression in cultured microglial cells from mixed sexes of neonatal mice. The GDNF‐induced microglial MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation is mediated by GDNF family receptor alpha 1 receptors and dependent on p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling. In organotypic brain slices, GDNF promotes the growth of glioma and this effect depends on the presence of microglia. We also previously found that MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation can be mediated by Toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling and here we demonstrate that GDNF increases the expression of TLR1 and TLR2. In conclusion, GDNF promotes the pro‐tumorigenic phenotype of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Gamma‐protocadherin localization at the synapse is associated with parameters of synaptic maturation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d4dec52-fa7a-4524-86ef-fdb42363748e/cne25102-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial section immuno‐electron microscopy of gamma protocadherins (Pcdh‐γs), a subset of clustered protocadherins, at synapses in CA1. We characterized synaptic diameter and perforation status for synapses labeled with antibodies to Pcdh‐γs and found that they were larger with more frequent perforations. Results were confirmed by light level imaging of immunolabeled synapses. The results suggest that clustered protocadherins may mediate a late event in synaptic development. Bar = 500 nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a family of ~60 cadherin‐like proteins (divided into subclasses α, β, and γ) that regulate dendrite morphology and neural connectivity. Their expression is controlled through epigenetic regulation at a gene cluster encoding the molecules. During neural development, Pcdhs mediate dendrite self‐avoidance in some neuronal types through an uncharacterized anti‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs are also important for dendritic complexity in cortical neurons likely through a pro‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs have also been postulated to participate in synaptogenesis and connectivity. Some synaptic defects were noted in knockout animals, including synaptic number and physiology, but the role of these molecules in synaptic development is not understood. The effect of Pcdh knockout on dendritic patterning may present a confound to studying synaptogenesis. We showed previously that Pcdh‐γs are highly enriched in intracellular compartments in dendrites and spines with localization at only a few synaptic clefts. To gain insight into how Pcdh‐γs might affect synapses, we compared synapses that harbored Pcdh‐γs versus those that did not for parameters of synaptic maturation including pre‐ and postsynaptic size, postsynaptic perforations, and spine morphology by light microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons and by serial section immuno‐electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1. In mature neurons, synapses immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs were larger in diameter with more frequent perforations. Analysis of spines in cultured neurons revealed that mushroom spines were more frequently immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs at their tips than thin spines. These results suggest that Pcdh‐γ function at the synapse may be related to promotion of synaptic maturation and stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Model Reduction Captures Stochastic Gamma Oscillations on Low-Dimensional Manifolds. (arXiv:2101.01699v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gamma frequency oscillations (25-140 Hz), observed in the neural activities
within many brain regions, have long been regarded as a physiological basis
underlying many brain functions, such as memory and attention. Among numerous
theoretical and computational modeling studies, gamma oscillations have been
found in biologically realistic spiking network models of the primary visual
cortex. However, due to its high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity, it is
generally difficult to perform detailed theoretical analysis of the emergent
gamma dynamics. Here we propose a suite of Markovian model reduction methods
with varying levels of complexity and applied it to spiking network models
exhibiting heterogeneous dynamical regimes, ranging from homogeneous firing to
strong synchrony in the gamma band. The reduced models not only successfully
reproduce gamma band oscillations in the full model, but also exhibit the same
dynamical features as we vary parameters. Most remarkably, the invariant
measure of the coarse-grained Markov process reveals a two-dimensional surface
in state space upon which the gamma dynamics mainly resides. Our results
suggest that the statistical features of gamma oscillations strongly depend on
the subthreshold neuronal distributions. Because of the generality of the
Markovian assumptions, our dimensional reduction methods offer a powerful
toolbox for theoretical examinations of many other complex cortical
spatio-temporal behaviors observed in both neurophysiological experiments and
numerical simulations.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Constrained optimisation of preliminary spacecraft configurations under the design-for-demise paradigm. (arXiv:2101.01558v1 [eess.SY])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01558</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01558</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, the interest towards the implementation of
design-for-demise measures has increased steadily. Most mid-sized satellites
currently launched and already in orbit fail to comply with the casualty risk
threshold of 0.0001. Therefore, satellites manufacturers and mission operators
need to perform a disposal through a controlled re-entry, which has a higher
cost and increased complexity. Through the design-for-demise paradigm, this
additional cost and complexity can be removed as the spacecraft is directly
compliant with the casualty risk regulations. However, building a spacecraft
such that most of its parts will demise may lead to designs that are more
vulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the
mission. In fact, the requirements connected to the demisability and the
survivability are in general competing. Given this competing nature, trade-off
solutions can be found, which favour the implementation of design-for-demise
measures while still maintaining the spacecraft resilient to space debris
impacts. A multi-objective optimisation framework has been developed by the
authors in previous works. The framework's objective is to find preliminary
design solutions considering the competing nature of the demisability and the
survivability of a spacecraft since the early stages of the mission design. In
this way, a more integrated design can be achieved. The present work focuses on
the improvement of the multi-objective optimisation framework by including
constraints. The paper shows the application of the constrained optimisation to
two relevant examples: the optimisation of a tank assembly and the optimisation
of a typical satellite configuration.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a non-substance dualism theory, following Heisenberg: The world
consists of both ontologically real possibilities that do not obey Aristotle's
Law of the Excluded Middle, and ontologically real Actuals that do o0bey the
Law of the Excluded Middle. This quantum approach solves five issues in quantum
mechanics and numerous puzzles about the mind-brain relationship. It raises the
possibility that some aspects of mind are non-local, and that mind plays an
active role in the physical world. We present supporting evidence.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: On the Control of Attentional Processes in Vision. (arXiv:2101.01533v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01533</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01533</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study of attentional processing in vision has a long and deep history.
Recently, several papers have presented insightful perspectives into how the
coordination of multiple attentional functions in the brain might occur. These
begin with experimental observations and the authors propose structures,
processes, and computations that might explain those observations. Here, we
consider a perspective that past works have not, as a complementary approach to
the experimentally-grounded ones. We approach the same problem as past authors
but from the other end of the computational spectrum, from the problem nature,
as Marr's Computational Level would prescribe. What problem must the brain
solve when orchestrating attentional processes in order to successfully
complete one of the myriad possible visuospatial tasks at which we as humans
excel? The hope, of course, is for the approaches to eventually meet and thus
form a complete theory, but this is likely not soon. We make the first steps
towards this by addressing the necessity of attentional control, examining the
breadth and computational difficulty of the visuospatial and attentional tasks
seen in human behavior, and suggesting a sketch of how attentional control
might arise in the brain. The key conclusions of this paper are that an
executive controller is necessary for human attentional function in vision, and
that there is a 'first principles' computational approach to its understanding
that is complementary to the previous approaches that focus on modelling or
learning from experimental observations directly.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Increased Excitability and Heightened Magnitude of Long-Term Potentiation at Hippocampal CA3–CA1 Synapses in a Mouse Model of Neonatal Hyperoxia Exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.609903</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.609903</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preterm infants exposed to supraphysiological oxygen (hyperoxia) during the neonatal period have hippocampal atrophy and cognitive dysfunction later in childhood and as adolescents. Previously, we reported that 14-week-old adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as newborns had spatial memory deficits and hippocampal shrinkage, findings that mirror those of human adolescents who were born preterm. The area CA1 region of the hippocampus that is crucial for spatial learning and memory is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia exposure on hippocampal CA3–CA1 synaptic function. Male and female C57BL/6J mouse pups were continuously exposed to either 85% normobaric oxygen or air between postnatal days 2–14. Hippocampal slice electrophysiology at CA3–CA1 synapses was then performed at 14 weeks of age. We observed that hyperoxia exposed mice have heightened strength of basal synaptic transmission measured in input-output curves, increased fiber volley amplitude indicating increased axonal excitability, and heightened LTP magnitude at CA3–CA1 synapses, likely a consequence of increased postsynaptic depolarization during tetanus. These data demonstrate that supraphysiological oxygen exposure during the critical neonatal developmental period leads to pathologically heightened CA3–CA1 synaptic function during early adulthood which may contribute to hippocampal shrinkage and learning and memory deficits we previously reported. Furthermore, these results will help shed light on the consequences of hyperoxia exposure on the development of hippocampal synaptic circuit abnormalities that could be contributing to cognitive deficits in children born preterm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Iron Content in Deep Gray Matter as a Function of Age Using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping: A Multicenter Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.607705</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.607705</link>
	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of resolution on iron content using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); to verify the consistency of QSM across field strengths and manufacturers in evaluating the iron content of deep gray matter (DGM) of the human brain using subjects from multiple sites; and to establish a susceptibility baseline as a function of age for each DGM structure using both a global and regional iron analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data from 623 healthy adults, ranging from 20 to 90 years old, were collected across 3 sites using gradient echo imaging on one 1.5 Tesla and two 3.0 Tesla MR scanners. Eight subcortical gray matter nuclei were semi-automatically segmented using a full-width half maximum threshold-based analysis of the QSM data. Mean susceptibility, volume and total iron content with age correlations were evaluated for each measured structure for both the whole-region and RII (high iron content regions) analysis. For the purpose of studying the effect of resolution on QSM, a digitized model of the brain was applied.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean susceptibilities of the caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP) and putamen (PUT) were not significantly affected by changing the slice thickness from 0.5 to 3 mm. But for small structures, the susceptibility was reduced by 10% for 2 mm thick slices. For global analysis, the mean susceptibility correlated positively with age for the CN, PUT, red nucleus (RN), substantia nigra (SN), and dentate nucleus (DN). There was a negative correlation with age in the thalamus (THA). The volumes of most nuclei were negatively correlated with age. Apart from the GP, THA, and pulvinar thalamus (PT), all the other structures showed an increasing total iron content despite the reductions in volume with age. For the RII regional high iron content analysis, mean susceptibility in most of the structures was moderately to strongly correlated with age. Similar to the global analysis, apart from the GP, THA, and PT, all structures showed an increasing total iron content.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A reasonable estimate for age-related iron behavior can be obtained from a large cross site, cross manufacturer set of data when high enough resolutions are used. These estimates can be used for correcting for age related iron changes when studying diseases like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other iron related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cortical Thickness in Migraine: A Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.600423</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.600423</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical thickness (CTh) via surface-based morphometry analysis is a popular method to characterize brain morphometry. Many studies have been performed to investigate CTh abnormalities in migraine. However, the results from these studies were not consistent and even conflicting. These divergent results hinder us to obtain a clear picture of brain morphometry regarding CTh alterations in migraine. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is a promising technique to quantitatively pool individual neuroimaging studies to identify consistent brain areas involved. Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and SinoMed) and other sources (bioRxiv and reference lists of relevant articles and reviews) were systematically searched for studies that compared regional CTh differences between patients with migraine and healthy controls (HCs) up to May 15, 2020. A CBMA was performed using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images approach. In total, we identified 16 studies with 17 datasets reported that were eligible for the CBMA. The 17 datasets included 872 patients with migraine (average sample size 51.3, mean age 39.6 years, 721 females) and 949 HCs (average sample size 59.3, mean age 44.2 years, 680 females). The CBMA detected no statistically significant consistency of CTh alterations in patients with migraine relative to HCs. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis verified this result to be robust. Metaregression analyses revealed that this CBMA result was not confounded by age, gender, aura, attack frequency per month, and illness duration. Our CBMA adds to the evidence of the replication crisis in neuroimaging research that is increasingly recognized. Many potential confounders, such as underpowered sample size, heterogeneous patient selection criteria, and differences in imaging collection and methodology, may contribute to the inconsistencies of CTh alterations in migraine, which merit attention before planning future research on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Differential Level of RXFP3 Expression in Dopaminergic Neurons Within the Arcuate Nucleus, Dorsomedial Hypothalamus and Ventral Tegmental Area of RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.594818</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;RXFP3 (relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor) is the cognate G-protein-coupled receptor for the neuropeptide, relaxin-3. RXFP3 is expressed widely throughout the brain, including the hypothalamus, where it has been shown to modulate feeding behavior and neuroendocrine activity in rodents. In order to better characterize its potential mechanisms of action, this study determined whether RXFP3 is expressed by dopaminergic neurons within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), in addition to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurons that express RXFP3 were visualized in coronal brain sections from RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice, which express the tdTomato fluorophore within RXFP3-positive cells, and dopaminergic neurons in these areas were visualized by simultaneous immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Approximately 20% of ARC neurons containing TH-IR coexpressed tdTomato fluorescence, suggesting that RXFP3 can influence the dopamine pathway from the ARC to the pituitary gland that controls prolactin release. The ability of prolactin to reduce leptin sensitivity and increase food consumption therefore represents a potential mechanism by which RXFP3 activation influences feeding. A similar proportion of DMH neurons containing TH-IR expressed RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence, consistent with a possible RXFP3-mediated regulation of stress and neuroendocrine circuits. In contrast, RXFP3 was barely detected within the VTA. TdTomato signal was absent from the ARC and DMH in sections from Rosa26-tdTomato mice, suggesting that the cells identified in RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice expressed authentic RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence. Together, these findings identify potential hypothalamic mechanisms through which RXFP3 influences neuroendocrine control of metabolism, and further highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting RXFP3 in feeding-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decoding Three Different Preference Levels of Consumers Using Convolutional Neural Network: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597864</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597864</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study decodes consumers' preference levels using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in neuromarketing. The classification accuracy in neuromarketing is a critical factor in evaluating the intentions of the consumers. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is utilized as a neuroimaging modality to measure the cerebral hemodynamic responses. In this study, a specific decoding structure, called CNN-based fNIRS-data analysis, was designed to achieve a high classification accuracy. Compared to other methods, the automated characteristics, constant training of the dataset, and learning efficiency of the proposed method are the main advantages. The experimental procedure required eight healthy participants (four female and four male) to view commercial advertisement videos of different durations (15, 30, and 60 s). The cerebral hemodynamic responses of the participants were measured. To compare the preference classification performances, CNN was utilized to extract the most common features, including the mean, peak, variance, kurtosis, and skewness. Considering three video durations, the average classification accuracies of 15, 30, and 60 s videos were 84.3, 87.9, and 86.4%, respectively. Among them, the classification accuracy of 87.9% for 30 s videos was the highest. The average classification accuracies of three preferences in females and males were 86.2 and 86.3%, respectively, showing no difference in each group. By comparing the classification performances in three different combinations (like vs. so-so, like vs. dislike, and so-so vs. dislike) between two groups, male participants were observed to have targeted preferences for commercial advertising, and the classification performance 88.4% between “like” vs. “dislike” out of three categories was the highest. Finally, pairwise classification performance are shown as follows: For female, 86.1% (like vs. so-so), 87.4% (like vs. dislike), 85.2% (so-so vs. dislike), and for male 85.7, 88.4, 85.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortical Tracking of the Speech Envelope in Logopenic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597694</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597694</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) is a neurodegenerative language disorder primarily characterized by impaired phonological processing. Sentence repetition and comprehension deficits are observed in lvPPA and linked to impaired phonological working memory, but recent evidence also implicates impaired speech perception. Currently, neural encoding of the speech envelope, which forms the scaffolding for perception, is not clearly understood in lvPPA. We leveraged recent analytical advances in electrophysiology to examine speech envelope encoding in lvPPA. We assessed cortical tracking of the speech envelope and in-task comprehension of two spoken narratives in individuals with lvPPA (n = 10) and age-matched (n = 10) controls. Despite markedly reduced narrative comprehension relative to controls, individuals with lvPPA had increased cortical tracking of the speech envelope in theta oscillations, which track low-level features (e.g., syllables), but not delta oscillations, which track speech units that unfold across a longer time scale (e.g., words, phrases, prosody). This neural signature was highly correlated across narratives. Results indicate an increased reliance on acoustic cues during speech encoding. This may reflect inefficient encoding of bottom-up speech cues, likely as a consequence of dysfunctional temporoparietal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Thematic Integration Impairments in Primary Progressive Aphasia: Evidence From Eye-Tracking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.587594</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.587594</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a degenerative disease affecting language while leaving other cognitive facilities relatively unscathed. The agrammatic subtype of PPA (PPA-G) is characterized by agrammatic language production with impaired comprehension of noncanonical filler-gap syntactic structures, such as object-relatives [e.g., The sandwich that the girl ate (gap) was tasty], in which the filler (the sandwich) is displaced from the object position within the relative clause to a position preceding both the verb and the agent (the girl) and is replaced by a gap linked with the filler. One hypothesis suggests that the observed deficits of these structures reflect impaired thematic integration, including impaired prediction of the thematic role of the filler and impaired thematic integration at the gap, but spared structure building (i.e., creation of the gap). In the current study, we examined the on-line comprehension of object-relative and subject-relative clauses in healthy controls and individuals with agrammatic and logopenic PPA using eye-tracking. Eye-movement patterns in canonical subject-relative clause structures were essentially spared in both PPA groups. In contrast, eye-movement patterns in noncanonical object-relative clauses revealed delayed thematic prediction in both agrammatic and logopenic PPA, on-time structure building (i.e., gap-filling) in both groups, and abnormal thematic integration in agrammatic, but not logopenic, PPA. We argue that these results are consistent with the hypothesis that agrammatic comprehension deficits reflect impaired thematic integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: WGEVIA: A Graph Level Embedding Method for Microcircuit Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional microcircuits are useful for studying interactions among neural dynamics of neighboring neurons during cognition and emotion. A functional microcircuit is a group of neurons that are spatially close, and that exhibit synchronized neural activities. For computational analysis, functional microcircuits are represented by graphs, which pose special challenges when applied as input to machine learning algorithms. Graph embedding, which involves the conversion of graph data into low dimensional vector spaces, is a general method for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we discuss limitations of conventional graph embedding methods that make them ill-suited to the study of functional microcircuits. We then develop a novel graph embedding framework, called Weighted Graph Embedding with Vertex Identity Awareness (WGEVIA), that overcomes these limitations. Additionally, we introduce a dataset, called the five vertices dataset, that helps in assessing how well graph embedding methods are suited to functional microcircuit analysis. We demonstrate the utility of WGEVIA through extensive experiments involving real and simulated microcircuit data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Calcium Imaging and the Curse of Negativity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.607391</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.607391</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The imaging of neuronal activity using calcium indicators has become a staple of modern neuroscience. However, without ground truths, there is a real risk of missing a significant portion of the real responses. Here, we show that a common assumption, the non-negativity of the neuronal responses as detected by calcium indicators, biases all levels of the frequently used analytical methods for these data. From the extraction of meaningful fluorescence changes to spike inference and the analysis of inferred spikes, each step risks missing real responses because of the assumption of non-negativity. We first show that negative deviations from baseline can exist in calcium imaging of neuronal activity. Then, we use simulated data to test three popular algorithms for image analysis, CaImAn, suite2p, and CellSort, finding that suite2p may be the best suited to large datasets. We also tested the spike inference algorithms included in CaImAn, suite2p, and Cellsort, as well as the dedicated inference algorithms MLspike and CASCADE, and found each to have limitations in dealing with inhibited neurons. Among these spike inference algorithms, FOOPSI, from CaImAn, performed the best on inhibited neurons, but even this algorithm inferred spurious spikes upon the return of the fluorescence signal to baseline. As such, new approaches will be needed before spikes can be sensitively and accurately inferred from calcium data in inhibited neurons. We further suggest avoiding data analysis approaches that, by assuming non-negativity, ignore inhibited responses. Instead, we suggest a first exploratory step, using k-means or PCA for example, to detect whether meaningful negative deviations are present. Taking these steps will ensure that inhibition, as well as excitation, is detected in calcium imaging datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common in the elderly population. Obstructive sleep apnea that may cause significant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid and T-tau and/or P-tau protein levels is often identified as a risk factor for development of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms of AD are still not fully understood, a hypothesis associating OSA with AD has been already proposed. In this systematic mini-review, we first discuss the recent findings supporting the association of OSA with an increased risk of AD and then provide evidence suggesting the positive effect of OSA treatment on a reduced risk of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: The Hippo pathway controls myofibril assembly and muscle fiber growth by regulating sarcomeric gene expression</title>

	<description>Skeletal muscles are composed of gigantic cells called muscle fibers, packed with force-producing myofibrils. During development the size of individual muscle fibers must dramatically enlarge to match with skeletal growth. How muscle growth is coordinated with growth of the contractile apparatus is not understood. Here, we use the large &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight muscles to mechanistically decipher how muscle fiber growth is controlled. We find that regulated activity of core members of the Hippo pathway is required to support flight muscle growth. Interestingly, we identify Dlg5 and Slmap as regulators of the STRIPAK phosphatase, which negatively regulates Hippo to enable post-mitotic muscle growth. Mechanistically, we show that the Hippo pathway controls timing and levels of sarcomeric gene expression during development and thus regulates the key components that physically mediate muscle growth. Since Dlg5, STRIPAK and the Hippo pathway are conserved a similar mechanism may contribute to muscle or cardiomyocyte growth in humans.</description>

	<description>A fundamental question in biology is how morphogenesis integrates the multitude of processes that act at different scales, ranging from the molecular control of gene expression to cellular coordination in a tissue. Using machine-learning-based digital image analysis, we generated a three-dimensional atlas of ovule development in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, enabling the quantitative spatio-temporal analysis of cellular and gene expression patterns with cell and tissue resolution. We discovered novel morphological manifestations of ovule polarity, a new mode of cell layer formation, and previously unrecognized subepidermal cell populations that initiate ovule curvature. The data suggest an irregular cellular build-up of &lt;i&gt;WUSCHEL&lt;/i&gt; expression in the primordium and new functions for &lt;i&gt;INNER NO OUTER&lt;/i&gt; in restricting nucellar cell proliferation and the organization of the interior chalaza. Our work demonstrates the analytical power of a three-dimensional digital representation when studying the morphogenesis of an organ of complex architecture that eventually consists of 1900 cells.</description>

	<description>Although mRNAs are localized in the processes of excitatory neurons, it is still unclear whether interneurons also localize a large population of mRNAs. In addition, the variability in the localized mRNA population within and between cell-types is unknown. Here we describe the unbiased transcriptomic characterization of the subcellular compartments of hundreds of single neurons. We separately profiled the dendritic and somatic transcriptomes of individual rat hippocampal neurons and investigated mRNA abundances in the soma and dendrites of single glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We found that, like their excitatory counterparts, interneurons contain a rich repertoire of ~4000 mRNAs. We observed more cell type-specific features among somatic transcriptomes than their associated dendritic transcriptomes. Finally, using cell-type specific metabolic labelling of isolated neurites, we demonstrated that the processes of Glutamatergic and, notably, GABAergic neurons were capable of local translation, suggesting mRNA localization and local translation is a general property of neurons.</description>

	<title>eLife: The origins and consequences of UPF1 variants in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma</title>

	<description>Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) is an aggressive cancer whose mutational origins are poorly understood. An early study reported high-frequency somatic mutations affecting UPF1, a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor, in PASC, but subsequent studies did not observe these lesions. The corresponding controversy about whether &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are important contributors to PASC has been exacerbated by a paucity of functional studies. Here, we modeled two &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in human and mouse cells to find no significant effects on pancreatic cancer growth, acquisition of adenosquamous features, &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; splicing, UPF1 protein, or NMD efficiency. We subsequently discovered that 45% of &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; mutations reportedly present in PASCs are identical to standing genetic variants in the human population, suggesting that they may be non-pathogenic inherited variants rather than pathogenic mutations. Our data suggest that &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; is not a common functional driver of PASC and motivate further attempts to understand the genetic origins of these malignancies.</description>

	<description>Cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs) shuttle at distance and fertilize pre-metastatic niches facilitating subsequent seeding by tumor cells. However, the link between EV secretion mechanisms and their capacity to form pre-metastatic niches remains obscure. Using mouse models, we show that GTPases of the Ral family control, through the phospholipase D1, multi-vesicular bodies homeostasis and tune the biogenesis and secretion of pro-metastatic EVs. Importantly, EVs from RalA or RalB depleted cells have limited organotropic capacities &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and are less efficient in promoting metastasis. RalA and RalB reduce the EV levels of the adhesion molecule MCAM/CD146, which favors EV-mediated metastasis by allowing EVs targeting to the lungs. Finally, RalA, RalB and MCAM/CD146, are factors of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Altogether, our study identifies RalGTPases as central molecules linking the mechanisms of EVs secretion and cargo loading to their capacity to disseminate and induce pre-metastatic niches in a CD146 dependent manner.</description>

	<description>The hydrothermal vent tubeworm &lt;i&gt;Riftia pachyptila&lt;/i&gt; hosts a single 16S rRNA phylotype of intracellular sulfur-oxidizing symbionts, which vary considerably in cell morphology and exhibit a remarkable degree of physiological diversity and redundancy, even in the same host. To elucidate whether multiple metabolic routes are employed in the same cells or rather in distinct symbiont subpopulations, we enriched symbionts according to cell size by density gradient centrifugation. Metaproteomic analysis, microscopy, and flow cytometry strongly suggest that &lt;i&gt;Riftia&lt;/i&gt; symbiont cells of different sizes represent metabolically dissimilar stages of a physiological differentiation process: While small symbionts actively divide and may establish cellular symbiont-host interaction, large symbionts apparently do not divide, but still replicate DNA, leading to DNA endoreduplication. Moreover, in large symbionts, carbon fixation and biomass production seem to be metabolic priorities. We propose that this division of labor between smaller and larger symbionts benefits the productivity of the symbiosis as a whole.</description>

Chemical graph generators are software packages to generate computer representations of chemical structures adhering to certain boundary conditions. Their development is a research topic of cheminformatics. Chemical graph generators are used in areas such as virtual library generation in drug design, in molecular design with specified properties, called inverse QSAR/QSPR, as well as in organic synthesis design, retrosynthesis or in systems for computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE). CASE systems again have regained interest for the structure elucidation of unknowns in computational metabolomics, a current area of computational biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lsVjWfKyaMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Acute Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol prompts rapid changes in cannabinoid CB1 receptor immunolabeling and subcellular structure in CA1 hippocampus of young adult male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fbcf6e6d-8902-428e-9ea0-aa94ae67d23e/cne25098-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute exposure to Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) significantly decreases cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor density at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria. Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria. CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (arrows), inhibitory terminals (ter, red shading), mitochondria (m, purple shading), dendrites (blue shading), dendritic spines (sp, blue shading). Scale bars = 500 nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however, it remains unclear whether (1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and (2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria, and astrocytes. The percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria. Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria, and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Forebrain projection neurons target functionally diverse respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/942dd782-5e14-4e9b-afcd-0d151e8193c9/cne25091-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data imply that (a) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; (b) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; and (c) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing, and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the forebrain 12–14 days postinjection. Overall, our data reveal that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex networks have complete subgraphs such as nodes, edges, triangles,
etc., referred to as cliques of different orders. Notably, cavities consisting
of higher-order cliques have been found playing an important role in brain
functions. Since searching for the maximum clique in a large network is an
NP-complete problem, we propose using k-core decomposition to determine the
computability of a given network subject to limited computing resources. For a
computable network, we design a search algorithm for finding cliques of
different orders, which also provides the Euler characteristic number. Then, we
compute the Betti number by using the ranks of the boundary matrices of
adjacent cliques. Furthermore, we design an optimized algorithm for finding
cavities of different orders. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the neuronal
network of C. elegans in one dataset, and find its all cliques and some
cavities of different orders therein, providing a basis for further
mathematical analysis and computation of the structure and function of the C.
elegans neuronal network.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Regularization-based Continual Learning for Anomaly Detection in Discrete Manufacturing. (arXiv:2101.00509v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00509</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00509</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The early and robust detection of anomalies occurring in discrete
manufacturing processes allows operators to prevent harm, e.g. defects in
production machinery or products. While current approaches for data-driven
anomaly detection provide good results on the exact processes they were trained
on, they often lack the ability to flexibly adapt to changes, e.g. in products.
Continual learning promises such flexibility, allowing for an automatic
adaption of previously learnt knowledge to new tasks. Therefore, this article
discusses different continual learning approaches from the group of
regularization strategies, which are implemented, evaluated and compared based
on a real industrial metal forming dataset.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An expression for the group delay of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model in response to
low amplitude input is obtained by linearisation of the cubic term of the
voltage equation around its stable fixed-point. It is found that a negative
group delay exists for low frequencies, indicating that the evolution of slowly
fluctuating signals are anticipated by the voltage dynamics. The effects of the
group delay for different types of signals are shown numerically for the
non-linearised FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and some observations on the signal
aspects that are anticipated are stated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bayesian learning is a powerful learning framework which combines the
external information of the data (background information) with the internal
information (training data) in a logically consistent way in inference and
prediction. By Bayes rule, the external information (prior distribution) and
the internal information (training data likelihood) are combined coherently,
and the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive (marginal)
distribution obtained by Bayes rule summarize the total information needed in
the inference and prediction, respectively. In this paper, we study the
Bayesian framework of the Tensor Network from two perspective. First, we
introduce the prior distribution to the weights in the Tensor Network and
predict the labels of the new observations by the posterior predictive
(marginal) distribution. Since the intractability of the parameter integral in
the normalization constant computation, we approximate the posterior predictive
distribution by Laplace approximation and obtain the out-product approximation
of the hessian matrix of the posterior distribution of the Tensor Network
model. Second, to estimate the parameters of the stationary mode, we propose a
stable initialization trick to accelerate the inference process by which the
Tensor Network can converge to the stationary path more efficiently and stably
with gradient descent method. We verify our work on the MNIST, Phishing Website
and Breast Cancer data set. We study the Bayesian properties of the Bayesian
Tensor Network by visualizing the parameters of the model and the decision
boundaries in the two dimensional synthetic data set. For a application
purpose, our work can reduce the overfitting and improve the performance of
normal Tensor Network model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stress and driving are a dangerous combination which can lead to crashes, as
evidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that involve stress.
Motivated by the need to address the significant costs of driver stress, it is
essential to build a practical system that can classify driver stress level
with high accuracy. However, the performance of an accurate driving stress
levels classification system depends on hyperparameter optimization choices
such as data segmentation (windowing hyperparameters). The configuration
setting of hyperparameters, which has an enormous impact on the system
performance, are typically hand-tuned while evaluating the algorithm. This
tuning process is time consuming and often depends on personal experience.
There are also no generic optimal values for hyperparameters values. In this
work, we propose a meta-heuristic approach to support automated hyperparameter
optimization and provide a real-time driver stress detection system. This is
the first systematic study of optimizing windowing hyperparameters based on
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal in the domain of driving safety. Our approach is
to propose a framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to
select an optimal/near optimal windowing hyperparameters values. The
performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets: a public
dataset (DRIVEDB dataset) and our collected dataset using an advanced
simulator. DRIVEDB dataset was collected in a real time driving scenario, and
our dataset was collected using an advanced driving simulator in the control
environment. We demonstrate that optimising the windowing hyperparameters
yields significant improvement in terms of accuracy. The most accurate built
model applied to the public dataset and our dataset, based on the selected
windowing hyperparameters, achieved 92.12% and 77.78% accuracy, respectively.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: The growing topology of the C. elegans connectome. (arXiv:2101.00065v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Probing the developing neural circuitry in Caenorhabditis elegans has
enhanced our understanding of nervous systems. The C. elegans connectome, like
those of other species, is characterized by a rich club of densely connected
neurons embedded within a small-world architecture. This organization of
neuronal connections, captured by quantitative network statistics, provides
insight into the system's capacity to perform integrative computations. Yet
these network measures are limited in their ability to detect weakly connected
motifs, such as topological cavities, that may support the systems capacity to
perform segregated computations. We address this limitation by using persistent
homology to track the evolution of topological cavities in the growing C.
elegans connectome throughout neural development, and assess the degree to
which the growing connectomes topology is resistant to biological noise. We
show that the developing connectome topology is both relatively robust to
changes in neuron birth times and not captured by similar growth models.
Additionally, we quantify the consequence of a neurons specific birth time and
ask if this metric tracks other biological properties of neurons. Our results
suggest that the connectomes growing topology is a robust feature of the
developing connectome that is distinct from other network properties, and that
the growing topology is particularly sensitive to the exact birth times of a
small set of predominantly motor neurons. By utilizing novel measurements that
track biological features, we anticipate that our study will be helpful in the
construction of more accurate models of neuronal development in C. elegans

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Toward Real-World BCI: CCSPNet, A Compact Subject-Independent Motor Imagery Framework. (arXiv:2012.13567v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13567</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13567</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) requires a complete data
gathering, training, and calibration phase for each user before it can be used.
This preliminary phase is time-consuming and should be done under the
supervision of technical experts commonly in laboratories for the BCI to
function properly. In recent years, a number of subject-independent (SI) BCIs
have been developed. However, there are many problems preventing them from
being used in real-world BCI applications. A lower accuracy than the
subject-dependent (SD) approach and a relatively high run-time of models with a
large number of model parameters are the most important ones. Therefore, a
real-world BCI application would greatly benefit from a compact
subject-independent BCI framework, ready to use immediately after the user puts
it on, and suitable for low-power edge-computing and applications in the
emerging area of internet of things (IoT). We propose a novel
subject-independent BCI framework named CCSPNet (Convolutional Common Spatial
Pattern Network) that is trained on the motor imagery (MI) paradigm of a
large-scale EEG signals database consisting of 400 trials for every 54 subjects
performing two-class hand-movement MI tasks. The proposed framework applies a
wavelet kernel convolutional neural network (WKCNN) and a temporal
convolutional neural network (TCNN) in order to represent and extract the
diverse frequency behavior and spectral patterns of EEG signals. The
convolutional layers outputs go through a CSP algorithm for class
discrimination and spatial feature extraction. The number of CSP features is
reduced by a dense neural network, and the final class label is determined by
an LDA. The final SD and SI classification accuracies of the proposed framework
match the best results obtained on the largest motor-imagery dataset present in
the BCI literature, with 99.993 percent fewer model parameters.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Fast whole-brain imaging of seizures in zebrafish larvae by two-photon light sheet microscopy. (arXiv:2012.09660v2 [q-bio.QM] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09660</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09660</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deciphering the workings of a brain (and its alterations due to pathologies
and disorders) requires real-time mapping of the activity of all neurons.
Recently, this formidable task has been brought into reach by the
implementation of light sheet fluorescence (LSF) microscopy on the transparent
zebrafish larva, a simple yet representative model of the vertebrate brain.
This application is however hindered by the use of visible light for
fluorescence excitation, inducing unwanted visual stimulation that can only be
partially overcome resorting to complex excitation geometries. On the other
hand, two-photon (2P) LSF microscopy, owing to the use of invisible infra-red
illumination, enables volumetric imaging of neuronal activity avoiding
undesirable visual stimulation. However, due to the low efficiency of the 2P
absorption process, the imaging speed of this technique is typically limited (~
1 Hz) by the signal to noise ratio achievable without sample photodamage. Here
we describe a custom-made 2P LSF microscope that overcomes this limit, being
specifically designed to perform whole-brain cellular-resolution calcium
imaging in zebrafish larvae quintuplicating previous volumetric acquisition
frequency (5 Hz). [...] We employed this system to investigate, in real-time on
a brain-wide scale, the onset and propagation of acute seizures, as induced by
the convulsant drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), avoiding detrimental visual
stimulation on a highly susceptible system such as an epileptic brain. [...] In
conclusion, the presented 2P LSF microscope design affords high spatio-temporal
resolution while avoiding visual stimuli and allows unprecedented access to
whole zebrafish brain epileptic dynamics.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem revisited. (arXiv:2007.15884v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15884</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15884</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a longstanding debate whether the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
theorem can explain the use of more than one hidden layer in neural networks.
The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation decomposes a multivariate function into an
interior and an outer function and therefore has indeed a similar structure as
a neural network with two hidden layers. But there are distinctive differences.
One of the main obstacles is that the outer function depends on the represented
function and can be wildly varying even if the represented function is smooth.
We derive modifications of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation that transfer
smoothness properties of the represented function to the outer function and can
be well approximated by ReLU networks. It appears that instead of two hidden
layers, a more natural interpretation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
is that of a deep neural network where most of the layers are required to
approximate the interior function.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: RT3D: Achieving Real-Time Execution of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks on Mobile Devices. (arXiv:2007.09835v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09835</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mobile devices are becoming an important carrier for deep learning tasks, as
they are being equipped with powerful, high-end mobile CPUs and GPUs. However,
it is still a challenging task to execute 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) targeting for real-time performance, besides high inference accuracy.
The reason is more complex model structure and higher model dimensionality
overwhelm the available computation/storage resources on mobile devices. A
natural way may be turning to deep learning weight pruning techniques. However,
the direct generalization of existing 2D CNN weight pruning methods to 3D CNNs
is not ideal for fully exploiting mobile parallelism while achieving high
inference accuracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes RT3D, a model compression and mobile acceleration
framework for 3D CNNs, seamlessly integrating neural network weight pruning and
compiler code generation techniques. We propose and investigate two structured
sparsity schemes i.e., the vanilla structured sparsity and kernel group
structured (KGS) sparsity that are mobile acceleration friendly. The vanilla
sparsity removes whole kernel groups, while KGS sparsity is a more fine-grained
structured sparsity that enjoys higher flexibility while exploiting full
on-device parallelism. We propose a reweighted regularization pruning algorithm
to achieve the proposed sparsity schemes. The inference time speedup due to
sparsity is approaching the pruning rate of the whole model FLOPs (floating
point operations). RT3D demonstrates up to 29.1$\times$ speedup in end-to-end
inference time comparing with current mobile frameworks supporting 3D CNNs,
with moderate 1%-1.5% accuracy loss. The end-to-end inference time for 16 video
frames could be within 150 ms, when executing representative C3D and R(2+1)D
models on a cellphone. For the first time, real-time execution of 3D CNNs is
achieved on off-the-shelf mobiles.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bridging the Gaps Between Residual Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks and Visual Cortex. (arXiv:1604.03640v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03640</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We discuss relations between Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) and the primate visual cortex. We begin with the observation
that a special type of shallow RNN is exactly equivalent to a very deep ResNet
with weight sharing among the layers. A direct implementation of such a RNN,
although having orders of magnitude fewer parameters, leads to a performance
similar to the corresponding ResNet. We propose 1) a generalization of both RNN
and ResNet architectures and 2) the conjecture that a class of moderately deep
RNNs is a biologically-plausible model of the ventral stream in visual cortex.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architectures by testing them on the
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet dataset.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Improvements in Bladder Function Following Activity-Based Recovery Training With Epidural Stimulation After Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in profound neurologic impairment with widespread deficits in sensorimotor and autonomic systems. Voluntary and autonomic control of bladder function is disrupted resulting in possible detrusor overactivity, low compliance, and uncoordinated bladder and external urethral sphincter contractions impairing storage and/or voiding. Conservative treatments managing neurogenic bladder post-injury, such as oral pharmacotherapy and catheterization, are important components of urological surveillance and clinical care. However, as urinary complications continue to impact long-term morbidity in this population, additional therapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are needed that aim to improve function by targeting the recovery of underlying impairments. Several human and animal studies, including our previously published reports, have documented gains in bladder function due to activity-based recovery strategies, such as locomotor training. Furthermore, epidural stimulation of the spinal cord (scES) combined with intense activity-based recovery training has been shown to produce volitional lower extremity movement, standing, as well as improve the regulation of cardiovascular function. In our center, several participants anecdotally reported improvements in bladder function as a result of training with epidural stimulation configured for motor systems. Thus, in this study, the effects of activity-based recovery training in combination with scES were tested on bladder function, resulting in improvements in overall bladder storage parameters relative to a control cohort (no intervention). However, elevated blood pressure elicited during bladder distention, characteristic of autonomic dysreflexia, was not attenuated with training. We then examined, in a separate, large cross-sectional cohort, the interaction between detrusor pressure and blood pressure at maximum capacity, and found that the functional relationship between urinary bladder distention and blood pressure regulation is disrupted. Regardless of one’s bladder emptying method (indwelling suprapubic catheter vs. intermittent catheterization), autonomic instability can play a critical role in the ability to improve bladder storage, with SCI enhancing the vesico-vascular reflex. These results support the role of intersystem stimulation, integrating scES for both bladder and cardiovascular function to further improve bladder storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in developmental neuroscience is identifying the local regulatory mechanisms that control neurite and synaptic refinement over large brain volumes. Innovative molecular techniques and high-resolution imaging tools are beginning to reshape our view of how local protein translation in subcellular compartments drives axonal, dendritic, and synaptic development and plasticity. Here we review recent progress in three areas of neurite and synaptic study in situ—compartment-specific transcriptomics/translatomics, targeted proteomics, and super-resolution imaging analysis of synaptic organization and development. We discuss synergies between sequencing and imaging techniques for the discovery and validation of local molecular signaling mechanisms regulating synaptic development, plasticity, and maintenance in circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Calcium Sensors STIM1 and STIM2 Regulate Different Calcium Functions in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.573714</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are growing indications for the involvement of calcium stores in the plastic properties of neurons and particularly in dendritic spines of central neurons. The store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels are assumed to be activated by the calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule (STIM)which leads to activation of its associated Orai channel. There are two STIM species, and the differential role of the two in SOCE is not entirely clear. In the present study, we were able to distinguish between transfected STIM1, which is more mobile primarily in young neurons, and STIM2 which is less mobile and more prominent in older neurons in culture. STIM1 mobility is associated with spontaneous calcium sparks, local transient rise in cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and in the formation and elongation of dendritic filopodia/spines. In contrast, STIM2 is associated with older neurons, where it is mobile and moves into dendritic spines primarily when cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; levels are reduced, apparently to activate resident Orai channels. These results highlight a role for STIM1 in the regulation of [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuations associated with the formation of dendritic spines or filopodia in the developing neuron, whereas STIM2 is associated with the maintenance of calcium entry into stores in the adult neuron.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Ndfip1 Prevents Rotenone-Induced Neurotoxicity and Upregulation of α-Synuclein in SH-SY5Y Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nedd4 family interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) is an adaptor of Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligases. Experimental results showed that Ndfip1 had a potential neuroprotective effect in neurology diseases. However, the neuroprotective effect and the underlying mechanisms of Ndfip1 in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we explored the neuroprotective effect of Ndfip1 against mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone in a human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line and further elucidated its possible underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that rotenone could induce the up-regulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of Ndfip1 decreased at 24 h after rotenone treatment. Further study showed that high expression of Ndfip1 could protect SH-SY5Y cells against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and antagonize the rotenone-induced increase in α-syn protein levels. In addition, high expression of Ndfip1 inhibited rotenone-induced increase in the protein levels of caspase-3 and decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Further study showed that Ndfip1 did not affect the protein expression of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), while antagonized the increase in protein levels of P62 and ferritin L caused by rotenone. Our findings provide specific identification of Ndfip1 proteins to inhibit the increase of α-syn in rotenone-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Ndfip1 might be a new theoretical drug target for the prevention and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Enrichment and Correlation Analysis of Serum miRNAs in Comorbidity Between Arnold-Chiari and Tourette Syndrome Contribute to Clarify Their Molecular Bases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.608355</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to its rarity, coupled to a multifactorial and very heterogeneous nature, the molecular etiology of Arnold-Chiari (AC) syndrome remains almost totally unknown. Its relationship with other neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome (TS) is also undetermined. The rare comorbid status between both disorders (ACTS) complicates the framework of diagnosis and negatively affects the patients' quality of life. In this exploratory study, we aimed to identify serum microRNA expression profiles as molecular fingerprints for AC, TS, and ACTS, by using a high-throughput approach. For this aim, 10 AC patients, 11 ACTS patients, 6 TS patients, and 8 unaffected controls (NC) were recruited. Nine miRNAs resulted significantly differentially expressed (DE): let-7b-5p (upregulated in ACTS vs. TS); miR-21-5p (upregulated in ACTS vs. AC; downregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-23a-3p (upregulated in TS vs. NCs; downregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-25-3p (upregulated in AC vs. TS and NCs; downregulated in ACTS vs. AC); miR-93-5p (upregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-130a-3p (downregulated in ACTS and TS vs. NCs); miR-144-3p (downregulated in ACTS vs. AC; upregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-222-3p (upregulated in ACTS vs. NCs); miR-451a (upregulated in AC vs. TS and NCs; in ACTS vs. NCs). Altered expression of miRNAs was statistically correlated to neuroimaging and neuropsychological anomalies. Furthermore, computational analyses indicated that DE miRNAs are involved in AC and TS pathomechanisms. Finally, we propose the dysregulation of the miRNA set as a potential molecular tool for supporting the current diagnosis of AC, TS, and ACTS by using liquid biopsies, in an unbiased and non-invasive way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Electrical Characterisation of Aδ-Fibres Based on Human in vivo Electrostimulation Threshold</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of small fibres is gaining attention in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetes mellitus, and pain research. However, it is still challenging to characterise the electrical characteristics of axons in small fibres (Aδ and C fibres). In particular, in vitro measurement for human Aδ-fibre is difficult due to the presence of myelin and ethical reason. In this study, we investigate the in vivo electrical characteristics of the human Aδ-fibre to derive strength–duration (S–D) curves from the measurement. The Aδ-fibres are stimulated using coaxial planar electrodes with intraepidermal needle tip. For human volunteer experiments, the S–D curve of Aδ-fibre is obtained in terms of injected electrical current. With the computational analysis, the standard deviation of the S–D curve is mostly attributed to the thickness of the stratum corneum and depth of the needle tip, in addition to the fibre thickness. Then, we derive electrical parameters of the axon in the Aδ-fibre based on a conventional fibre model. The parameters derived here would be important in exploring the optimal stimulation condition of Aδ-fibres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurofeedback of Alpha Activity on Memory in Healthy Participants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.562360</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.562360</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neurofeedback training (NFT) has recently been proposed as a valuable technique for cognitive enhancement and psychiatric amelioration. However, effect of NFT of alpha activity on memory is controversial. The current study analyzed previous works in terms of randomized and blinded analyses, training paradigms, and participant characteristics to validate the efficacy of alpha NFT on memory in a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: A systematic meta-analysis of studies with randomized controlled trials was performed to explore the effect of alpha NFT on working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) in a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1999, to November 30, 2019. Previous studies were evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB). A meta-analysis calculating absolute weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) using random-effects models was employed. Heterogeneity was estimated using I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics. Funnel plots and Egger's test were performed to evaluate the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixteen studies with 217 healthy participants in the control group and 210 participants in the alpha group met the eligibility criteria. Alpha NFT studies with WM measures presented little publication bias (P = 0.116), and 5 of 7 domains in the Cochrane RoB exhibited a low risk of bias. The overall effect size from 14 WM studies was 0.56 (95% CI 0.31–0.81, P &amp;lt; 0.0001; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 28%). Six EM studies exhibited an effect size of 0.77 (95% CI 0.06–1.49, P = 0.03; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 77%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Meta-analysis results suggest that alpha NFT seems to have a positive effect on the WM and EM of healthy participants. Future efforts should focus on the neurophysiological mechanisms of alpha NFT in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Performance Analysis With Different Types of Visual Stimuli in a BCI-Based Speller Under an RSVP Paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems enable an alternative communication channel for severely-motor disabled patients to interact with their environment using no muscular movements. In recent years, the importance of research into non-gaze dependent brain-computer interface paradigms has been increasing, in contrast to the most frequently studied BCI-based speller paradigm (i.e., row-column presentation, RCP). Several visual modifications that have already been validated under the RCP paradigm for communication purposes have not been validated under the most extended non-gaze dependent rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Thus, in the present study, three different sets of stimuli were assessed under RSVP, with the following communication features: white letters (WL), famous faces (FF), neutral pictures (NP). Eleven healthy subjects participated in this experiment, in which the subjects had to go through a calibration phase, an online phase and, finally, a subjective questionnaire completion phase. The results showed that the FF and NP stimuli promoted better performance in the calibration and online phases, being slightly better in the FF paradigm. Regarding the subjective questionnaires, again both FF and NP were preferred by the participants in contrast to the WL stimuli, but this time the NP stimuli scored slightly higher. These findings suggest that the use of FF and NP for RSVP-based spellers could be beneficial to increase information transfer rate in comparison to the most frequently used letter-based stimuli and could represent a promising communication system for individuals with altered ocular-motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: On the Validity of Neural Mass Models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.581040</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling the dynamics of neural masses is a common approach in the study of neural populations. Various models have been proven useful to describe a plenitude of empirical observations including self-sustained local oscillations and patterns of distant synchronization. We discuss the extent to which mass models really resemble the mean dynamics of a neural population. In particular, we question the validity of neural mass models if the population under study comprises a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are densely (inter-)connected. Starting from a network of noisy leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we formulated two different population dynamics that both fall into the category of seminal Freeman neural mass models. The derivations contained several mean-field assumptions and time scale separation(s) between membrane and synapse dynamics. Our comparison of these neural mass models with the averaged dynamics of the population reveals bounds in the fraction of excitatory/inhibitory neuron as well as overall network degree for a mass model to provide adequate estimates. For substantial parameter ranges, our models fail to mimic the neural network's dynamics proper, be that in de-synchronized or in (high-frequency) synchronized states. Only around the onset of low-frequency synchronization our models provide proper estimates of the mean potential dynamics. While this shows their potential for, e.g., studying resting state dynamics obtained by encephalography with focus on the transition region, we must accept that predicting the more general dynamic outcome of a neural network via its mass dynamics requires great care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Study on Arrhythmia via ECG Signal Classification Using the Convolutional Neural Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death today. The current identification method of the diseases is analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a medical monitoring technology recording cardiac activity. Unfortunately, looking for experts to analyze a large amount of ECG data consumes too many medical resources. Therefore, the method of identifying ECG characteristics based on machine learning has gradually become prevalent. However, there are some drawbacks to these typical methods, requiring manual feature recognition, complex models, and long training time. This paper proposes a robust and efficient 12-layer deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network on classifying the five micro-classes of heartbeat types in the MIT- BIH Arrhythmia database. The five types of heartbeat features are classified, and wavelet self-adaptive threshold denoising method is used in the experiments. Compared with BP neural network, random forest, and other CNN networks, the results show that the model proposed in this paper has better performance in accuracy, sensitivity, robustness, and anti-noise capability. Its accurate classification effectively saves medical resources, which has a positive effect on clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Light Sheet Microscopy Using FITC-Albumin Followed by Immunohistochemistry of the Same Rehydrated Brains Reveals Ischemic Brain Injury and Early Microvascular Remodeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.625513</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the visualization of cerebral microvessels was hampered by the fact that only short segments of vessels could be evaluated in brain sections by histochemistry. These limitations have been overcome by light sheet microscopy, which allows the 3D analysis of microvasculature in cleared brains. A major limitation of light sheet microscopy is that antibodies do not sufficiently penetrate cleared brains. We herein describe a technique of reverse clearing and rehydration, which after microvascular network analysis allows brain sectioning and immunohistochemistry employing a broad set of antibodies. Performing light sheet microscopy on brains of mice exposed to intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we show that in the early phase of microvascular remodeling branching point density was markedly reduced, more strongly than microvascular length. Brain infarcts in light sheet microscopy were sharply demarcated by their autofluorescence signal, closely corresponding to brain infarcts revealed by Nissl staining. Neuronal survival, leukocyte infiltration, and astrocytic reactivity could be evaluated by immunohistochemistry in rehydrated brains, as shown in direct comparisons with non-cleared brains. Immunohistochemistry revealed microthrombi in ischemic microvessels that were likely responsible for the marked branching point loss. The balance between microvascular thrombosis and remodeling warrants further studies at later time-points after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Altered Weibull Degree Distribution in Resting-State Functional Brain Networks Is Associated With Cognitive Decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The topological organization of human brain networks can be mathematically characterized by the connectivity degree distribution of network nodes. However, there is no clear consensus on whether the topological structure of brain networks follows a power law or other probability distributions, and whether it is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we employed resting-state functional MRI and graph theory approaches to investigate the fitting of degree distributions of the whole-brain functional networks and seven subnetworks in healthy subjects and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), i.e., the prodromal stage of AD, and whether they are altered and correlated with cognitive performance in patients. Forty-one elderly cognitively healthy controls and 30 aMCI subjects were included. We constructed functional connectivity matrices among brain voxels and examined nodal degree distributions that were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation. In the whole-brain networks and all functional subnetworks, the connectivity degree distributions were fitted better by the Weibull distribution [f(x)~x&lt;sup&gt;(β−1)&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;(−λx&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;] than power law or power law with exponential cutoff. Compared with the healthy control group, the aMCI group showed lower Weibull β parameters (shape factor) in both the whole-brain networks and all seven subnetworks (false-discovery rate-corrected, p &amp;lt; 0.05). These decreases of the Weibull β parameters in the whole-brain networks and all subnetworks except for ventral attention were associated with reduced cognitive performance in individuals with aMCI. Thus, we provided a short-tailed model to capture intrinsic connectivity structure of the human brain functional networks in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Ca2+ signaling driving pacemaker activity in submucosal interstitial cells of Cajal in the murine colon</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64099</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64099</link>
	<description>Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) generate pacemaker activity responsible for phasic contractions in colonic segmentation and peristalsis. ICC along the submucosal border (ICC-SM) contribute to mixing and more complex patterns of colonic motility. We show the complex patterns of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in ICC-SM and the relationship between ICC-SM Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients and activation of SMCs using optogenetic tools. ICC-SM displayed rhythmic firing of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients ~15 cpm and paced adjacent SMCs. The majority of spontaneous activity occurred in regular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients clusters (CTCs) that propagated through the network. CTCs were organized and dependent upon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances, L- and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Removal of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from the external solution abolished CTCs. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release mechanisms reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients but did not block CTCs. These data reveal how colonic pacemaker ICC-SM exhibit complex Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; firing patterns and drive smooth muscle activity and overall colonic contractions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Checkpoint inhibition of origin firing prevents inappropriate replication outside of S-phase</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63589</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63589</link>
	<description>Checkpoints maintain the order of cell cycle events during DNA damage or incomplete replication. How the checkpoint response is tailored to different phases of the cell cycle remains poorly understood. The S-phase checkpoint for example results in the slowing of replication, which in budding yeast occurs by Rad53-dependent inhibition of the initiation factors Sld3 and Dbf4. Despite this, we show here that Rad53 phosphorylates both of these substrates throughout the cell cycle at the same sites as in S-phase, suggesting roles for this pathway beyond S-phase. Indeed, we show that Rad53-dependent inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 limits re-replication in G2/M, preventing gene amplification. In addition, we show that inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 in G1 prevents premature initiation at all origins at the G1/S transition. This study redefines the scope of the 'S-phase checkpoint' with implications for understanding checkpoint function in cancers that lack cell cycle controls.</description>

	<title>eLife: Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection</title>

	<description>COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. T cells play a key role in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected cells and facilitating the selection of virus-specific antibodies. However neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T cell clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</description>

	<title>eLife: Pituitary stem cells produce paracrine WNT signals to control the expansion of their descendant progenitor cells</title>

	<description>In response to physiological demand, the pituitary gland generates new hormone-secreting cells from committed progenitor cells throughout life. It remains unclear to what extent pituitary stem cells (PSCs), which uniquely express SOX2, contribute to pituitary growth and renewal. Moreover, neither the signals that drive proliferation nor their sources have been elucidated. We have used genetic approaches in the mouse, showing that the WNT pathway is essential for proliferation of all lineages in the gland. We reveal that SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;stem cells are a key source of WNT ligands. By blocking secretion of WNTs from SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;PSCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that proliferation of neighbouring committed progenitor cells declines, demonstrating that progenitor multiplication depends on the paracrine WNT secretion from SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PSCs. Our results indicate that stem cells can hold additional roles in tissue expansion and homeostasis, acting as paracrine signalling centres to coordinate the proliferation of neighbouring cells.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Goal‐directed interaction of stimulus and task demand in the parahippocampal region</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23295?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and parahippocampal region are essential for representing episodic memories involving various spatial locations and objects, and for using those memories for future adaptive behavior. The “dual‐stream model” was initially formulated based on anatomical characteristics of the medial temporal lobe, dividing the parahippocampal region into two streams that separately process and relay spatial and nonspatial information to the hippocampus. Despite its significance, the dual‐stream model in its original form cannot explain recent experimental results, and many researchers have recognized the need for a modification of the model. Here, we argue that dividing the parahippocampal region into spatial and nonspatial streams a priori may be too simplistic, particularly in light of ambiguous situations in which a sensory cue alone (e.g., visual scene) may not allow such a definitive categorization. Upon reviewing evidence, including our own, that reveals the importance of goal‐directed behavioral responses in determining the relative involvement of the parahippocampal processing streams, we propose the Goal‐directed Interaction of Stimulus and Task‐demand (GIST) model. In the GIST model, input stimuli such as visual scenes and objects are first processed by both the postrhinal and perirhinal cortices—the postrhinal cortex more heavily involved with visual scenes and perirhinal cortex with objects—with relatively little dependence on behavioral task demand. However, once perceptual ambiguities are resolved and the scenes and objects are identified and recognized, the information is then processed through the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, depending on whether it is used to fulfill navigational or non‐navigational goals, respectively. As complex sensory stimuli are utilized for both navigational and non‐navigational purposes in an intermixed fashion in naturalistic settings, the hippocampus may be required to then put together these experiences into a coherent map to allow flexible cognitive operations for adaptive behavior to occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Overlaid positive and negative feedback loops shape dynamical properties of PhoPQ two-component system</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008130</guid>

Bacteria use two-component systems (TCSs) to sense environmental conditions and change gene expression in response to those conditions. To amplify cellular responses, many bacterial TCSs are under positive feedback control, i.e. increase their expression when activated. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -sensing TCS, PhoPQ, in addition to the positive feedback, includes a negative feedback loop via the upregulation of the MgrB protein that inhibits PhoQ. How the interplay of these feedback loops shapes steady-state and dynamical responses of PhoPQ TCS to change in Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; remains poorly understood. In particular, how the presence of MgrB feedback affects the robustness of PhoPQ response to overexpression of TCS is unclear. It is also unclear why the steady-state response to decreasing Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is biphasic, i.e. plateaus over a range of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations, and then increases again at growth-limiting Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to identify potential mechanisms behind these experimentally observed dynamical properties. The results make experimentally testable predictions for the regime with response robustness and propose a novel explanation of biphasic response constraining the mechanisms for modulation of PhoQ activity by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and MgrB. Finally, we show how the interplay of positive and negative feedback loops affects the network’s steady-state sensitivity and response dynamics. In the absence of MgrB feedback, the model predicts oscillations thereby suggesting a general mechanism of oscillatory or pulsatile dynamics in autoregulated TCSs. These results improve the understanding of TCS signaling and other networks with overlaid positive and negative feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fQ4zBAtcQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Lyme carditis is an extracutaneous manifestation of Lyme disease characterized by episodes of atrioventricular block of varying degrees and additional, less reported cardiomyopathies. The molecular changes associated with the response to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we identify broad transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the heart during infection that reveal a profound down-regulation of mitochondrial components. We also describe the long-term functional modulation of macrophages exposed to live bacteria, characterized by an augmented glycolytic output, increased spirochetal binding and internalization, and reduced inflammatory responses. In vitro, glycolysis inhibition reduces the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by memory macrophages, whereas in vivo, it produces the reversion of the memory phenotype, the recovery of tissue mitochondrial components, and decreased inflammation and spirochetal burdens. These results show that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; induces long-term, memory-like responses in macrophages with tissue-wide consequences that are amenable to be manipulated in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PAFlA8PjHxs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Endosomal trafficking of receptors and associated proteins plays a critical role in signal processing. Until recently, it was thought that trafficking was shut down during cell division. Thus, remarkably, the regulation of trafficking during division remains poorly characterized. Here we delineate the role of mitotic kinases in receptor trafficking during asymmetric division. Targeted perturbations reveal that Cyclin-dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) and Aurora Kinase promote storage of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) by suppressing endosomal degradation and recycling pathways. As cells progress through metaphase, loss of CDK1 activity permits differential degradation and targeted recycling of stored receptors, leading to asymmetric induction. Mitotic receptor storage, as delineated in this study, may facilitate rapid reestablishment of signaling competence in nascent daughter cells. However, mutations that limit or enhance the release of stored signaling components could alter daughter cell fate or behavior thereby promoting oncogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GhkGFUKR_xU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Malaria parasites use a soluble RhopH complex for erythrocyte invasion and an integral form for nutrient uptake</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65282</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65282</link>
	<description>Malaria parasites use the RhopH complex for erythrocyte invasion and channel-mediated nutrient uptake. As the member proteins are unique to &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium &lt;/i&gt;spp., how they interact and traffic through subcellular sites to serve these essential functions is unknown. We show that RhopH is synthesized as a soluble complex of CLAG3, RhopH2, and RhopH3 with 1:1:1 stoichiometry. After transfer to a new host cell, the complex crosses a vacuolar membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite and becomes integral to the erythrocyte membrane through a PTEX translocon-dependent process. We present a 2.9 Å single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of the trafficking complex, revealing that CLAG3 interacts with the other subunits over large surface areas. This soluble complex is tightly assembled with extensive disulfide bonding and predicted transmembrane helices shielded. We propose a large protein complex stabilized for trafficking but poised for host membrane insertion through large-scale rearrangements, paralleling smaller two-state pore-forming proteins in other organisms.</description>

	<title>eLife: The vascular niche controls Drosophila hematopoiesis via fibroblast growth factor signaling</title>

	<description>In adult mammals, hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), is tightly regulated by extrinsic signals from the microenvironment called ‘niche’. Bone marrow HSPCs are heterogeneous and controlled by both endosteal and vascular niches. The Drosophila hematopoietic lymph gland is located along the cardiac tube which corresponds to the vascular system. In the lymph gland, the niche called Posterior Signaling Center controls only a subset of the heterogeneous hematopoietic progenitor population indicating that additional signals are necessary. Here we report that the vascular system acts as a second niche to control lymph gland homeostasis. The FGF ligand Branchless produced by vascular cells activates the FGF pathway in hematopoietic progenitors. By regulating intracellular calcium levels, FGF signaling maintains progenitor pools and prevents blood cell differentiation. This study reveals that two niches contribute to the control &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt;Drosophila blood cell homeostasis through their differential regulation of progenitors.</description>

	<title>eLife: SARS-CoV-2 entry into human airway organoids is serine protease-mediated and facilitated by the multibasic cleavage site</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64508</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64508</link>
	<description>Coronavirus entry is mediated by the spike protein which binds the receptor and mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells, and more frequently formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.</description>

	<title>eLife: A cell atlas of the chick retina based on single cell transcriptomics</title>

	<description>Retinal structure and function have been studied in many vertebrate orders, but molecular characterization has been largely confined to mammals. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cell atlas of the chick retina. We identified 136 cell types plus 14 positional or developmental intermediates distributed among the six classes conserved across vertebrates – photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and glial cells. To assess morphology of molecularly defined types, we adapted a method for CRISPR-based integration of reporters into selectively expressed genes. For Müller glia, we found that transcriptionally distinct cells were regionally localized along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and central-peripheral retinal axes. We also identified immature photoreceptor, horizontal cell and oligodendrocyte types that persist into late embryonic stages. Finally, we analyzed relationships among chick, mouse and primate retinal cell classes and types. Our results provide a foundation for anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and developmental studies of the avian visual system.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dentate gyrus development requires a cortical hem-derived astrocytic scaffold</title>

	<description>During embryonic development, radial glial cells give rise to neurons, then to astrocytes following the gliogenic switch. Timely regulation of the switch, operated by several transcription factors, is fundamental for allowing coordinated interactions between neurons and glia. We deleted the gene for one such factor, SOX9&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; early during mouse brain development and observed a significantly compromised dentate gyrus (DG). We dissected the origin of the defect, targeting embryonic &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt; deletion to either the DG neuronal progenitor domain or the adjacent cortical hem (CH). We identified in the latter previously uncharacterized ALDH1L1+ astrocytic progenitors, which form a fimbrial-specific glial scaffold necessary for neuronal progenitor migration towards the developing DG. Our results highlight an early crucial role of SOX9 for DG development through regulation of astroglial potential acquisition in the CH. Moreover, we illustrate how formation of a local network, amidst astrocytic and neuronal progenitors originating from adjacent domains, underlays brain morphogenesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Rapid adaptation to malaria facilitated by admixture in the human population of Cabo Verde</title>

	<description>Humans have undergone large migrations over the past hundreds to thousands of years, exposing ourselves to new environments and selective pressures. Yet, evidence of ongoing or recent selection in humans is difficult to detect. Many of these migrations also resulted in gene flow between previously separated populations. These recently admixed populations provide unique opportunities to study rapid evolution in humans. Developing methods based on distributions of local ancestry, we demonstrate that this sort of genetic exchange has facilitated detectable adaptation to a malaria parasite in the admixed population of Cabo Verde within the last ~20 generations. We estimate the selection coefficient is approximately 0.08, one of the highest inferred in humans. Notably, we show that this strong selection at a single locus has likely affected patterns of ancestry genome-wide, potentially biasing demographic inference. Our study provides evidence of adaptation in a human population on historical timescales.</description>

	<title>eLife: Defining human mesenchymal and epithelial heterogeneity in response to oral inflammatory disease</title>

	<description>Human oral soft tissues provide the first barrier of defence against chronic inflammatory disease and hold a remarkable scarless wounding phenotype. Tissue homeostasis requires coordinated actions of epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. However, the extent of heterogeneity within the human oral mucosa and how tissue cell types are affected during the course of disease progression is unknown. Using single-cell transcriptome profiling we reveal a striking remodelling of the epithelial and mesenchymal niches with a decrease in functional populations that are linked to the aetiology of the disease. Analysis of ligand–receptor interaction pairs identify potential intercellular hubs driving the inflammatory component of the disease. Our work establishes a reference map of the human oral mucosa in health and disease, and a framework for the development of new therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<title>eLife: Reconsidering the evidence for learning in single cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61907</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61907</link>
	<description>The question of whether single cells can learn led to much debate in the early 20th century. The view prevailed that they were capable of non-associative learning but not of associative learning, such as Pavlovian conditioning. Experiments indicating the contrary were considered either non-reproducible or subject to more acceptable interpretations. Recent developments suggest that the time is right to reconsider this consensus. We exhume the experiments of Beatrice Gelber on Pavlovian conditioning in the ciliate &lt;i&gt;Paramecium aurelia&lt;/i&gt;, and suggest that criticisms of her findings can now be reinterpreted. Gelber was a remarkable scientist whose absence from the historical record testifies to the prevailing orthodoxy that single cells cannot learn. Her work, and more recent studies, suggest that such learning may be evolutionarily more widespread and fundamental to life than previously thought and we discuss the implications for different aspects of biology.</description>

	<title>eLife: A molecular mechanism for LINC complex branching by structurally diverse SUN-KASH 6:6 assemblies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60175</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60175</link>
	<description>The LINC complex mechanically couples cytoskeletal and nuclear components across the nuclear envelope to fulfil a myriad of cellular functions, including nuclear shape and positioning, hearing and meiotic chromosome movements. The canonical model is that 3:3 interactions between SUN and KASH proteins underlie the nucleocytoskeletal linkages provided by the LINC complex. Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence that SUN-KASH is a constitutive 6:6 complex in which two constituent 3:3 complexes interact head-to-head. A common SUN-KASH topology is achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interaction mechanisms by distinct KASH proteins, including zinc-coordination by Nesprin-4. The SUN-KASH 6:6 interface provides a molecular mechanism for the establishment of integrative and distributive connections between 3:3 structures within a branched LINC complex network. In this model, SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes act as nodes for force distribution and integration between adjacent SUN and KASH molecules, enabling the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neuro‐ophthalmological findings in early Fatal Familial Insomnia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26008?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26008?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare inherited prion disease characterized by sleep, autonomic and motor disturbances. Neuro‐ophthalmological abnormalities have been reported at the onset of disease, though not further characterized. We analyzed video recordings of eye movements of six FFI patients from three unrelated kindreds, seen within six months from the onset of illness. Excessive saccadic intrusions was the most prominent finding. In patients with severe insomnia, striking saccadic intrusions are an early diagnostic clue for FFI. The fact that the thalamus is the first structure affected in FFI also suggests its role in the control of steady fixation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The effect of SMN gene dosage on ALS risk and disease severity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26009?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26009?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of &lt;i&gt;Survival of Motor Neuron&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt;) in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unclear, with several conflicting reports. A decisive result on this topic is needed, given that treatment options are available now for &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this largest multicentre case control study to evaluate the effect of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers in ALS, we used whole genome sequencing data from Project MinE data freeze 2. &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers of 6375 ALS patients and 2412 controls were called from whole genome sequencing data, and the reliability of the calls was tested with multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy number distribution of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; between cases and controls did not show any statistical differences (binomial multivariate logistic regression &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.54; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.49). In addition, the copy number of &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; did not associate with patient survival (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.78; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.23) or age at onset (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.75; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.63).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our well‐powered study there was no association of SMN1 or SMN2 copy numbers with the risk of ALS or ALS disease severity. This suggests that changing SMN protein levels in the physiological range may not modify ALS disease course. This is an important finding in the light of emerging therapies targeted at SMN deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic morphogenetic domain coexpressing Foxg1 and Otp produces most of the glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic morphogenetic domain coexpressing Foxg1 and Otp produces most of the glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eee1a997-56b9-4f36-b252-3f7d7bc9b790/cne25103-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that most glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial extended amygdala originate in a novel telencephalo‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of these neurons in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deficits in social cognition and behavior are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. The medial extended amygdala, including the medial amygdala and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, is a key component of functional networks involved in sociality. However, this nuclear complex is highly heterogeneous and contains numerous GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron subpopulations. Deciphering the connections of different neurons is essential in order to understand how this structure regulates different aspects of sociality, and it is necessary to evaluate their differential implication in distinct mental disorders. Developmental studies in different vertebrates are offering new venues to understand neuronal diversity of the medial extended amygdala, and are helping to establish a relation between the embryonic origin and molecular signature of distinct neurons with the functional subcircuits in which they are engaged. These studies have provided many details on the distinct GABAergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala, but information on the glutamatergic neurons is still scarce. Using an Otp‐eGFP transgenic mouse and multiple fluorescent labeling, we show that most glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala originate in a distinct telencephalo‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), located at the transition between telencephalon and hypothalamus, which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 but not Nkx2.1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons of the medial amygdala, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of this neuron subtype in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Location and arrangement of campaniform sensilla in Drosophila melanogaster&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/62305b4c-43c6-484a-a354-c765938336be/cne24987-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and overlap of entorhinal, premotor, and amygdalar connections in the monkey anterior cingulate cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/35da6c1e-84a7-40b4-ad93-039b676bf174/cne24986-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retrograde and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala), and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are more evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. These connection patterns are consistent with diverse roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar circuits suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mapping of the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferent projections to the anatomically defined active expiratory oscillator in adult male rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b21f262f-0dde-44da-870c-615d508a8032/cne24984-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the afferent projections to the brainstem expiratory oscillator located in the lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). We combined retrograde viruses with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of neurons. pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs that contribute to the modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labeled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labeled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS, and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus&lt;/i&gt;, no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and nonrespiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a8f761f2-bc08-40a6-a0f1-46eb3c45c154/cne24983-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Polysialic acid in the rat brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord: Distribution, cellular location, and comparison with mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a9fe946-7338-48d3-887a-7251d7dc6482/cne24982-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distribution of polysialic acid (polySia) immunoreactivity in the adult rat brainstem (a) and thoracolumbar spinal cord (b–e). Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the nucleus of solitary tract, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where choline acetyltransferase positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c–e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labeling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in DH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Modeling human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in the mouse cerebral cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d94a590-6892-441f-9a10-131a53eaaa50/cne24979-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Rat striatal regions express nuclear estrogen receptor α and GPER‐1 early in development, while aromatase expression increases with age. (a–f) Caudate–putamen micrographs depicting ERα positive cells or lack thereof females P3 (a), P20 (b), and adult (c); males P3 (d), P20 (e), and adult (f). Examples of ERα positive cells are marked by small white arrows.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate–putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, prepubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at prepuberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Light sheet microscopy of the gerbil cochlea</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Light sheet microscopy of the gerbil cochlea&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/04c97804-9e20-4bf7-9cce-0c113bd8df54/cne24977-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships—on a micrometer scale—between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane (BM), and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling BM in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be rehydrated, the BM dissected out and reimaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the BM were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear, and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the BM. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Basic quantitative morphological methods applied to the central nervous system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3d61166f-5118-457e-87f0-de4ebaba0bd3/cne24976-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design‐based stereological methods allow the estimation of basic morphological parameters in representative samples of the sectioned central nervous system. Point probes can be used to estimate volume (illustrated for the Area Fraction Fractionator), line probes can be used to estimate surface area (illustrated for a vertical sections design), area probes can be used to estimate length (illustrated for the Spaceball probe), and volume probes must be used to estimate number (illustrated for the Disector). This review provides an introduction to how these methods solve problems associated with other quantitative approaches, how they are applied to histological material, how a sampling scheme can be designed and evaluated, and which practical problems need to be solved to generate the numbers that we will need to come to an understanding of central nervous system function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated with studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity, and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough.” Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Efferent projections of Vglut2, Foxp2, and Pdyn parabrachial neurons in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f50ff309-a0bd-40e7-8da2-46842a732335/cne24975-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus surrounds the superior cerebellar peduncle at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. Its glutamatergic neurons form subpopulations with distinct genetic identities, two of which express &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we detail the location of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;‐ and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing neurons within the larger &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing population. We then use Cre‐conditional expression of synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of each population. Salient findings include the identification of glutamatergic output from the parabrachial nucleus to the rostral entorhinal cortex and lateral superior colliculus, plus an absence of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; output to the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and amygdala.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; cases was a notable lack of &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;iTBS has a stronger decision promoting effect than 20 Hz, which can be used as an effective way to alter choice and presents an improvement on standard rTMS protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can only produce a significant but weak effect on the cortex while theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned accelerated form of stimulation, can produce a stronger poststimulation effect, which may improve decision‐making abilities. We designed a comparative assessment of the effect of intermittent TBS (iTBS), 20 Hz, in two risk decision‐making tasks on healthy controls. Participants were randomized and assigned to the iTBS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), 20 Hz (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), or sham (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29) groups. The effects of the different methods of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on risk decision‐making functions were compared based on subjects’ performance in the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and Risky Gains Task (RGT). The main indicators were positive and negative feedback utilization rates of GDT and RGT. Both iTBS and 20 Hz stimulation resulted in significant improvements upon negative feedback in the GDT, with increases in safe options and reductions in risky options; iTBS stimulation increased subjects’ use of positive feedback in the GDT and RGT (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group had a stronger feedback risk reduction effect than the 20 Hz or sham group following RGT negative feedback (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Individuals would integrate positive and negative information more efficiently, leading to them making rational choices after excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, iTBS has a stronger risk reduction effect following negative feedback than the 20Hz stimulation did. In summary, iTBS might have clinical value in decision promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the complex cognitive functions of the human brain, it
is essential to study the structural connectome, i.e., the wiring of different
brain regions to each other through axonal pathways. However, the high degree
of plasticity and cross-population variability in human brains makes it
difficult to relate structure to function, motivating a search for invariant
patterns in the connectivity. At the same time, variability within a population
can provide information about generative mechanisms. In this paper we analyze
the connection topology and link-weight distribution of human structural
connectomes obtained from a database comprising 196 subjects. By demonstrating
a correspondence between the occurrence frequency of individual links and their
average weight across the population, we show that the process by which the
brain is wired is not independent of the process by which the link weights of
the connectome are determined. Furthermore, using the specific distribution of
the weights associated with each link over the entire population, we show that
a single parameter that is specific to a link can account for its frequency of
occurrence, as well as, the variation in its weight across different subjects.
This parameter provides a basis for ``rescaling'' the link weights in each
connectome, allowing us to obtain a generic network representative of the human
brain, distinct from a simple average over the connectomes. We obtain
functional connectomes by implementing a neural mass model on each of the
vertices of the corresponding structural connectomes. By comparing with the
empirical functional brain networks, we demonstrate that the rescaling
procedure yields a closer structure-function correspondence. Finally, we show
that the representative network can be decomposed into a basal component that
is stable across the population and a highly variable superstructure.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Childhood Neurotoxicity and Brain Resilience to Adverse Events during Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study used childhood cancer survivors as a novel model to study whether children who experience central nervous system (CNS) injury are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with subsequent late onset chronic health conditions (CHCs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult survivors of childhood cancer (n = 2,859, ≥10 years from diagnosis, ≥18 years old) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and clinical examination. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as age‐adjusted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; score &amp;lt; 10th percentile. Participants impaired on ≥3 tests had global impairment. CHCs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.3 (grade 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe/disabling; 4, life‐threatening) and were combined into a severity/burden score by frequency and grade (none/low, medium, high, and very high). A total of 1,598 survivors received CNS‐directed therapy including cranial radiation, intrathecal methotrexate, or neurosurgery. Logistic regression estimated the odds of neurocognitive impairment associated with severity/burden score and grade 2 to 4 conditions, stratified by CNS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNS‐treated survivors performed worse than non–CNS‐treated survivors on all neurocognitive tests and were more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment (46.9% vs 35.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for demographic and treatment factors, there was a dose–response association between severity/burden score and global neurocognitive impairment, but only among CNS‐treated survivors (high odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42–3.53; very high OR = 4.07, 95% CI = 2.30–7.17). Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions were associated with processing speed, executive function, and memory impairments in CNS‐treated but not non–CNS‐treated survivors who were impacted by neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced cognitive/brain reserve associated with CNS‐directed therapy during childhood may make survivors vulnerable to adverse cognitive effects of cardiopulmonary conditions during adulthood. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus poses serious threats to the global public health and leads to worldwide crisis. No effective drug or vaccine is readily available. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising therapeutic target. A hybrid drug screening procedure was proposed and applied to identify potential drug candidates targeting RdRp from 1906 approved drugs. Among the four selected market available drug candidates, Pralatrexate and Azithromycin were confirmed to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.008μM and 9.453 μM, respectively. For the first time, our study discovered that Pralatrexate is able to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication with a stronger inhibitory activity than Remdesivir within the same experimental conditions. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of fast and accurate anti-viral drug screening for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 and provides potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FAnRCMxpaFQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The distribution of scholarly content today happens in the context of an immense deluge of information found on the internet. As a result, researchers face serious challenges when archiving and finding information that relates to their work. Library science principles provide a framework for navigating information ecosystems in order to help researchers improve findability of their professional output. Here, we describe the information ecosystem which consists of users, context, and content, all 3 of which must be addressed to make information findable and usable. We provide a set of tips that can help researchers evaluate who their users are, how to archive their research outputs to encourage findability, and how to leverage structural elements of software to make it easier to find information within and beyond their publications. As scholars evaluate their research communication strategies, they can use these steps to improve how their research is discovered and reused.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ocC72s4QDbc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Chimpanzees (&lt;i&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/i&gt;) are, along with bonobos, humans’ closest living relatives. The advent of diffusion MRI tractography in recent years has allowed a resurgence of comparative neuroanatomical studies in humans and other primate species. Here we offer, in comparative perspective, the first chimpanzee white matter atlas, constructed from in vivo chimpanzee diffusion-weighted scans. Comparative white matter atlases provide a useful tool for identifying neuroanatomical differences and similarities between humans and other primate species. Until now, comprehensive fascicular atlases have been created for humans (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;), rhesus macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta)&lt;/i&gt;, and several other nonhuman primate species, but never in a nonhuman ape. Information on chimpanzee neuroanatomy is essential for understanding the anatomical specializations of white matter organization that are unique to the human lineage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EVgDQ5MfDv4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy (CLEIM) offers huge potential to track the intracellular fate of antibiotics, with organelle-level resolution. However, a correlative approach that enables subcellular antibiotic visualisation in pathogen-infected tissue is lacking. Here, we developed correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy in tissue (CLEIMiT) and used it to identify the cell type–specific accumulation of an antibiotic in lung lesions of mice infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. Using CLEIMiT, we found that the anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug bedaquiline (BDQ) is localised not only in foamy macrophages in the lungs during infection but also accumulate in polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/C4fV-xZSuXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Bilateral histone deacetylase 1 and 2 activity and enrichment at unique genes following induction of long‐term potentiation in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23297?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical to long‐term memory. LTP induced in vivo is characterized by altered transcriptional activity, including a period of upregulation of gene expression which is followed by a later dominant downregulation. This temporal shift to downregulated gene expression is predicted to be partly mediated by epigenetic inhibitors of gene expression, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Further, pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have previously been shown to enhance LTP persistence in vitro. To explore the contribution of HDACs to the persistence of LTP in vivo, we examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity over a 24 hr period following unilateral LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Surprisingly, we found significant changes in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity in both the stimulated as well as the unstimulated hemispheres, with the largest increase in activity occurring bilaterally, 20 min after LTP stimulation. During this time point of heightened activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were enriched at distinct sets of genes within each hemispheres. Further, the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhanced an intermediate phase of LTP lasting days, which has not previously been associated with altered transcription. The inhibitor had no effect on the persistence of LTP lasting weeks. Together, these data suggest that HDAC activity early after the induction of LTP may negatively regulate plasticity‐related gene expression that is involved in the initial stabilization of LTP, but not its long‐term maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: PremPS: Predicting the impact of missense mutations on protein stability</title>

Computational methods that predict protein stability changes induced by missense mutations have made a lot of progress over the past decades. Most of the available methods however have very limited accuracy in predicting stabilizing mutations because existing experimental sets are dominated by mutations reducing protein stability. Moreover, few approaches could consistently perform well across different test cases. To address these issues, we developed a new computational method PremPS to more accurately evaluate the effects of missense mutations on protein stability. The PremPS method is composed of only ten evolutionary- and structure-based features and parameterized on a balanced dataset with an equal number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A comprehensive comparison of the predictive performance of PremPS with other available methods on nine benchmark datasets confirms that our approach consistently outperforms other methods and shows considerable improvement in estimating the impacts of stabilizing mutations. A protein could have multiple structures available, and if another structure of the same protein is used, the predicted change in stability for structure-based methods might be different. Thus, we further estimated the impact of using different structures on prediction accuracy, and demonstrate that our method performs well across different types of structures except for low-resolution structures and models built based on templates with low sequence identity. PremPS can be used for finding functionally important variants, revealing the molecular mechanisms of functional influences and protein design. PremPS is freely available at https://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPS/, which allows to do large-scale mutational scanning and takes about four minutes to perform calculations for a single mutation per protein with ~ 300 residues and requires ~ 0.4 seconds for each additional mutation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/viIv2OJ1OX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has multiple applications in molecular biology, including developing new targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels. We present NGS-PrimerPlex, an efficient and versatile command-line application that designs primers for different refined types of amplicon-based genome target enrichment. It supports nested and anchored multiplex PCR, redistribution among multiplex reactions of primers constructed earlier, and extension of existing NGS-panels. The primer design process takes into consideration the formation of secondary structures, non-target amplicons between all primers of a pool, primers and high-frequent genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlapping. Moreover, users of NGS-PrimerPlex are free from manually defining input genome regions, because it can be done automatically from a list of genes or their parts like exon or codon numbers. Using the program, the NGS-panel for sequencing the &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; gene coding regions was created, and 354 DNA samples were studied successfully with a median coverage of 97.4% of target regions by at least 30 reads. To show that NGS-PrimerPlex can also be applied for bacterial genomes, we designed primers to detect foodborne pathogens &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7, &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; considering variable positions of the genomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bkjkub_e2Oc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The Golgi cells are the main inhibitory interneurons of the cerebellar granular layer. Although recent works have highlighted the complexity of their dendritic organization and synaptic inputs, the mechanisms through which these neurons integrate complex input patterns remained unknown. Here we have used 8 detailed morphological reconstructions to develop multicompartmental models of Golgi cells, in which Na, Ca, and K channels were distributed along dendrites, soma, axonal initial segment and axon. The models faithfully reproduced a rich pattern of electrophysiological and pharmacological properties and predicted the operating mechanisms of these neurons. Basal dendrites turned out to be more tightly electrically coupled to the axon initial segment than apical dendrites. During synaptic transmission, parallel fibers caused slow Ca-dependent depolarizations in apical dendrites that boosted the axon initial segment encoder and Na-spike backpropagation into basal dendrites, while inhibitory synapses effectively shunted backpropagating currents. This oriented dendritic processing set up a coincidence detector controlling voltage-dependent NMDA receptor unblock in basal dendrites, which, by regulating local calcium influx, may provide the basis for spike-timing dependent plasticity anticipated by theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iSwcVllqU1A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) platform-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has tremendously changed biological researches, while there are still many questions that cannot be addressed by them due to their short read lengths. We developed a novel scRNA-seq technology based on third-generation sequencing (TGS) platform (single-cell amplification and sequencing of full-length RNAs by Nanopore platform, SCAN-seq). SCAN-seq exhibited high sensitivity and accuracy comparable to NGS platform-based scRNA-seq methods. Moreover, we captured thousands of unannotated transcripts of diverse types, with high verification rate by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)–coupled Sanger sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Then, we used SCAN-seq to analyze the mouse preimplantation embryos. We could clearly distinguish cells at different developmental stages, and a total of 27,250 unannotated transcripts from 9,338 genes were identified, with many of which showed developmental stage-specific expression patterns. Finally, we showed that SCAN-seq exhibited high accuracy on determining allele-specific gene expression patterns within an individual cell. SCAN-seq makes a major breakthrough for single-cell transcriptome analysis field.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/V_5xMmYS08U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Clustering of the enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) type III secretion system (T3SS) effector translocated intimin receptor (Tir) by intimin leads to actin polymerisation and pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. The effect of Tir clustering on the viability of EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is unknown. We show that EPEC induces pyroptosis in IECs in a Tir-dependent but actin polymerisation-independent manner, which was enhanced by priming with interferon gamma (IFNγ). Mechanistically, Tir clustering triggers rapid Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, which induces lipopolysaccharide (LPS) internalisation, followed by activation of caspase-4 and pyroptosis. Knockdown of caspase-4 or gasdermin D (GSDMD), translocation of NleF, which blocks caspase-4 or chelation of extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, inhibited EPEC-induced cell death. IEC lines with low endogenous abundance of GSDMD were resistant to Tir-induced cell death. Conversely, ATP-induced extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx enhanced cell death, which confirmed the key regulatory role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in EPEC-induced pyroptosis. We reveal a novel mechanism through which infection with an extracellular pathogen leads to pyroptosis in IECs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZvVuJydp7VI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of circulating micro RNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively recruited 3 independent cohorts of patients with RCVS and age‐matched and sex‐matched controls in a single medical center. Next‐generation small RNA sequencing followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify and validate differentially expressed miRNAs, which was cross‐validated in migraine patients in ictal stage or interictal stage. Computational analysis was used to predict the target genes of miRNAs, followed by in vitro functional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a panel of miRNAs including miR‐130a‐3p, miR‐130b‐3p, let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p that well differentiated patients with RCVS from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] was 0.906, 0.890, and 0.867 in the 3 cohorts, respectively). The abundance of let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p, but not miR‐130a‐3p nor miR‐130b‐3p, was significantly higher in patients with ictal migraine compared with that of controls and patients with interictal migraine. Target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor‐β signaling pathway and endothelin‐1 responsible for vasomotor control might link these miRNAs to RCVS pathogenesis, which was confirmed in vitro by transfecting miRNAs mimics or incubating the patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 3 different vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, miR‐130a‐3p was associated with imaging‐proven disruption of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) in patients with RCVS and its overexpression led to reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (ie, increased permeability) in in vitro human BBB model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the circulating miRNA signatures associated with RCVS, which may be functionally linked to its headache, BBB integrity, and vasomotor function. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Visual opsin expression and morphological characterization of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ef2ff567-6595-4cd4-977b-afa960f6c2a5/cne25092-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; has the potential for complex color vision.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (&lt;i&gt;lws&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rh1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;rh2&lt;/i&gt;) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Functional, molecular and morphological heterogeneity of superficial interneurons in the larval zebrafish tectum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b44deb2-e868-46a8-b8e4-0fd1421d4068/cne25082-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Superficial Interneurons (SINs) of the zebrafish tectum comprise a diverse population. Here we demonstrate that despite their wide range of reported tuning properties and morphology, most SINs respond to light offset and possess large receptive fields. SINs were previously thought to be solely inhibitory, yet we report that a subset express glutamatergic markers. Finally, these cells are unlikely to be intrinsically photosensitive as removal of retinal input, eliminated nearly all light on and off responses in SINs.  (Image: Eva Laurell)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity, and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically, and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is emerging evidence for multifarious neurological manifestations of COVID‐19, while little is known whether they reflect structural damage to the nervous system. Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a specific biomarker of neuronal injury. We measured sNfL concentrations of 29 critically ill COVID‐19 patients, 10 critically ill non‐COVID‐19 patients, and 259 healthy controls. After adjusting for neurological comorbidities and age, sNfL were higher in patients with COVID‐19 versus both comparator groups. Higher sNfL levels were associated with unfavorable short‐term outcome indicating that neuronal injury is common and pronounced in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells’ alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional re‐assignment of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Short‐Term Cessation of Dabigatran Causes a Paradoxical Prothrombotic State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25964?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25964?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short‐term (1–3 days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten‐week‐old C57Bl/6 mice (n = 338) received one of the following oral treatments: phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), dabigatran for 7 days with or without 1 to 4 day cessation, and aspirin in either a single dose or daily for 7 days. Some of the animals that ceased dabigatran for 1 to 3 days received single‐dose aspirin. Thereafter, we induced FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐mediated carotid thrombosis in 130 mice, after which we performed micro computed tomography thrombus imaging. The other 208 mice underwent coagulation assays or platelet function tests. As an explorative pilot study, we reviewed the medical records of 18 consecutive patients with NOAC cessation‐related cerebral infarction in a large acute stroke cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a ~ 40% higher volume of carotid thrombus after dabigatran cessation at 1 to 3 days than after vehicle treatment and showed that this effect could be prevented by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. Dabigatran cessation unduly increased platelet aggregability for 2 days after drug cessation, an effect mediated through thrombin or arachidonic acid, which effect was significantly attenuated by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. In patients, short‐term (≤ 3 days) cessation of NOAC therapy, compared with longer‐term (≥ 5 days) cessation, tended to be associated with relatively high stroke severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide the first preclinical evidence that a rebound prothrombotic state follows short‐term cessation of dabigatran therapy. ANN NEUROL 2021&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Reasoning about the factors underlying habitat connectivity and the inter-habitat movement of species is essential to many areas of biological inquiry. In order to better describe and understand the ways in which the landscape may support species movement, an increasing amount of research has focused on identification of paths or corridors that may be important in providing connectivity among habitat. The least-cost path problem has proven to be an instrumental analytical tool in this sense. A complicating aspect of such path identification methods is how to best reconcile and integrate the array of criteria or objectives that species may consider in traversal of a landscape. In cases where habitat connectivity is thought to be influenced or guided by multiple objectives, numerous solutions to least-cost path problems can exist, representing tradeoffs between the objectives. In practice though, identification of these solutions can be very challenging and as such, only a small proportion of them are typically examined leading to a weak characterization of habitat connectivity. To address this computational challenge, a multiobjective optimization framework is proposed. A generalizable multiobjective least-cost path model is first detailed. A non-inferior set estimation (MONISE) algorithm for identifying supported efficient solutions to the multiobjective least-cost path model is then described. However, it is well known that unsupported efficient solutions (which are equally important) can also exist, but are typically ignored given that they are more difficult to identify. Thus, to enable the identification of the full set of efficient solutions (supported and unsupported) to the multiobjective model, a multi-criteria labeling algorithm is then proposed. The developed framework is applied to assess different conceptualizations of habitat connectivity supporting amphibian movement in a wetland system. The results highlight the range of tradeoffs in characterizations of connectivity that can exist when multiple objectives are thought to contribute to movement decisions and that the number of unsupported efficient solutions (which are typically ignored) can vastly outweigh that of the supported efficient solutions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei-KBrK73DI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Combinatorial therapies are required to treat patients with advanced cancers that have become resistant to monotherapies through rewiring of redundant pathways. Due to a massive number of potential drug combinations, there is a need for systematic approaches to identify safe and effective combinations for each patient, using cost-effective methods. Here, we developed an exact multiobjective optimization method for identifying pairwise or higher-order combinations that show maximal cancer-selectivity. The prioritization of patient-specific combinations is based on Pareto-optimization in the search space spanned by the therapeutic and nonselective effects of combinations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in the context of BRAF-V600E melanoma treatment, where the optimal solutions predicted a number of co-inhibition partners for vemurafenib, a selective BRAF-V600E inhibitor, approved for advanced melanoma. We experimentally validated many of the predictions in BRAF-V600E melanoma cell line, and the results suggest that one can improve selective inhibition of BRAF-V600E melanoma cells by combinatorial targeting of MAPK/ERK and other compensatory pathways using pairwise and third-order drug combinations. Our mechanism-agnostic optimization method is widely applicable to various cancer types, and it takes as input only measurements of a subset of pairwise drug combinations, without requiring target information or genomic profiles. Such data-driven approaches may become useful for functional precision oncology applications that go beyond the cancer genetic dependency paradigm to optimize cancer-selective combinatorial treatments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQFi8d3CAl4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium, causes anthrax. The external surface of the exosporium is coated with glycosylated proteins. The sugar additions are capped with the unique monosaccharide anthrose. The West African Group (WAG) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; have mutations rendering them anthrose deficient. Through genome sequencing, we identified 2 different large chromosomal deletions within the anthrose biosynthetic operon of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; strains from Chile and Poland. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis identified an anthrose-deficient strain in the anthrax outbreak among European heroin users. Anthrose-deficient strains are no longer restricted to West Africa so the role of anthrose in physiology and pathogenesis was investigated in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; Sterne. Loss of anthrose delayed spore germination and enhanced sporulation. Spores without anthrose were phagocytized at higher rates than spores with anthrose, indicating that anthrose may serve an antiphagocytic function on the spore surface. The anthrose mutant had half the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and decreased time to death (TTD) of wild type and complement &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; Sterne in the A/J mouse model. Following infection, anthrose mutant bacteria were more abundant in the spleen, indicating enhanced dissemination of Sterne anthrose mutant. At low sample sizes in the A/J mouse model, the mortality of Δ&lt;i&gt;antC&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice challenged by intranasal or subcutaneous routes was 20% greater than wild type. Competitive index (CI) studies indicated that spores without anthrose disseminated to organs more extensively than a complemented mutant. Death process modeling using mouse mortality dynamics suggested that larger sample sizes would lead to significantly higher deaths in anthrose-negative infected animals. The model was tested by infecting &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; with spores and confirmed the anthrose mutant was significantly more lethal. Vaccination studies in the A/J mouse model showed that the human vaccine protected against high-dose challenges of the nonencapsulated Sterne-based anthrose mutant. This work begins to identify the physiologic and pathogenic consequences of convergent anthrose mutations in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xLHjWAFmZzo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Coordination of cell growth is essential for the development of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glial and neuronal size are poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in glial size regulation, we used &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; amphid sheath (AMsh) glia as a model and show that a conserved &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi membrane protein &lt;i&gt;eas-1/GOLT1B&lt;/i&gt; negatively regulates glial growth. We found that &lt;i&gt;eas-1&lt;/i&gt; inhibits a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt;/RNF145, which, in turn, promotes nuclear activation of &lt;i&gt;sbp-1/&lt;/i&gt; SREBP, a key regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, to restrict cell growth. At early developmental stages, &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi network inhibits &lt;i&gt;sbp-1&lt;/i&gt; activation to promote the growth of glia, and when animals reach the adult stage, this inhibition is released through an &lt;i&gt;eas-1-&lt;/i&gt;dependent shuttling of &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi network to stop glial growth. Furthermore, we identified long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as downstream products of the &lt;i&gt;eas-1-rnf-145-sbp-1&lt;/i&gt; pathway that functions to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Together, our findings reveal a novel and potentially conserved mechanism underlying glial size control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lnZqLcygP-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Host–pathogen conflicts leave genetic signatures in genes that are critical for host defense functions. Using these “molecular scars” as a guide to discover gene functions, we discovered a vertebrate-specific MItochondrial STress Response (MISTR) circuit. MISTR proteins are associated with electron transport chain (ETC) factors and activated by stress signals such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) and hypoxia. Upon stress, ultraconserved microRNAs (miRNAs) down-regulate MISTR1(NDUFA4) followed by replacement with paralogs MItochondrial STress Response AntiViral (MISTRAV) and/or MItochondrial STress Response Hypoxia (MISTRH). While cells lacking MISTR1(NDUFA4) are more sensitive to chemical and viral apoptotic triggers, cells lacking MISTRAV or expressing the squirrelpox virus-encoded vMISTRAV exhibit resistance to the same insults. Rapid evolution signatures across primate genomes for &lt;i&gt;MISTR1(NDUFA4)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MISTRAV&lt;/i&gt; indicate recent and ongoing conflicts with pathogens. MISTR homologs are also found in plants, yeasts, a fish virus, and an algal virus indicating ancient origins and suggesting diverse means of altering mitochondrial function under stress. The discovery of MISTR circuitry highlights the use of evolution-guided studies to reveal fundamental biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lko71xOFkvE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: CEP290 is essential for the initiation of ciliary transition zone assembly</title>

Cilia play critical roles during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Dysfunction of cilia leads to various human genetic diseases, including many caused by defects in transition zones (TZs), the “gates” of cilia. The evolutionarily conserved TZ component centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) is the most frequently mutated human ciliopathy gene, but its roles in ciliogenesis are not completely understood. Here, we report that CEP290 plays an essential role in the initiation of TZ assembly in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Mechanistically, the N-terminus of CEP290 directly recruits DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 (DZIP1), which then recruits Chibby (CBY) and Rab8 to promote early ciliary membrane formation. Complete deletion of CEP290 blocks ciliogenesis at the initiation stage of TZ assembly, which can be mimicked by DZIP1 deletion mutants. Remarkably, expression of the N-terminus of CEP290 alone restores the TZ localization of DZIP1 and subsequently ameliorates the defects in TZ assembly initiation in &lt;i&gt;cep290&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Our results link CEP290 to DZIP1-CBY/Rab8 module and uncover a previously uncharacterized important function of CEP290 in the coordination of early ciliary membrane formation and TZ assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/aG3YmgUwtug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Structural analyses of the PKA RIIβ holoenzyme containing the oncogenic DnaJB1-PKAc fusion protein reveal protomer asymmetry and fusion-induced allosteric perturbations in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsan-Wen Lu, Phillip C. Aoto, Jui-Hung Weng, Cole Nielsen, Jennifer N. Cash, James Hall, Ping Zhang, Sanford M. Simon, Michael A. Cianfrocco, Susan S. Taylor&lt;/p&gt;

When the J-domain of the heat shock protein DnaJB1 is fused to the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), replacing exon 1, this fusion protein, J-C subunit (J-C), becomes the driver of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC). Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize J-C bound to RIIβ, the major PKA regulatory (R) subunit in liver, thus reporting the first cryo-EM structure of any PKA holoenzyme. We report several differences in both structure and dynamics that could not be captured by the conventional crystallography approaches used to obtain prior structures. Most striking is the asymmetry caused by the absence of the second cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and the J-domain in one of the RIIβ:J-C protomers. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we discovered that this asymmetry is already present in the wild-type (WT) RIIβ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but had been masked in the previous crystal structure. This asymmetry may link to the intrinsic allosteric regulation of all PKA holoenzymes and could also explain why most disease mutations in PKA regulatory subunits are dominant negative. The cryo-EM structure, combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), also allowed us to predict the general position of the Dimerization/Docking (D/D) domain, which is essential for localization and interacting with membrane-anchored A-Kinase-Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). This position provides a multivalent mechanism for interaction of the RIIβ holoenzyme with membranes and would be perturbed in the oncogenic fusion protein. The J-domain also alters several biochemical properties of the RIIβ holoenzyme: It is easier to activate with cAMP, and the cooperativity is reduced. These results provide new insights into how the finely tuned allosteric PKA signaling network is disrupted by the oncogenic J-C subunit, ultimately leading to the development of FL-HCC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SxEStF5xD4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Long-term experimental evolution of HIV-1 reveals effects of environment and mutational history</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001010</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Bons, Christine Leemann, Karin J. Metzner, Roland R. Regoes&lt;/p&gt;

An often-returning question for not only HIV-1, but also other organisms, is how predictable evolutionary paths are. The environment, mutational history, and random processes can all impact the exact evolutionary paths, but to which extent these factors contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of a particular system is an open question. Especially in a virus like HIV-1, with a large mutation rate and large population sizes, evolution is expected to be highly predictable if the impact of environment and history is low, and evolution is not neutral. We investigated the effect of environment and mutational history by analyzing sequences from a long-term evolution experiment, in which HIV-1 was passaged on 2 different cell types in 8 independent evolutionary lines and 8 derived lines, 4 of which involved a switch of the environment. The experiments lasted for 240–300 passages, corresponding to approximately 400–600 generations or almost 3 years. The sequences show signs of extensive parallel evolution—the majority of mutations that are shared between independent lines appear in both cell types, but we also find that both environment and mutational history significantly impact the evolutionary paths. We conclude that HIV-1 evolution is robust to small changes in the environment, similar to a transmission event in the absence of an immune response or drug pressure. We also find that the fitness landscape of HIV-1 is largely smooth, although we find some evidence for both positive and negative epistatic interactions between mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4erFhbSb4yI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Increased prostaglandin-D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in male STAT3-deficient hearts shifts cardiac progenitor cells from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation</title>

Cardiac levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor-3 (STAT3) decline with age, and male but not female mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 deficiency conditional knockout (CKO) display premature age-related heart failure associated with reduced cardiac capillary density. In the present study, isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased prostaglandin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen receptor (AR)–signaling due to loss of its cofactor STAT3. Elevated PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared with the adipocyte differentiation of male wild-type (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Epas1&lt;/i&gt;) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene &lt;i&gt;Zfp423&lt;/i&gt; associated with up-regulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared with WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared with male WT-CPC, whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2, thereby up-regulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of young male CKO mice with the COX inhibitor Ibuprofen or the PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (DP)2 receptor antagonist BAY-u 3405 in vivo increased EZH2 expression and reduced ZFP423 expression and adipocyte differentiation in CKO-CPC. Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3 deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG-degrading enzyme HPGD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bZIPnUYRK2w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Delineating reef fish trophic guilds with global gut content data synthesis and phylogeny</title>

Understanding species’ roles in food webs requires an accurate assessment of their trophic niche. However, it is challenging to delineate potential trophic interactions across an ecosystem, and a paucity of empirical information often leads to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion, especially when applied to hyperdiverse ecosystems. Using coral reef fishes as a model group, we show that experts disagree on the assignment of broad trophic guilds for more than 20% of species, which hampers comparability across studies. Here, we propose a quantitative, unbiased, and reproducible approach to define trophic guilds and apply recent advances in machine learning to predict probabilities of pairwise trophic interactions with high accuracy. We synthesize data from community-wide gut content analyses of tropical coral reef fishes worldwide, resulting in diet information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish. We then use network analysis to identify 8 trophic guilds and Bayesian phylogenetic modeling to show that trophic guilds can be predicted based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Finally, we use machine learning to test whether pairwise trophic interactions can be predicted with accuracy. Our models achieved a misclassification error of less than 5%, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, as well as high-resolution probabilities of trophic interactions. By applying our framework to the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, we show that it can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. Our work thus provides a viable approach to account for the complexity of predator–prey interactions in highly diverse ecosystems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gkLuvPEX4Ak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We diagnosed 11 Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) cases among 71,904 COVID patients attended at 61 Spanish emergency departments (EDs) during the 2‐month pandemic peak. The relative frequency of GBS among ED patients was higher in COVID (0.15‰) than non‐COVID (0.02‰) patients (odds ratio [OR] = 6.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18–12.5), as was the standardized incidence (9.44 and 0.69 cases/100,000 inhabitant‐years, respectively, OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 9.87–18.4). Regarding clinical characteristics, olfactory–gustatory disorders were more frequent in COVID‐GBS than non‐COVID–GBS (OR = 27.59, 95% CI = 1.296–587) and COVID–non‐GBS (OR = 7.875, 95% CI = 1.587–39.09) patients. Although COVID‐GBS patients were more frequently admitted to intensive care, mortality was not increased versus control groups. Our results suggest SARS‐CoV‐2 could be another viral infection causing GBS. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment of malignant gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent within tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Conventional treatments for this CNS tumor include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery is still being considered as the treatment of choice. Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM. In the current review, we revisit the main advances of PDT for GBM management and also, the recent mechanistic insights about cellular and molecular aspects related to tumoral resistance to PDT of GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CD8+ T‐lymphocyte driven limbic encephalitis results in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26000?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26000?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limbic encephalitis (LE) comprises a spectrum of inflammatory changes in affected brain structures including the presence of autoantibodies and lymphoid cells. Still, the potential of distinct lymphocyte subsets alone to elicit key clinico‐pathological sequelae of LE potentially inducing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with chronic spontaneous seizures and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we scrutinized pathogenic consequences emerging from CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells targeting hippocampal neurons by recombinant adeno‐associated virus‐mediated expression of the model‐autoantigen Ovalbumin (OVA) in CA1 neurons of OT‐I/RAG1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice (termed ‘OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model’).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral‐mediated antigen transfer caused dense CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell infiltrates confined to the hippocampal formation starting on day five after virus transduction. Flow cytometry indicated priming of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells in brain‐draining lymph nodes to precede hippocampal invasion. At the acute model stage, the inflammatory process was accompanied by frequent seizure activity and impairment of hippocampal memory skills. MRI‐scans at day seven of the OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model revealed hippocampal edema and blood‐brain‐barrier disruption that converted into atrophy until day 40. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells specifically targeted OVA‐expressing, SIINFEKL‐H‐2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; positive CA1 neurons and caused segmental apoptotic neurodegeneration, astrogliosis and microglial activation. At the chronic model stage, mice exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and persisting memory deficits, whilst the sclerotic hippocampus was populated with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells escorted by NK‐cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that a CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell initiated attack of distinct hippocampal neurons is sufficient to induce LE converting into TLE‐HS. Intriguingly, the role of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells exceeds neurotoxic effects and points to their major pathogenic role in TLE following LE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Structural basis for noradrenergic regulation of neural circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84d3ff4c-cb5f-4ca6-8a2f-b47b1299da28/cne25085-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Social isolation is closely linked to a marked reduction in physical activity in male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4de7253b-27df-4c6e-a816-72511f472bb4/jnr24777-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By observing the behavior of mice in their home cage environment, using the powerful PhenoTyper tracking system, we demonstrate that mice display dramatic reductions in movement and exploration when isolated from their cage mates, an instantaneous effect that escalates over the next 5 days, which is reversible upon re‐pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel‐based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re‐paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Axonal mitochondria adjust in size depending on g‐ratio of surrounding myelin during homeostasis and advanced remyelination</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Axonal mitochondria adjust in size depending on g‐ratio of surrounding myelin during homeostasis and advanced remyelination&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e29653c-6822-4313-bd6d-9b8faae89700/jnr24767-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Identification and Localization of a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Related Neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an Intermediate Host for Schistosomiasis</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification and Localization of a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Related Neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an Intermediate Host for Schistosomiasis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f3da04bd-e198-4f6b-81d2-c4d0155bc303/cne25099-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) in the central nervous system and periphery of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria glabrata&lt;/i&gt;, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshwater snails of the genus &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/i&gt; larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as ‘parasitic castration’. As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria alexandrina&lt;/i&gt; that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (designated &lt;i&gt;Biom&lt;/i&gt;‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against &lt;i&gt;Biom&lt;/i&gt;‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of &lt;i&gt;B. glabrata&lt;/i&gt;. GnRH‐like immunoreactive (GnRHli) fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the GABRB2‐Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25985?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25985?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;, coding for the γ‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor subunit β2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte model system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmacoresistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varies by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABAergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Covert speech comprehension predicts recovery from acute unresponsive states</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25995?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25995?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside‐markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2‐7‐days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronises with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17‐ and 16‐patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at three‐ and six‐months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r&amp;gt;.6, p&amp;lt;.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta=.603, p=.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (e.g. Glasgow Coma Scale, Computer Tomography (CT) grade).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision‐making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

Zoonotic avian influenza viruses pose severe health threats to humans. Of several viral subtypes reported, the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus has since February 2013 caused more than 1,500 cases of human infection with an almost 40% case-fatality rate. Vaccination of poultry appears to reduce human infections. However, the emergence of highly pathogenic strains has increased concerns about H7N9 pandemics. To develop an efficacious H7N9 human vaccine, we designed vaccine viruses by changing the patterns of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycosylation (NLG) on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein based on evolutionary patterns of H7 HA NLG changes. Notably, a virus in which 2 NLG modifications were added to HA showed higher growth rates in cell culture and elicited more cross-reactive antibodies than did other vaccine viruses with no change in the viral antigenicity. Developed into an inactivated vaccine formulation, the vaccine virus with 2 HA NLG additions exhibited much better protective efficacy against lethal viral challenge in mice than did a vaccine candidate with wild-type (WT) HA by reducing viral replication in the lungs. In a ferret model, the 2 NLG-added vaccine viruses also induced hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts compared with the WT HA vaccines. In a mode of action study, the HA NLG modification appeared to increase HA protein contents incorporated into viral particles, which would be successfully translated to improve vaccine efficacy. These results suggest the strong potential of HA NLG modifications in designing avian influenza vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tD-eDoOH63s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (&lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;) and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-derived poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; posttranscriptionally up-regulated &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-deleted cells. C9-ALS patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;. Lentiviral overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin β1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in C9-ALS/FTD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PGYGt4CxIDM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Histone variants expand chromatin functions in eukaryote genomes. &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes are testis-expressed short histone H2A variants that arose in placental mammals. Their biological functions remain largely unknown. To investigate their function, we generated a knockout (KO) model that disrupts all 3 &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes in mice. We show that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males have globally altered chromatin structure in postmeiotic germ cells. Yet, they do not show impaired spermatogenesis or testis function. Instead, we find that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; plays a crucial role postfertilization. Crosses between &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males and females yield embryos with lower viability and reduced size. Using a series of genetic crosses that separate parental and zygotic contributions, we show that the &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; status of both the father and mother, but not of the zygote, affects embryonic viability and growth during gestation. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is a novel parental-effect gene, establishing a role for short H2A histone variants in mammalian development. We posit that parental antagonism over embryonic growth drove the origin and ongoing diversification of short histone H2A variants in placental mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/38O2OT1oGoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Detection of functional connectivity in the brain during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks: A functional near‐infrared spectroscopy study</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Detection of functional connectivity in the brain during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks: A functional near‐infrared spectroscopy study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1d9b6dd9-0ddf-414a-a4d5-24450d96162a/jnr24769-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states. The FC of lSMC‐lPFC and rSMC‐rPFC (intrahemispheric region pairs) strengthened with a higher task load. The results provided new insights into the FC between brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: N‐cadherin localization in taste buds of mouse circumvallate papillae</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25090?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;N‐cadherin localization in taste buds of mouse circumvallate papillae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/725af322-842c-4a8b-a5c9-885a4ee65dfa/cne25090-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Endocannabinoid-Like Lipid Neuromodulators in the Regulation of Dopamine Signaling: Relevance for Drug Addiction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.588660</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.588660</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The family of lipid neuromodulators has been rapidly growing, as the use of different -omics techniques led to the discovery of a large number of naturally occurring N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and N-acyl amino acids belonging to the complex lipid signaling system termed endocannabinoidome. These molecules exert a variety of biological activities in the central nervous system, as they modulate physiological processes in neurons and glial cells and are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Their effects on dopamine cells have attracted attention, as dysfunctions of dopamine systems characterize a range of psychiatric disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUD). While canonical endocannabinoids are known to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs impinging on dopamine cells and modulate several dopamine-mediated behaviors, such as reward and addiction, the effects of other lipid neuromodulators are far less clear. Here, we review the emerging role of endocannabinoid-like neuromodulators in dopamine signaling, with a focus on non-cannabinoid N-acylethanolamines and their receptors. Mounting evidence suggests that these neuromodulators contribute to modulate synaptic transmission in dopamine regions and might represent a target for novel medications in alcohol and nicotine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Target Molecules of STIM Proteins in the Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.617422</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.617422</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), including STIM1 and STIM2, are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They serve as calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) sensors within the ER. In the central nervous system (CNS), they are involved mainly in Orai-mediated store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). The key molecular components of the SOCE pathway are well-characterized, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this pathway need further investigation. Numerous intracellular target proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, ER, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm have been reported to play essential roles in concert with STIMs, such as conformational changes in STIMs, their translocation, the stabilization of their interactions with Orai, and the activation of other channels. The present review focuses on numerous regulators, such as Homer, SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF), septin, synaptopodin, golli proteins, partner of STIM1 (POST), and transcription factors and proteasome inhibitors that regulate STIM-Orai interactions in the CNS. Further we describe novel roles of STIMs in mediating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via other than Orai pathways, including TRPC channels, VGCCs, AMPA and NMDA receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. This review also summarizes recent findings on additional molecular targets of STIM proteins including SERCA, IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, end-binding proteins (EB), presenilin, and CaMKII. Dysregulation of the SOCE-associated toolkit, including STIMs, contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and stroke. Emerging evidence points to the role of STIM proteins and several of their molecular effectors and regulators in neuronal and glial physiology and pathology, suggesting their potential application for future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Recent Developments in Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) Mass Spectrometry: Application of Quantitative Analysis of the Brain Proteome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.564446</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.564446</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry is the driving force behind current brain proteome analysis. In a typical proteomics approach, a protein isolate is digested into tryptic peptides and then analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The recent advancements in data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage than the classic data dependent acquisition. DIA cycles through a pre-defined set of peptide precursor isolation windows stepping through 400–1,200 m/z across the whole liquid chromatography gradient. All peptides within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides are identified by matching the ion peaks in a mass spectrum to a spectral library that contains information of the peptide fragment ions' pattern and its chromatography elution time. Currently, there are several reports on DIA in brain research, in particular the quantitative analysis of cellular and synaptic proteomes to reveal the spatial and/or temporal changes of proteins that underlie neuronal plasticity and disease mechanisms. Protocols in DIA are continuously improving in both acquisition and data analysis. The depth of analysis is currently approaching proteome-wide coverage, while maintaining high reproducibility in a stable and standardisable MS environment. DIA can be positioned as the method of choice for routine proteome analysis in basic brain research and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Frontal Functional Network Disruption Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An fNIRS-Based Minimum Spanning Tree Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.613990</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.613990</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence increasingly associates network disruption in brain organization with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare terminal disease. However, the comparability of brain network characteristics across different studies remains a challenge for conventional graph theoretical methods. One suggested method to address this issue is minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis, which provides a less biased comparison. Here, we assessed the novel application of MST network analysis to hemodynamic responses recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging modality, during an activity-based paradigm to investigate hypothetical disruptions in frontal functional brain network topology as a marker of the executive dysfunction, one of the most prevalent cognitive deficit reported across ALS studies. We analyzed data recorded from nine participants with ALS and ten age-matched healthy controls by first estimating functional connectivity, using phase-locking value (PLV) analysis, and then constructing the corresponding individual and group MSTs. Our results showed significant between-group differences in several MST topological properties, including leaf fraction, maximum degree, diameter, eccentricity, and degree divergence. We further observed a global shift toward more centralized frontal network organizations in the ALS group, interpreted as a more random or dysregulated network in this cohort. Moreover, the similarity analysis demonstrated marginally significantly increased overlap in the individual MSTs from the control group, implying a reference network with lower topological variation in the healthy cohort. Our nodal analysis characterized the main local hubs in healthy controls as distributed more evenly over the frontal cortex, with slightly higher occurrence in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), while in the ALS group, the most frequent hubs were asymmetrical, observed primarily in the right prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the global PLV (gPLV) synchronization metric is associated with disease progression, and a few topological properties, including leaf fraction and tree hierarchy, are linked to disease duration. These results suggest that dysregulation, centralization, and asymmetry of the hemodynamic-based frontal functional network during activity are potential neuro-topological markers of ALS pathogenesis. Our findings can possibly support new bedside assessments of the functional status of ALS’ brain network and could hypothetically extend to applications in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis caused by spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury result in neurological dysfunction. MicroRNAs (miRs) have crucial functions in spinal cord I/R injury pathogenesis according to previous evidences. Herein, whether miR-128-3p contributes to spinal cord I/R injury by regulating specificity protein 1 (SP1) was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A rat model of spinal cord I/R injury was established by occluding the aortic arch for 14 min. Then, miR-128-3p’s interaction with SP1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Next, miR-128-3p mimic and inhibitor, as well as adenovirus-delivered shRNA specific for SP1 were injected intrathecally for assessing the effects of miR-128-3p and SP1 on rats with spinal cord I/R injury. SP1, Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels in I/R injured spinal cord tissues were evaluated by Western blotting, while IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were quantitated by ELISA. Tarlov scores were obtained to detect hind-limb motor function. Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation was utilized to examine blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for neuronal apoptosis assessment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MiR-128-3p expression was decreased, while SP1 amounts were increased in rat spinal cord tissue specimens following I/R. SP1 was identified as a miR-128-3p target and downregulated by miR-128-3p. MiR-128-3p overexpression or SP1 silencing alleviated I/R-induced neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis, and improved Tarlov scores, whereas pretreatment with miR-128-3p inhibitor aggravated the above injuries.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Overexpression of miR-128-3p protects neurons from neuroinflammation and apoptosis during spinal cord I/R injury partially by downregulating SP1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Improving Accuracy of Brainstem MRI Volumetry: Effects of Age and Sex, and Normalization Strategies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609422</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609422</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Brainstem-mediated functions are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Atrophy can be visualized by MRI. This study investigates extrinsic sources of brainstem volume variability, intrinsic sources of anatomical variability, and the influence of age and sex on the brainstem volumes in healthy subjects. We aimed to develop efficient normalization strategies to reduce the effects of intrinsic anatomic variability on brainstem volumetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Brainstem segmentation was performed from MPRAGE data using our deep-learning-based brainstem segmentation algorithm MD-GRU. The extrinsic variability of brainstem volume assessments across scanners and protocols was investigated in two groups comprising 11 (median age 33.3 years, 7 women) and 22 healthy subjects (median age 27.6 years, 50% women) scanned twice and compared using Dice scores. Intrinsic anatomical inter-individual variability and age and sex effects on brainstem volumes were assessed in segmentations of 110 healthy subjects (median age 30.9 years, range 18–72 years, 53.6% women) acquired on 1.5T (45%) and 3T (55%) scanners. The association between brainstem volumes and predefined anatomical covariates was studied using Pearson correlations. Anatomical variables with associations of |r| &amp;gt; 0.30 as well as the variables age and sex were used to construct normalization models using backward selection. The effect of the resulting normalization models was assessed by % relative standard deviation reduction and by comparing the inter-individual variability of the normalized brainstem volumes to the non-normalized values using paired t- tests with Bonferroni correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The extrinsic variability of brainstem volumetry across different field strengths and imaging protocols was low (Dice scores &amp;gt; 0.94). Mean inter-individual variability/SD of total brainstem volumes was 9.8%/7.36. A normalization based on either total intracranial volume (TICV), TICV and age, or v-scale significantly reduced the inter-individual variability of total brainstem volumes compared to non-normalized volumes and similarly reduced the relative standard deviation by about 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The extrinsic variability of the novel brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU across different scanners and imaging protocols is very low. Anatomic inter-individual variability of brainstem volumes is substantial. This study presents efficient normalization models for variability reduction in brainstem volumetry in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is associated with the cerebral accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In studies of cognitive neuroscience, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is widely used as it offers richer information than traditional univariate analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), as one method of MVPA, has become an effective decoding method based on neural data by calculating the similarity between different representations in the brain under different conditions. Moreover, RSA is suitable for researchers to compare data from different modalities and even bridge data from different species. However, previous toolboxes have been made to fit specific datasets. Here, we develop NeuroRA, a novel and easy-to-use toolbox for representational analysis. Our toolbox aims at conducting cross-modal data analysis from multi-modal neural data (e.g., EEG, MEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and other sources of neruroelectrophysiological data), behavioral data, and computer-simulated data. Compared with previous software packages, our toolbox is more comprehensive and powerful. Using NeuroRA, users can not only calculate the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which reflects the representational similarity among different task conditions and conduct a representational analysis among different RDMs to achieve a cross-modal comparison. Besides, users can calculate neural pattern similarity (NPS), spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS), and inter-subject correlation (ISC) with this toolbox. NeuroRA also provides users with functions performing statistical analysis, storage, and visualization of results. We introduce the structure, modules, features, and algorithms of NeuroRA in this paper, as well as examples applying the toolbox in published datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Increased Phase Cone Turnover in 80–250 Hz Bands Occurs in the Epileptogenic Zone During Interictal Periods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.615744</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80–150 and 150–250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Differential Effects of Up- and Down-Regulation of SMR Coherence on EEG Activity and Memory Performance: A Neurofeedback Training Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modulating connectivity measures in EEG-based neurofeedback studies is assumed to be a promising therapeutic and training tool. However, little is known so far about its effects and trainability. In the present study, we investigated the effects of up- and down-regulating SMR (12–15 Hz) coherence by means of neurofeedback training on EEG activity and memory functions. Twenty adults performed 10 neurofeedback training sessions in which half of them tried to increase EEG coherence between Cz and CPz in the SMR frequency range, while the other half tried to down-regulate coherence. Up-regulation of SMR coherence led to between- and within-session changes in EEG coherence. SMR power increased across neurofeedback training sessions but not within training sessions. Cross-over training effects on baseline EEG measures were also observed in this group. Up-regulation of SMR coherence was also associated with improvements in memory functions when comparing pre- and post-test results. Participants were not able to down-regulate SMR coherence. This group did not show any changes in baseline EEG measures or memory functions comparing pre- and post-test. Our results provide insights in the trainability and effects of connectivity-based neurofeedback training and indications for its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Repeatability and Reproducibility of in-vivo Brain Temperature Measurements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.598435</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.598435</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that may be useful for non-invasive mapping of brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Healthy participants aged 23–46 years (N = 18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2°C with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 37.0, p &amp;lt; 0.0001] and for brain region [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.66, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. The time&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;brain region interaction was not significant [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.80, p = 0.83]. Participants' T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 to 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); majority of ROIs had a COVrep &amp;lt;2.0%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Brain temperature measurements were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring brain temperature changes in health and disease. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the threshold above which T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; is likely pathological.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Working Memory in Aphasia: The Role of Temporal Information Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589802</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language functions resulting from a brain lesion. It is usually accompanied by deficits in non-linguistic cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate in patients with aphasia the complex interrelationships between selected cognitive functions: auditory speech comprehension, working memory (WM), and temporal information processing (TIP) in the millisecond time range. Thirty right-handed subjects (20 males) aged from 27 to 82 years suffering from post-stroke aphasia participated in the study. Verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM) were assessed with: (1) a receptive verbal test and (2) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, respectively. Both these WM tests used the forward tasks (mainly engaging maintenance processes, i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and backward tasks (engaging both maintenance and manipulation processes, i.e., reordering and updating information). Auditory comprehension was assessed by receptive language tests, and TIP efficiency was assessed by auditory perception of temporal order in the millisecond time range. We observed better performance of forward WM tasks than backward ones, independently of the type of material used. Furthermore, the severity of auditory comprehension impairment correlated with the efficiency on both forward and backward VWM tasks and the backward SWM task. Further analysis revealed that TIP plays a crucial role only in the latter task. These results indicate the divergent pattern of interactions between WM and TIP depending on the type of WM tasks. Level of verbal competency appeared to play an important role in both VWM tasks, whereas TIP (which is associated with manipulation processes) appeared to be important for SWM, but only on the backward task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Repeated Contrast Adaptation Does Not Cause Habituation of the Adapter</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589634</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589634</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation can optimize information processing by allowing the visual system to always adjust to the environment. However, only a few studies have investigated how the visual system makes adjustments to repeatedly occurring changes in the input, still less about the related neural mechanism. Our previous study found that contrast adaptation attenuated after multiple daily sessions of repeated adaptation, which was explained by the habituation of either the adapter’s effective strength or the adaptation mechanisms. To examine the former hypothesis, in the present study we used the frequency tagging technique to measure the adapter-elicited steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitudes. Participants repeatedly adapted to the same contrast adapter in a top-up manner for six continuous days, which was called training of adaptation. The behavioral adaptation effect and SSVEP response to the trained adapter and an untrained control adapter were measured before and after training. The psychophysical results showed that the effect of adaptation in the trained condition significantly reduced after training, replicating our previous finding. Contradicting the prediction of the hypothesis that repeated adaptation attenuated the effective strength of the adapter, the SSVEP amplitude was unchanged after training, which was further confirmed by an equivalence test. Taken together, the results challenge the account of habituation of adapter in repeated adaptation, while leaving the account of habituation of adaptation mechanism to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Involvement of the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Numerical Rule Induction: A Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566675</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566675</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerical inductive reasoning has been considered as one of the most important higher cognitive functions of the human brain. Importantly, previous behavioral studies have consistently reported that one critical component of numerical inductive reasoning is checking, which often occurs when a discrepant element is discovered, and reprocessing is needed to determine whether the discrepancy is an error of the original series. However, less is known about the neural mechanism underlying the checking process. Given that the checking effect involves cognitive control processes, such as the incongruent resolution, that are linked to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), this study hypothesizes that the right DLPFC may play a specific role in the checking process. To test the hypothesis, this study utilized the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method that could modulate cortical excitability, and examined whether and how the stimulation of the right DLPFC via tDCS could modulate the checking effect during a number-series completion problem task. Ninety healthy participants were allocated to one of the anodal, cathodal, and sham groups. Subjects were required to verify whether number sequences formed rule-based series, and checking effect was assessed by the difference in performance between invalid and valid conditions. It was found that significantly longer response times (RTs) were exhibited in invalid condition compared with valid condition in groups of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Furthermore, the anodal tDCS significantly shortened the checking effect than those of the cathodal and sham groups, whereas no significantly prolonged checking effect was detected in the cathodal group. The current findings indicated that anodal tDCS affected the process of checking, which suggested that the right DLPFC might play a critical role in the checking process of numerical inductive reasoning by inhibiting incongruent response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Dynamic Modulation of a Learned Motor Skill for Its Recruitment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.457682</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.457682</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans learn motor skills (MSs) through practice and experience and may then retain them for recruitment, which is effective as a rapid response for novel contexts. For an MS to be recruited for novel contexts, its recruitment range must be extended. In addressing this issue, we hypothesized that an MS is dynamically modulated according to the feedback context to expand its recruitment range into novel contexts, which do not involve the learning of an MS. The following two sub-issues are considered. We previously demonstrated that the learned MS could be recruited in novel contexts through its modulation, which is driven by dynamically regulating the synergistic redundancy between muscles according to the feedback context. However, this modulation is trained in the dynamics under the MS learning context. Learning an MS in a specific condition naturally causes movement deviation from the desired state when the MS is executed in a novel context. We hypothesized that this deviation can be reduced with the additional modulation of an MS, which tunes the MS-produced muscle activities by using the feedback gain signals driven by the deviation from the desired state. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a feedback gain signal-driven tuning model of a learned MS for its robust recruitment. This model is based on the neurophysiological architecture in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, in which an MS is plausibly retained as it was learned and is then recruited by tuning its muscle control signals according to the feedback context. In this study, through computational simulation, we show that the proposed model may be used to neurophysiologically describe the recruitment of a learned MS in novel contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Neural Interactions in Developing Rhythmogenic Spinal Networks: Insights From Computational Modeling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms involved in generation of rhythmic locomotor activity in the mammalian spinal cord remain poorly understood. These mechanisms supposedly rely on both intrinsic properties of constituting neurons and interactions between them. A subset of Shox2 neurons was suggested to contribute to generation of spinal locomotor activity, but the possible cellular basis for rhythmic bursting in these neurons remains unknown. Ha and Dougherty (2018) recently revealed the presence of bidirectional electrical coupling between Shox2 neurons in neonatal spinal cords, which can be critically involved in neuronal synchronization and generation of populational bursting. Gap junctional connections found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons decrease with age, possibly being replaced by increasing interactions through chemical synapses. Here, we developed a computational model of a heterogeneous population of neurons sparsely connected by electrical or/and chemical synapses and investigated the dependence of frequency of populational bursting on the type and strength of neuronal interconnections. The model proposes a mechanistic explanation that can account for the emergence of a synchronized rhythmic activity in the neuronal population and provides insights into the possible role of gap junctional coupling between Shox2 neurons in the spinal mechanisms for locomotor rhythm generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: AAV-Mediated GALC Gene Therapy Rescues Alpha-Synucleinopathy in the Spinal Cord of a Leukodystrophic Lysosomal Storage Disease Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Krabbe's disease (KD) is primarily a demyelinating disorder, but recent studies have identified the presence of neuronal protein aggregates in the brain, at least partially composed by alpha-synuclein (α-syn). The role of this protein aggregation in the pathogenesis of KD is largely unknown, but it has added KD to a growing list of lysosomal storage diseases that can be also be considered as proteinopathies. While the presence of these protein aggregates within the KD brain is now appreciated, the remainder of the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncharacterized. This study is the first to report the presence of thioflavin-S reactive inclusions throughout the spinal cord of both murine and human spinal tissue. Stereological analysis revealed the temporal and spatial accumulation of these inclusions within the neurons of the ventral spinal cord vs. those located in the dorsal cord. This study also confirmed that these thio-S positive accumulations are present within neuronal populations and are made up at least in part by α-syn in both the twitcher mouse and cord autopsied material from affected human patients. Significantly, neonatal gene therapy for galactosylceramidase, a treatment that strongly improves the survival and health of KD mice, but not bone marrow transplantation prevents the formation of these inclusions in spinal neurons. These results expand the understanding of α-syn protein aggregation within the CNS of individuals afflicted with KD and underlines the tractability of this problem via early gene therapy, with potential impact to other synucleinopathies such as PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chronic Tear Deficiency Sensitizes Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1-Mediated Responses in Corneal Sensory Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.598678</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic tear deficiency enhances the excitability of corneal cold-sensitive nerves that detect ocular dryness, which can lead to discomfort in patients with dry eye disease (DED). However, changes in corneal nerve excitations through the polymodal nociceptor “transient receptor potential vanilloid 1” (TRPV1) and the potential link between this receptor and symptoms of DED remain unclear. In this study, we examined the firing properties of corneal cold-sensitive nerves expressing TRPV1 and possible contributions of chronic tear deficiency to corneal nerve excitability by TRPV1 activation. The bilateral excision of lacrimal glands in guinea pigs decreased the tear volume and increased the frequency of spontaneous eyeblinks 1–4 weeks after surgery. An analysis of the firing properties of the cold-sensitive nerves was performed by single-unit recordings of corneal preparations 4 weeks after surgery in both the sham-operated and gland-excised groups. Perfusion of the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (1 μM), transiently increased the firing frequency in approximately 46–48% of the cold-sensitive nerves characterized by low-background activity and high threshold (LB-HT) cold thermoreceptors in both groups. Gland excision significantly decreased the latency of capsaicin-induced firing in cold-sensitive nerves; however, its magnitude was unchanged. Calcium imaging of cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons from both groups showed that intracellular calcium elevation of corneal neurons induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.03 μM) was significantly larger in the gland excision group, regardless of responsiveness to cold. An immunohistochemical study of the trigeminal ganglion revealed that gland excision significantly increased the proportion of corneal neurons enclosed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive satellite glial cells. Topical application of the TRPV1 antagonist, A784168 (30 μM), on the ocular surface attenuated eye-blink frequency after gland excision. Furthermore, gland excision enhanced blink behavior induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.1 μM). These results suggest that chronic tear deficiency sensitizes the TRPV1-mediated response in the corneal LB-HT cold thermoreceptors and cold-insensitive polymodal nociceptors, which may be linked to dry eye discomfort and hyperalgesia resulting from nociceptive stimuli in aqueous-deficient dry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chemically Induced Models of Parkinson’s Disease: History and Perspectives for the Involvement of Ferroptosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson’s disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (AD and HD), many of the characteristics of PD can be reproduced in vivo by the use of specific neurotoxins. Given the indication of ferroptosis in PD pathology, several studies have been conducted to examine whether ferroptosis plays role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. However, there are still few reports showing an authentic form of ferroptosis in neuronal cells during exposure to the neurotoxins used as PD inducers. In this review article, we summarize the history of the uses of chemicals to create PD models in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we also survey recent reports examining the possible involvement of ferroptosis in chemical models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Does Diet Have a Role in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aging process causes many changes to the brain and is a major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite an already vast amount of research on AD, a greater understanding of the disease's pathology and therapeutic options are desperately needed. One important distinction that is also in need of further study is the ability to distinguish changes to the brain observed in early stages of AD vs. changes that occur with normal aging. Current FDA-approved therapeutic options for AD patients have proven to be ineffective and indicate the need for alternative therapies. Aging interventions including alterations in diet (such as caloric restriction, fasting, or methionine restriction) have been shown to be effective in mediating increased health and lifespan in mice and other model organisms. Because aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, certain dietary interventions should be explored as they have the potential to act as a future treatment option for AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Cognitive Profile of Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Dementia With Lewy Bodies—An Updated Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597579</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597579</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia. Yet, the domain-specific cognitive impairment of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase of this disease (DLB-MCI) is still not been established. This article gives an updated review on the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI, building on the findings from a previous review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed systematic review and searched five different electronic databases (Scopus, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) in May 2020 based on a PICO scheme. Our search was then restricted to articles published in 2019 and 2020. Ending up with a total of 90 articles to be reviewed by abstract and/or full text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total four papers were included, whereof only one met our full inclusion criteria. Despite a substantial heterogeneity, our findings indicate that DLB-MCI patients have a pattern of executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The findings indicate that the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI is characterized by executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits. Furthermore, the shortage of studies clearly underlines the paucity of published research into DLB-MCI and emphasizes the need for well-controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 33; lorazepam, n = 23; diazepam, n = 24), 30 recommend intramuscular benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 30; lorazepam, n = 8; diazepam, n = 3), and 27 recommend intranasal benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 27; lorazepam, n = 3); pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n = 14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subtype Diagnosis of Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease with Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25983?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25983?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination. We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure—prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI (PriSCA_MRI)—uses only MRI examinations; the second—PriSCA_MRI + Gen—includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Expansion of RiPP biosynthetic space through integration of pan-genomics and machine learning uncovers a novel class of lanthipeptides</title>

Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bknPhbPA6VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Primordial follicle assembly in the mouse occurs during perinatal ages and largely determines the ovarian reserve that will be available to support the reproductive life span. The development of primordial follicles is controlled by a complex network of interactions between oocytes and ovarian somatic cells that remain poorly understood. In the present research, using single-cell RNA sequencing performed over a time series on murine ovaries, coupled with several bioinformatics analyses, the complete dynamic genetic programs of germ and granulosa cells from E16.5 to postnatal day (PD) 3 were reported. Along with confirming the previously reported expression of genes by germ cells and granulosa cells, our analyses identified 5 distinct cell clusters associated with germ cells and 6 with granulosa cells. Consequently, several new genes expressed at significant levels at each investigated stage were assigned. By building single-cell pseudotemporal trajectories, 3 states and 1 branch point of fate transition for the germ cells were revealed, as well as for the granulosa cells. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment enabled identification of the biological process most represented in germ cells and granulosa cells or common to both cell types at each specific stage, and the interactions of germ cells and granulosa cells basing on known and novel pathway were presented. Finally, by using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) algorithm, we were able to establish a network of regulons that can be postulated as likely candidates for sustaining germ cell-specific transcription programs throughout the period of investigation. Above all, this study provides the whole transcriptome landscape of ovarian cells and unearths new insights during primordial follicle assembly in mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFIJU6CdENw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Phosphorylation of seryl-tRNA synthetase by ATM/ATR is essential for hypoxia-induced angiogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000991</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/rZ9l5M1hOJk/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yi Shi, Ze Liu, Qian Zhang, Ingrid Vallee, Zhongying Mo, Shuji Kishi, Xiang-Lei Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101D/S241D&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the &lt;i&gt;VEGFA&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and activation of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt; strongly inhibits normal and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development. The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in pathological settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rZ9l5M1hOJk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Design of novel granulopoietic proteins by topological rescaffolding</title>

Computational protein design is rapidly becoming more powerful, and improving the accuracy of computational methods would greatly streamline protein engineering by eliminating the need for empirical optimization in the laboratory. In this work, we set out to design novel granulopoietic agents using a rescaffolding strategy with the goal of achieving simpler and more stable proteins. All of the 4 experimentally tested designs were folded, monomeric, and stable, while the 2 determined structures agreed with the design models within less than 2.5 Å. Despite the lack of significant topological or sequence similarity to their natural granulopoietic counterpart, 2 designs bound to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and exhibited potent, but delayed, in vitro proliferative activity in a G-CSF-dependent cell line. Interestingly, the designs also induced proliferation and differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem cells into mature granulocytes, highlighting the utility of our approach to develop highly active therapeutic leads purely based on computational design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4g376v1rJ3I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Oligodendrocytes support axonal transport and maintenance via exosome secretion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000621</guid>

Neurons extend long axons that require maintenance and are susceptible to degeneration. Long-term integrity of axons depends on intrinsic mechanisms including axonal transport and extrinsic support from adjacent glial cells. The mechanisms of support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes to underlying axons are only partly understood. Oligodendrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties of exosomes, which upon delivery to neurons improve neuronal viability in vitro. Here, we show that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is impaired in 2 mouse mutants exhibiting secondary axonal degeneration due to oligodendrocyte-specific gene defects. Wild-type oligodendroglial exosomes support neurons by improving the metabolic state and promoting axonal transport in nutrient-deprived neurons. Mutant oligodendrocytes release fewer exosomes, which share a common signature of underrepresented proteins. Notably, mutant exosomes lack the ability to support nutrient-deprived neurons and to promote axonal transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia-to-neuron exosome transfer promotes neuronal long-term maintenance by facilitating axonal transport, providing a novel mechanistic link between myelin diseases and secondary loss of axonal integrity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ph2iKJtdsn8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Age, sex, and regional differences in scavenger receptor CD36 in the mouse brain: Potential relevance to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/697eb9f1-564c-4fe2-b30e-897c004fe20e/cne25089-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cellular and behavioral basis of cannabinioid and opioid interactions: Implications for opioid dependence and withdrawal</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre‐clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post‐receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward‐seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction‐related processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Natural Compounds as Inhibitors of Aβ Peptide Aggregation: Chemical Requirements and Molecular Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with no cure and preventive therapy. Misfolding and extracellular aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are recognized as the main cause of AD progression, leading to the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers and to the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brain, representing the hallmarks of AD. Given the urgent need to provide alternative therapies, natural products serve as vital resources for novel drugs. In recent years, several natural compounds with different chemical structures, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received attention for their role against the neurodegenerative pathological processes. However, only for a small subset of them experimental evidences are provided on their mechanism of action. This review focuses on those natural compounds shown to interfere with Aβ aggregation by direct interaction with Aβ peptide and whose inhibitory mechanism has been investigated by means of biophysical and structural biology experimental approaches. In few cases, the combination of approaches offering a macroscopic characterization of the oligomers, such as TEM, AFM, fluorescence, together with high-resolution methods could shed light on the complex mechanism of inhibition. In particular, solution NMR spectroscopy, through peptide-based and ligand-based observation, was successfully employed to investigate the interactions of the natural compounds with both soluble NMR-visible (monomer and low molecular weight oligomers) and NMR-invisible (high molecular weight oligomers and protofibrils) species. The molecular determinants of the interaction of promising natural compounds are here compared to infer the chemical requirements of the inhibitors and the common mechanisms of inhibition. Most of the data converge to indicate that the Aβ regions relevant to perturb the aggregation cascade and regulate the toxicity of the stabilized oligomers, are the N-term and β1 region. The ability of the natural aggregation inhibitors to cross the brain blood barrier, together with the tactics to improve their low bioavailability are discussed. The analysis of the data ensemble can provide a rationale for the selection of natural compounds as molecular scaffolds for the design of new therapeutic strategies against the progression of early and late stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Role of Sirtuins in Modulating Neurodegeneration of the Enteric Nervous System and Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.614331</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration of the central and enteric nervous systems is a common feature of aging and aging-related diseases, and is accelerated in individuals with metabolic dysfunction including obesity and diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in both the CNS and ENS are overlapping. Sirtuins are an important family of histone deacetylases that are important for genome stability, cellular response to stress, and nutrient and hormone sensing. They are activated by calorie restriction (CR) and by the coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Sirtuins, specifically the nuclear SIRT1 and mitochondrial SIRT3, have been shown to have predominantly neuroprotective roles in the CNS while the cytoplasmic sirtuin, SIRT2 is largely associated with neurodegeneration. A systematic study of sirtuins in the ENS and their effect on enteric neuronal growth and survival has not been conducted. Recent studies, however, also link sirtuins with important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, melatonin, and serotonin which influence many important processes including satiety, mood, circadian rhythm, and gut homeostasis. In this review, we address emerging roles of sirtuins in modulating the metabolic challenges from aging, obesity, and diabetes that lead to neurodegeneration in the ENS and CNS. We also highlight a novel role for sirtuins along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in modulating neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: RatLesNetv2: A Fully Convolutional Network for Rodent Brain Lesion Segmentation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.610239</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.610239</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a fully convolutional neural network (ConvNet), named RatLesNetv2, for segmenting lesions in rodent magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. RatLesNetv2 architecture resembles an autoencoder and it incorporates residual blocks that facilitate its optimization. RatLesNetv2 is trained end to end on three-dimensional images and it requires no preprocessing. We evaluated RatLesNetv2 on an exceptionally large dataset composed of 916 T2-weighted rat brain MRI scans of 671 rats at nine different lesion stages that were used to study focal cerebral ischemia for drug development. In addition, we compared its performance with three other ConvNets specifically designed for medical image segmentation. RatLesNetv2 obtained similar to higher Dice coefficient values than the other ConvNets and it produced much more realistic and compact segmentations with notably fewer holes and lower Hausdorff distance. The Dice scores of RatLesNetv2 segmentations also exceeded inter-rater agreement of manual segmentations. In conclusion, RatLesNetv2 could be used for automated lesion segmentation, reducing human workload and improving reproducibility. RatLesNetv2 is publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/RatLesNetv2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Auditory Noise Leads to Increased Visual Brain-Computer Interface Performance: A Cross-Modal Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590963</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise has been proven to have a beneficial role in non-linear systems, including the human brain, based on the stochastic resonance (SR) theory. Several studies have been implemented on single-modal SR. Cross-modal SR phenomenon has been confirmed in different human sensory systems. In our study, a cross-modal SR enhanced brain–computer interface (BCI) was proposed by applying auditory noise to visual stimuli. Fast Fourier transform and canonical correlation analysis methods were used to evaluate the influence of noise, results of which indicated that a moderate amount of auditory noise could enhance periodic components in visual responses. Directed transfer function was applied to investigate the functional connectivity patterns, and the flow gain value was used to measure the degree of activation of specific brain regions in the information transmission process. The results of flow gain maps showed that moderate intensity of auditory noise activated the brain area to a greater extent. Further analysis by weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) revealed that the phase synchronization between visual and auditory regions under auditory noise was significantly enhanced. Our study confirms the existence of cross-modal SR between visual and auditory regions and achieves a higher accuracy for recognition, along with shorter time window length. Such findings can be used to improve the performance of visual BCIs to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Case Report: Concurrent Resistance and Aerobic Training Regulate Adiponectin Expression and Disease Severity in Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567302</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adapted exercise is an effective non-pharmacological tool to improve functional, cognitive, and psychological parameters in multiple sclerosis (MS), in association with increased quality of life (QoL) and decreased disease severity. Adipose tissue, through the production of different adipokines, is involved in regulating energy metabolism and inflammation. Adiponectin, increased in MS, circulates as oligomers of low (LMW), medium (MMW), and high molecular weight (HMW), the latter mediating the main biological effects. The aim of study was to evaluate the effects of 4 months training at moderate intensity [65% heart rate reserve (HRR)] on BMI, adiponectin, and QoL in a volunteer with secondary progressive MS. The parameters were evaluated before (T0), after 4 months training (T1), and 6 months after the end of training (T2); total serum adiponectin and its oligomeric profile were evaluated. We found a reduction in BMI (−0.9%) and FAT (−2.6%), an improvement in perceived QoL and a reduced expression of total adiponectin and HMW oligomers together with decreased MS disability level at T1 measured by EDSS. Despite the limitations of a case study, this represent a starting point to understand the influence of exercise in MS and the relationship with adiponectin expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Semi-Automated and Direct Localization and Labeling of EEG Electrodes Using MR Structural Images for Simultaneous fMRI-EEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558981</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558981</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) source reconstruction estimates spatial information from the brain’s electrical activity acquired using EEG. This method requires accurate identification of the EEG electrodes in a three-dimensional (3D) space and involves spatial localization and labeling of EEG electrodes. Here, we propose a new approach to tackle this two-step problem based on the simultaneous acquisition of EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the step of spatial localization of electrodes, we extract the electrode coordinates from the curvature of the protrusions formed in the high-resolution T1-weighted brain scans. In the next step, we assign labels to each electrode based on the distinguishing feature of the electrode’s distance profile in relation to other electrodes. We then compare the subject’s electrode data with template-based models of prelabeled distance profiles of correctly labeled subjects. Based on this approach, we could localize EEG electrodes in 26 head models with over 90% accuracy in the 3D localization of electrodes. Next, we performed electrode labeling of the subjects’ data with progressive improvements in accuracy: with ∼58% accuracy based on a single EEG-template, with ∼71% accuracy based on 3 EEG-templates, and with ∼76% accuracy using 5 EEG-templates. The proposed semi-automated method provides a simple alternative for the rapid localization and labeling of electrodes without the requirement of any additional equipment than what is already used in an EEG-fMRI setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Voluntary and Involuntary Attention in Bistable Visual Perception: A MEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597895</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597895</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, voluntary and involuntary visual attention focused on different interpretations of a bistable image, were investigated using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A Necker cube with sinusoidally modulated pixels' intensity in the front and rear faces with frequencies 6.67 Hz (60/9) and 8.57 Hz (60/7), respectively, was presented to 12 healthy volunteers, who interpreted the cube as either left- or right-oriented. The tags of these frequencies and their second harmonics were identified in the average Fourier spectra of the MEG data recorded from the visual cortex. In the first part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to voluntarily control their attention by interpreting the cube orientation as either being on the left or right. Accordingly, we observed the dominance of the corresponding spectral component, and voluntary attention performance was measured. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a red marker at the center of the cube image without putting forth effort in its interpretation. The alternation of the dominant spectral energies at the second harmonics of the stimulation frequencies was treated as changes in the cube orientation. Based on the results of the first experimental stage and using a wavelet analysis, we developed a method which allowed us to identify the currently perceived cube orientation. Finally, we characterized involuntary attention using the distribution of dominance times when focusing attention on one of the cube orientations, which was related to voluntary attention performance and brain noise. In particular, we confirmed our hypothesis that higher attention performance is associated with stronger brain noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Evidence for [Coronal] Underspecification in Typical and Atypical Phonological Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580697</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580697</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) theory predicts that [coronal] is the language universal default place of articulation for phonemes. This assumption has been consistently supported with adult behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data; however, this underspecification claim has not been tested in developmental populations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children demonstrate [coronal] underspecification patterns similar to those of adults. Two English consonants differing in place of articulation, [labial] /b/ and [coronal] /d/, were presented to 24 children (ages 4–6 years) characterized by either a typically developing phonological system (TD) or a phonological disorder (PD). Two syllables, /bɑ/ and /dɑ/, were presented in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Underspecification was examined with three analyses: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of single-subject data. Contrary to previous adult findings, children with PD demonstrated a large positive mismatch response (PMR) to /bɑ/ while the children with TD exhibited a negative mismatch response (MMN); significant group differences were not observed in the /dɑ/ responses. Moreover, the /bɑ/ deviant ERP response was significantly larger in the TD children than in the children with PD. At the single-subject level, more children demonstrated mismatch responses to /dɑ/ than to /bɑ/, though some children had a /bɑ/ mismatch response and no /dɑ/ mismatch response. While both groups of children demonstrated similar responses to the underspecified /dɑ/, their neural responses to the more specified /bɑ/ varied. These findings are interpreted within a proposed developmental model of phonological underspecification, wherein children with PD are functioning at a developmentally less mature stage of phonological acquisition than their same-aged TD peers. Thus, phonological underspecification is a phenomenon that likely develops over time with experience and exposure to language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Overground Walking Decreases Alpha Activity and Entrains Eye Movements in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561755</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (~10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Will We Ever Have Conscious Machines?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The question of whether artificial beings or machines could become self-aware or conscious has been a philosophical question for centuries. The main problem is that self-awareness cannot be observed from an outside perspective and the distinction of being really self-aware or merely a clever imitation cannot be answered without access to knowledge about the mechanism's inner workings. We investigate common machine learning approaches with respect to their potential ability to become self-aware. We realize that many important algorithmic steps toward machines with a core consciousness have already been taken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cellular and Synaptic Mechanisms That Differentiate Mitral Cells and Superficial Tufted Cells Into Parallel Output Channels in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.614377</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.614377</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common feature of the primary processing structures of sensory systems is the presence of parallel output “channels” that convey different information about a stimulus. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, this is reflected in the mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) that have differing sensitivities to odors, with TCs being more sensitive than MCs. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms underlying the different responses of MCs vs. TCs. For TCs, we focused on superficial TCs (sTCs), which are a population of output TCs that reside in the superficial-most portion of the external plexiform layer, along with external tufted cells (eTCs), which are glutamatergic interneurons in the glomerular layer. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse bulb slices, we first measured excitatory currents in MCs, sTCs, and eTCs following olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) stimulation, separating the responses into a fast, monosynaptic component reflecting direct inputs from OSNs and a prolonged component partially reflecting eTC-mediated feedforward excitation. Responses were measured to a wide range of OSN stimulation intensities, simulating the different levels of OSN activity that would be expected to be produced by varying odor concentrations in vivo. Over a range of stimulation intensities, we found that the monosynaptic current varied significantly between the cell types, in the order of eTC &amp;gt; sTC &amp;gt; MC. The prolonged component was smaller in sTCs vs. both MCs and eTCs. sTCs also had much higher whole-cell input resistances than MCs, reflecting their smaller size and greater membrane resistivity. To evaluate how these different electrophysiological aspects contributed to spiking of the output MCs and sTCs, we used computational modeling. By exchanging the different cell properties in our modeled MCs and sTCs, we could evaluate each property's contribution to spiking differences between these cell types. This analysis suggested that the higher sensitivity of spiking in sTCs vs. MCs reflected both their larger monosynaptic OSN signal as well as their higher input resistance, while their smaller prolonged currents had a modest opposing effect. Taken together, our results indicate that both synaptic and intrinsic cellular features contribute to the production of parallel output channels in the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Long Non-coding RNA LINC00320 Inhibits Tumorigenicity of Glioma Cells and Angiogenesis Through Downregulation of NFKB1-Mediated AQP9</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.542552</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inhibitory effect of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00320 (LINC00320) in glioma cell proliferation has been proposed in a recent study. However, the mechanisms by which LINC00320 regulate aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in glioma require further exploration. Hence, this study aims to investigate effects of LINC00320 on tumorigenicity of glioma cells and angiogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Expression of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma tissues and cells was measured by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The relationship among LINC00320, nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) and AQP9 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The participation of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma cell proliferation and MVEC angiogenesis was analyzed using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Finally, a nude mouse orthotopic xenograft model of glioma was established to investigate the effects of LINC00320 and AQP9 on glioma growth in vivo. LINC00320 was under-expressed and AQP9 was over-expressed in glioma tissues. Further mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00320 downregulated AQP9 by inhibiting the recruitment of NFKB1 to the promoter region of AQP9. LINC00320 overexpression or AQP9 silencing inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and angiogenesis of MVECs. Also, upregulation of LINC00320 restrained tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenograft mice by downregulating AQP9. Taken together, LINC00320 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma, thus presenting a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605317</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of dual-task training on cognitive status, physical performance, and brain oscillation of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty-six AD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the training group (TG) and control group (CG). TG executed progressive combined exercises with visual stimulation twice a week for 12 weeks. Training included muscle endurance, balance, flexibility, and aerobic exercises with eyes closed and opened. Brain oscillation on electroencephalography (EEG) and a series of physical, cognitive, and mental tests were taken before and post-intervention. There was a significant improvement after training protocol in cognitive function, particularly in short-term and working memory, attention, and executive function (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Besides, there were substantial improvements in depression status (GDS scale), aerobic fitness (6 min walking), flexibility (chair sit and reach) functional ability (chair stand, timed up and go test), strength (knee extensions, preacher biceps curl, handgrip) in TG compared to CG. These signs of progress were associated with a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the frequency of brain oscillation and a decrease in the theta/alpha ratio. In addition to physical performance, the regular combined training with visual stimulation improves brain health as indicated by improving cognitive function and reducing the theta/alpha ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) https://www.irct.ir/, identifier IRCT20190504043468N1—August 5, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Irisin is a PGC-1α-dependent myokine that causes increased energy expenditure by driving the development of white adipose tissue into brown fat-like tissue. Exercise can improve irisin levels and lead to its release into the blood. In ischemic stroke, neurons are always sensitive to energy supply; after a series of pathophysiological processes, reactive oxygen species that are detrimental to cell survival via mitochondrial dysfunction are generated in large quantities. As a protein associated with exercise, irisin can alleviate brain injury in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. It is thought that irisin can upregulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which protects nerve cells from injury during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the release of irisin into the blood via exercise influences the mitochondrial dynamics crucial to maintaining the normal function of nerve cells. Consequently, we intended to summarize the known effects of irisin during ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term) and in the long‐term after surgery. All demographic variables, neuroimaging data and clinical characteristics available were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long‐term was defined as a reduction lower than 25% of the Movement Disorder Society‐UPDRS (MDS‐UPDRS) part‐III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up: 8.4 ± 6.26 years; median: 10 years, 1–17 range), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UDPRS part‐III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients available with 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part‐III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects.&lt;/p&gt;
