	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Combining theory, model and experiment to understand how theta rhythms are generated in thehippocampus</title>

	<description>Scientists have observed theta rhythms (3-12 Hz) in the hippocampus for decades, but we do not have a clear understanding of how they are generated. This is largely due to the complex, multi-scale and nonlinear nature of the brain. To obtain insight into mechanisms underlying the generation of theta rhythms, we develop cellular-based network models of the hippocampus based on a whole hippocampus in vitro preparation that spontaneously generates theta rhythms. Building on theoretical and computational analyses, we find that spike frequency adaptation and post-inhibitory rebound constitute a basis for theta generation in large, minimally connected CA1 pyramidal (PYR) cell network models with fast-firing parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory cells. The particular theta frequency is more controlled by PYR to PV+ cell interactions rather than PV+ to PYR cell ones. We identify two scenarios by which theta rhythms can emerge and they can be differentiated by the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory currents to PV+ cells, but not to PYR cells. Only one of the scenarios is consistent with data from the whole hippocampus preparation, which leads to the prediction that the connection probability from PV+ to PYR cells needs to be larger than from PYR to PV+ cells. Our models can serve as a platform on which to build and develop an understanding of in vivo theta generation, and of microcircuit dynamics in the hippocampus.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A human judgment approach to epidemiological forecasting</title>

Infectious diseases impose considerable burden on society, despite significant advances in technology and medicine over the past century. Advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic. Historically, such a capability has lagged for many reasons, including in particular the uncertainty in the current state of the system and in the understanding of the processes that drive epidemic trajectories. Presently we have access to data, models, and computational resources that enable the development of epidemiological forecasting systems. Indeed, several recent challenges hosted by the U.S. government have fostered an open and collaborative environment for the development of these technologies. The primary focus of these challenges has been to develop statistical and computational methods for epidemiological forecasting, but here we consider a serious alternative based on collective human judgment. We created the web-based “Epicast” forecasting system which collects and aggregates epidemic predictions made in real-time by human participants, and with these forecasts we ask two questions: how accurate is human judgment, and how do these forecasts compare to their more computational, data-driven alternatives? To address the former, we assess by a variety of metrics how accurately humans are able to predict influenza and chikungunya trajectories. As for the latter, we show that real-time, combined human predictions of the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 U.S. flu seasons are often more accurate than the same predictions made by several statistical systems, especially for short-term targets. We conclude that there is valuable predictive power in collective human judgment, and we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Km_GyWoMTI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An essential step toward understanding neural circuits is linking their
structure and their dynamics. In general, this relationship can be almost
arbitrarily complex. Recent theoretical work has, however, begun to identify
some broad principles underlying collective spiking activity in neural
circuits. The first is that local features of network connectivity can be
surprisingly effective in predicting global statistics of activity across a
network. The second is that, for the important case of large networks with
excitatory-inhibitory balance, correlated spiking persists or vanishes
depending on the spatial scales of recurrent and feedforward connectivity. We
close by showing how these ideas, together with plasticity rules, can help to
close the loop between network structure and activity statistics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Discrete modes of social information processing predict individual behavior of fish in a group. (arXiv:1703.03065v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individual computations and social interactions underlying collective
behavior in groups of animals are of great ethological, behavioral, and
theoretical interest. While complex individual behaviors have successfully been
parsed into small dictionaries of stereotyped behavioral modes, studies of
collective behavior largely ignored these findings; instead, their focus was on
inferring single, mode-independent social interaction rules that reproduced
macroscopic and often qualitative features of group behavior. Here we bring
these two approaches together to predict individual swimming patterns of adult
zebrafish in a group. We show that fish alternate between an active mode in
which they are sensitive to the swimming patterns of conspecifics, and a
passive mode where they ignore them. Using a model that accounts for these two
modes explicitly, we predict behaviors of individual fish with high accuracy,
outperforming previous approaches that assumed a single continuous computation
by individuals and simple metric or topological weighing of neighbors behavior.
At the group level, switching between active and passive modes is uncorrelated
among fish, yet correlated directional swimming behavior still emerges. Our
quantitative approach for studying complex, multi-modal individual behavior
jointly with emergent group behavior is readily extensible to additional
behavioral modes and their neural correlates, as well as to other species.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sustained sensorimotor control as intermittent decisions about prediction errors: Computational framework and application to ground vehicle steering. (arXiv:1703.03030v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03030</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03030</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A conceptual and computational framework is proposed for modelling of human
sensorimotor control, and is exemplified for the sensorimotor task of steering
a car. The framework emphasises control intermittency, and extends on existing
models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control
using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes
of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is
shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent
control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a
superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically
observed corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows
straightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing
one-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological
psychology traditions. Empirical observations from a driving simulator provide
support for some of the framework assumptions: It is shown that human steering
control, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better
described as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as
continuous control. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steering
adjustments are well predicted by a compound visual cue signalling steering
error, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue
is affected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumulation is shown to
explain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and
adjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold
mechanisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent
control.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our desire and fascination with intelligent machines dates back to the
antiquity's mythical automaton Talos, Aristotle's mode of mechanical thought
(syllogism) and Heron of Alexandria's mechanical machines and automata.
However, the quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is troubled with
repeated failures of strategies and approaches throughout the history. This
decade has seen a shift in interest towards bio-inspired software and hardware,
with the assumption that such mimicry entails intelligence. Though these steps
are fruitful in certain directions and have advanced automation, their singular
design focus renders them highly inefficient in achieving AGI. Which set of
requirements have to be met in the design of AGI? What are the limits in the
design of the artificial? Here, a careful examination of computation in
biological systems hints that evolutionary tinkering of contextual processing
of information enabled by a hierarchical architecture is the key to build AGI.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03417</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03417</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both neurobiological and environmental factors are known to play a role in
the origin of schizophrenia, but no model has been proposed that accounts for
both. This work presents a functional model of schizophrenia that merges
psychodynamic elements with ingredients borrowed from the theory of
psychological traumas, and evidences the interplay of traumatic experiences and
defective mental functions in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Our model
foresees that dissociation is a standard tool used by the mind to protect
itself from emotional pain. In case of repeated traumas, the mind learns to
adopt selective forms of dissociation to avoid pain without losing touch with
external reality. We conjecture that this process is defective in
schizophrenia, where dissociation is either too weak, giving rise to positive
symptoms, or too strong, causing negative symptoms.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Presynaptic LRP4 Promotes Synapse Number and Function of Excitatory CNS Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115907v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115907v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 preferentially localizes to excitatory neuron terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory) synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurons define non-myelinated axon segments by the regulation of galectin-4-containingaxon membrane domains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115758v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115758v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The mechanism underlying selective myelination of axons versus dendrites or neuronal somata relies on the expression of somatodendritic membrane myelination inhibitors (i.e. JAM2). However, axons still present long unmyelinated segments proposed to contribute to axonal plasticity and higher order brain functions. Why these segments remain unmyelinated is still an unresolved issue. The bifunctional lectin galectin-4 (Gal-4) organizes the transport of axon glycoproteins by binding to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNac) termini of N-glycans. We have shown that Gal-4 is sorted to segmental domains (G4Ds) along the axon surface, reminiscent of these long unmyelinated axon segments in cortical neurons. We report here that oligodendrocytes (OLGs) do not deposit myelin on Gal-4 covered surfaces or myelinate axonal G4Ds. In addition, Gal-4 interacts and co-localizes in G4Ds with contactin-1, a marker of non-myelinated nodes of Ranvier. Neither Gal-4 expression nor G4D dimensions are affected by myelin extracts or myelinating OLGs, but are reduced with neuron maturation. As in vitro, Gal-4 is consistently segregated from myelinated structures in the brain. Our data shape the novel concept that neurons establish and regulate axon membrane domains expressing Gal-4, the first inhibitor of myelination identified in axons, whose boundaries delineate myelination-incompetent axon segments along neuron development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Compensating for intersegmental dynamics across the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints during feedforward and feedback control</title>

	<description>Moving the arm is complicated by mechanical interactions that arise between limb segments. Such intersegmental dynamics cause torques applied at one joint to produce movement at multiple joints and, in turn, the only way to create single joint movement is by applying torques at multiple joints. Here, we investigated whether the nervous system accounts for intersegmental limb dynamics across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints during self-initiated reaching and when countering external mechanical perturbations. Our first experiment tested whether the timing and amplitude of shoulder muscle activity accounts for interaction torques produced during single-joint elbow movements from different elbow initial orientations and over a range of movement speeds. We found that shoulder muscle activity reliably preceded movement onset and elbow agonist activity, and was scaled to compensate for the magnitude of interaction torques arising because of forearm rotation. Our second experiment tested whether elbow muscles compensate for interaction torques introduced by single-joint wrist movements. We found that elbow muscle activity preceded movement onset and wrist agonist muscle activity, and thus the nervous system predicted interaction torques arising because of hand rotation. Our third and fourth experiments tested whether shoulder muscles compensate for interaction torques introduced by different hand orientations during self-initiated elbow movements and when countering mechanical perturbations that caused pure elbow motion. We found that the nervous system predicted the amplitude and direction of interaction torques, appropriately scaling the amplitude of shoulder muscle activity during self-initiated elbow movements and rapid feedback control. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the nervous system robustly accounts for intersegmental dynamics, and that the process is similar across the proximal to distal musculature of the arm as well as between feedforward (i.e., self-initiated) and feedback (i.e., reflexive) control.</description>

	<description>Considerable efforts are currently being devoted to enhance the speed, spatial resolution and the size of the 3D sample volumes in which calcium imaging methods can capture neuronal network activity in different model systems. In the mammalian brain, tissue scattering severely limits the use of parallel acquisition techniques such as wide-field imaging and, as a consequence, methods based on two-photon point-scanning (2PM) have become the method of choice. However, 2PM faces severe restrictions due to technical limitations such as scan speed, laser power, and those related to the fluorescent probes, calling for conceptually new approaches to enhance the performance of two-photon calcium imaging schemes. Here we provide a detailed quantitative evaluation and comparison of different excitation/detection modalities from the perspective of detecting neuronal activity that are based on different point-spread functions (PSF), laser repetition rates and sampling strategies. We demonstrate the conditions for which imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio are optimized for a given average power. Our results are based on numerical simulations which are informed by experimentally measured parameters and show that volumetric field of view and acquisition speed can be considerably improved compared to traditional 2PM schemes by a holistic optimization approach.</description>

	<description>Systems neuroscience is in a head-long rush to record from as many neurons at the same time as possible. As the brain computes and codes using neuron populations, it is hoped these data will uncover the fundamentals of neural computation. But with hundreds, thousands, or more simultaneously recorded neurons comes the inescapable problems of visualising, describing, and quantifying their interactions. Here I argue that network theory provides a set of scalable, analytical tools that already solve these problems. By treating neurons as nodes and their interactions as links, a single network can visualise and describe an arbitrarily large recording. I show that with this description we can quantify the effects of manipulating a neural circuit, track changes in population dynamics over time, and quantitatively define theoretical concepts of neural populations such as cell assemblies. Using network theory as a core part of analysing population recordings will thus provide both qualitative and quantitative advances to our understanding of neural computation.</description>

	<description>Sensory perception depends on the accurate representation of the external world by neuronal populations. Each neuron's contribution to a population code depends on its tuning preferences, but neuronal populations are heterogeneous: their spiking rate, spiking variability and tuning selectivity are all different. To understand how this heterogeneity impacts a neuron's contribution to the population code, we recorded responses to moving stimuli from motion-sensitive neurons in anaesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and trained linear decoders to discriminate direction using these responses. The relationship between a neuron's preferred direction and the discrimination boundary was the strongest predictor of its decoding weight, and highly direction selective neurons are the most useful in the population code. Millisecond-timescale changes in neuronal responses mean that optimal weights change rapidly; however, perceptual readouts do not have this fine-grained temporal flexibility, and must perform sub-optimal decoding at each point in time.</description>

	<description>The structural organisation of the brain can be characterised as a hierarchical ensemble of segregated modules linked by densely interconnected hub regions that facilitate distributed functional interactions. Disturbances to this network may be an important marker of abnormal development. Recently, several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), have been framed as disorders of connectivity but the full nature and timing of these disturbances remain unclear. In this study, we use non-negative matrix factorisation, a data-driven, multivariate approach, to model the structural network architecture of the brain as a set of superposed subnetworks, or network components. In an openly available dataset of 196 subjects scanned between 5 to 85 years we identify a set of robust and reliable subnetworks that develop in tandem with age and reflect both anatomically local and long-range, network hub connections. In a second experiment, we compare network components in a cohort of 51 high-functioning ASD adolescents to a group of age-matched controls. We identify a specific subnetwork representing an increase in local connection strength in the cingulate cortex in ASD (t=3.44, p&amp;lt;0.001). This work highlights possible long-term implications of alterations to the developmental trajectories of specific cortical subnetworks.</description>

Complex cognition and relatively large brains are distributed across various taxa, and many primarily verbal hypotheses exist to explain such diversity. Yet, mathematical approaches formalizing verbal hypotheses would help deepen the understanding of brain and cognition evolution. With this aim, we combine elements of life history and metabolic theories to formulate a metabolically explicit mathematical model for brain life history evolution. We assume that some of the brain’s energetic expense is due to production (learning) and maintenance (memory) of energy-extraction skills (or cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc.). We also assume that individuals use such skills to extract energy from the environment, and can allocate this energy to grow and maintain the body, including brain and reproductive tissues. The model can be used to ask what fraction of growth energy should be allocated at each age, given natural selection, to growing brain and other tissues under various biological settings. We apply the model to find uninvadable allocation strategies under a baseline setting (“me vs nature”), namely when energy-extraction challenges are environmentally determined and are overcome individually but possibly with maternal help, and use modern-human data to estimate model’s parameter values. The resulting uninvadable strategies yield predictions for brain and body mass throughout ontogeny and for the ages at maturity, adulthood, and brain growth arrest. We find that: (1) a me-vs-nature setting is enough to generate adult brain and body mass of ancient human scale and a sequence of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood stages; (2) large brains are favored by intermediately challenging environments, moderately effective skills, and metabolically expensive memory; and (3) adult skill is proportional to brain mass when metabolic costs of memory saturate the brain metabolic rate allocated to skills.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1K7EuImw5-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xf1bOVpQTFM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pulse-coupled model of excitable elements on heterogeneous sparse networks. (arXiv:1703.02564v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02564</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02564</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study a pulse-coupled dynamics of excitable elements in uncorrelated
scale-free networks. Regimes of self-sustained activity are found for
homogeneous and inhomogeneous couplings, in which the system displays a wide
variety of behaviors, including periodic and irregular global spiking signals,
as well as coherent oscillations, an unexpected form of synchronization. Our
numerical results also show that the properties of the population firing rate
depend on the size of the system, particularly its structure and average value
over time. However, a few straightforward dynamical and topological strategies
can be introduced to enhance or hinder these global behaviors, rendering a
scenario where signal control is attainable, which incorporates a basic
mechanism to turn off the dynamics permanently. As our main result, here we
present a framework to estimate, in the stationary state, the mean firing rate
over a long time window and to decompose the global dynamics into average
values of the inter-spike-interval of each connectivity group. Our approach
provides accurate predictions of these average quantities when the network
exhibits high heterogeneity, a remarkable finding that is not restricted
exclusively to the scale-free topology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Loss of brain inter-frequency hubs in Alzheimer's disease. (arXiv:1701.00096v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00096</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes alterations of brain network structure and
function. The latter consists of connectivity changes between oscillatory
processes at different frequency channels. We proposed a multi-layer network
approach to analyze multiple-frequency brain networks inferred from
magnetoencephalographic recordings during resting-states in AD subjects and
age-matched controls. Main results showed that brain networks tend to
facilitate information propagation across different frequencies, as measured by
the multi-participation coefficient (MPC). However, regional connectivity in AD
subjects was abnormally distributed across frequency bands as compared to
controls, causing significant decreases of MPC. This effect was mainly
localized in association areas and in the cingulate cortex, which acted, in the
healthy group, as a true inter-frequency hub. MPC values significantly
correlated with memory impairment of AD subjects, as measured by the total
recall score. Most predictive regions belonged to components of the
default-mode network that are typically affected by atrophy, metabolism
disruption and amyloid-beta deposition. We evaluated the diagnostic power of
the MPC and we showed that it led to increased classification accuracy (78.39%)
and sensitivity (91.11%). These findings shed new light on the brain functional
alterations underlying AD and provide analytical tools for identifying
multi-frequency neural mechanisms of brain diseases.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rules and mechanisms for efficient two-stage learning in neural circuits. (arXiv:1608.08040v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08040</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trial-and-error learning requires evaluating variable actions and reinforcing
successful variants. In songbirds, vocal exploration is induced by LMAN, the
output of a basal ganglia-circuit that also contributes a corrective bias to
the vocal output. This bias is gradually consolidated in RA, a motor cortex
analogue downstream of LMAN. We develop a new model of such two-stage learning.
Using stochastic gradient descent, we derive how the activity in 'tutor'
circuits (e.g., LMAN) should match plasticity mechanisms in 'student' circuits
(e.g., RA) to achieve efficient learning. We further describe a reinforcement
learning framework through which the tutor can build its teaching signal. We
show that mismatches between the tutor signal and the plasticity mechanism can
impair learning. Applied to birdsong, our results predict the temporal
structure of the corrective bias from LMAN given a plasticity rule in RA. Our
framework can be applied predictively to other paired brain areas showing
two-stage learning.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Decoding across sensory modalities reveals common supramodal signatures of conscious perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115535v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115535v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>An increasing number of studies point to the role of fronto-parietal brain structures in mediating conscious sensory experience. While a majority of studies have been performed in the visual modality, it is implicitly assumed that similar processes are involved in different sensory modalities. However, the existence of supramodal neural processes related to conscious perception has not been convincingly shown so far. In this study, we aim to directly address this issue by investigating whether neural correlates of conscious perception in one modality can predict conscious perception in a different modality. We presented participants with successive blocks of near-threshold tasks involving tactile, visual or auditory stimuli during the same magnetoencephalography (MEG) acquisition. Using decoding analysis in the post-stimulus period between sensory modalities, we uncovered supramodal spatio-temporal neural activity patterns predicting the presence of conscious perception of the feeble stimulation. Interestingly, these supramodal patterns included late activity in primary sensory regions not directly relevant to the task (e.g. neural activity in visual cortex predicting conscious perception of auditory near-threshold stimulation). Our findings reveal for the first time within one experiment a common signature of conscious access across modalities and illustrate the widespread broadcasting of neural representations, even into primary sensory processing regions.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115402v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>An essential step toward understanding neural circuits is linking their structure and their dynamics. In general, this relationship can be almost arbitrarily complex. Recent theoretical work has, however, begun to identify some broad principles underlying collective spiking activity in neural circuits. The first is that local features of network connectivity can be surprisingly effective in predicting global statistics of activity across a network. The second is that, for the important case of large networks with excitatory-inhibitory balance, correlated spiking persists or vanishes depending on the spatial scales of recurrent and feedforward connectivity. We close by showing how these ideas, together with plasticity rules, can help to close the loop between network structure and activity statistics.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115253v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Humans naturally group the world into coherent categories defined by membership rules. Rules can be learned implicitly by building stimulus-response associations using reinforcement learning (RL) or by using explicit reasoning. We tested if striatum, in which activation reliably scales with reward prediction error, would track prediction errors in a task that required explicit rule generation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a categorization task, we show that striatal responses to feedback scale with a surprise signal derived from a Bayesian rule-learning model. We also find that striatal feedback responses are inconsistent with RL prediction error and demonstrate that striatum and caudal inferior frontal sulcus (cIFS) are involved in updating the likelihood of discriminative rules. We conclude that the striatum, in cooperation with the cIFS, is involved in updating the values assigned to categorization rules, rather than representing reward prediction errors.</description>

	<description>The bionic eye - so long a dream of the future - is finally becoming a reality with retinal prostheses available to patients in the US and Europe. However, clinical experience with these implants has made it apparent that the vision restored by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. Consequently, the ability to learn to make use of this abnormal retinal input plays a critical role in whether or not some functional vision is successfully restored. The goal of the present review is to summarize the vast basic science literature on developmental and adult cortical plasticity with an emphasis on how this literature might relate to the field of sight recovery. We begin with formal definitions of cortical plasticity and perceptual learning. We then describe what is known, and what is unknown, about visual plasticity across the hierarchy of brain regions involved in visual processing, and across different stages of life. We close by discussing what is known about brain plasticity in sight restoration patients and discuss biological mechanisms that could be harnessed in future technologies to improve visual learning in these patients.</description>

	<description>Despite decades of research, visions of transforming neuropsychiatry through the development of brain imaging-based growth charts or lab tests have remained out of reach. In recent years, there is renewed enthusiasm about the prospect of achieving clinically useful tools capable of aiding the diagnosis and management of neuropsychiatric disorders. The present work explores the basis for this enthusiasm. We assert that there is no single advance that currently has the potential to drive the field of clinical brain imaging forward. Instead, there has been a constellation of advances that, if combined, could lead to the identification of objective brain imaging-based markers of illness. In particular, we focus on advances that are helping to: 1) elucidate the research agenda for biological psychiatry (e.g., neuroscience focus, precision medicine), 2) shift research models for clinical brain imaging (e.g., big data exploration, standardization), 3) break down research silos (e.g., open science, calls for reproducibility and transparency), and 4) improve imaging technologies and methods. While an arduous road remains ahead, these advances are repositioning the brain imaging community for long-term success.</description>

Mechanical coherence of cell layers is essential for epithelia to function as tissue barriers and to control active tissue dynamics during morphogenesis. RhoA signaling at adherens junctions plays a key role in this process by coupling cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion together with actomyosin contractility. Here we propose and analyze a mathematical model representing core interactions involved in the spatial localization of junctional RhoA signaling. We demonstrate how the interplay between biochemical signaling through positive feedback, combined with diffusion on the cell membrane and mechanical forces generated in the cortex, can determine the spatial distribution of RhoA signaling at cell-cell junctions. This dynamical mechanism relies on the balance between a propagating bistable signal that is opposed by an advective flow generated by an actomyosin stress gradient.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Evidence for an Evolutionarily Conserved Memory Coding Scheme in the Mammalian Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2795?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decades of research identify the hippocampal formation as central to memory storage and recall. Events are stored via distributed population codes, the parameters of which (e.g., sparsity and overlap) determine both storage capacity and fidelity. However, it remains unclear whether the parameters governing information storage are similar between species. Because episodic memories are rooted in the space in which they are experienced, the hippocampal response to navigation is often used as a proxy to study memory. Critically, recent studies in rodents that mimic the conditions typical of navigation studies in humans and nonhuman primates (i.e., virtual reality) show that reduced sensory input alters hippocampal representations of space. The goal of this study was to quantify this effect and determine whether there are commonalities in information storage across species. Using functional molecular imaging, we observe that navigation in virtual environments elicits activity in fewer CA1 neurons relative to real-world conditions. Conversely, comparable neuronal activity is observed in hippocampus region CA3 and the dentate gyrus under both conditions. Surprisingly, we also find evidence that the absolute number of neurons used to represent an experience is relatively stable between nonhuman primates and rodents. We propose that this convergence reflects an optimal ensemble size for episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; One primary factor constraining memory capacity is the sparsity of the engram, the proportion of neurons that encode a single experience. Investigating sparsity in humans is hampered by the lack of single-cell resolution and differences in behavioral protocols. Sparsity can be quantified in freely moving rodents, but extrapolating these data to humans assumes that information storage is comparable across species and is robust to restraint-induced reduction in sensory input. Here, we test these assumptions and show that species differences in brain size build memory capacity without altering the structure of the data being stored. Furthermore, sparsity in most of the hippocampus is resilient to reduced sensory information. This information is vital to integrating animal data with human imaging navigation studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Protect Against Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Dysfunction in Huntington's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2776?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2776?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional deregulation and changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) dysfunction, have been described in Huntington's disease (HD). We showed previously that the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) trichostatin A and sodium butyrate (SB) ameliorate mitochondrial function in cells expressing mutant huntingtin. In this work, we investigated the effect of HDACIs on the regulation of PDH activity in striatal cells derived from HD knock-in mice and YAC128 mice. Mutant cells exhibited decreased PDH activity and increased PDH E1alpha phosphorylation/inactivation, accompanied by enhanced protein levels of PDH kinases 1 and 3 (PDK1 and PDK3). Exposure to dichloroacetate, an inhibitor of PDKs, increased mitochondrial respiration and decreased production of reactive oxygen species in mutant cells, emphasizing PDH as an interesting therapeutic target in HD. Treatment with SB and sodium phenylbutyrate, another HDACI, recovered cell viability and overall mitochondrial metabolism in mutant cells. Exposure to SB also suppressed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) stabilization and decreased the transcription of the two most abundant PDK isoforms, PDK2 and PDK3, culminating in increased PDH activation in mutant cells. Concordantly, PDK3 knockdown improved mitochondrial function, emphasizing the role of PDK3 inactivation on the positive effects achieved by SB treatment. YAC128 mouse brain presented higher mRNA levels of PDK1–3 and PDH phosphorylation and decreased energy levels that were significantly ameliorated after SB treatment. Furthermore, enhanced motor learning and coordination were observed in SB-treated YAC128 mice. These results suggest that HDACIs, particularly SB, promote the activity of PDH in the HD brain, helping to counteract HD-related deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics and motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present work provides a better understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD) by showing that the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a promising therapeutic target. In particular, the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) may indirectly (through reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha stabilization) decrease the expression of the most abundant PDH kinase isoforms (e.g., PDK3), ameliorating PDH activity and mitochondrial metabolism and further affecting motor behavior in HD mice, thus constituting a promising agent for HD neuroprotective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Are There Multiple Kinds of Episodic Memory? An fMRI Investigation Comparing Autobiographical and Recognition Memory Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2764?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What brain regions underlie retrieval from episodic memory? The bulk of research addressing this question with fMRI has relied upon recognition memory for materials encoded within the laboratory. Another, less dominant tradition has used autobiographical methods, whereby people recall events from their lifetime, often after being cued with words or pictures. The current study addresses how the neural substrates of successful memory retrieval differed as a function of the targeted memory when the experimental parameters were held constant in the two conditions (except for instructions). Human participants studied a set of scenes and then took two types of memory test while undergoing fMRI scanning. In one condition (the picture memory test), participants reported for each scene (32 studied, 64 nonstudied) whether it was recollected from the prior study episode. In a second condition (the life memory test), participants reported for each scene (32 studied, 64 nonstudied) whether it reminded them of a specific event from their preexperimental lifetime. An examination of successful retrieval (yes responses) for recently studied scenes for the two test types revealed pronounced differences; that is, autobiographical retrieval instantiated with the life memory test preferentially activated the default mode network, whereas hits in the picture memory test preferentially engaged the parietal memory network as well as portions of the frontoparietal control network. When experimental cueing parameters are held constant, the neural underpinnings of successful memory retrieval differ when remembering life events and recently learned events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Episodic memory is often discussed as a solitary construct. However, experimental traditions examining episodic memory use very different approaches, and these are rarely compared to one another. When the neural correlates associated with each approach have been directly contrasted, results have varied considerably and at times contradicted each other. The present experiment was designed to match the two primary approaches to studying episodic memory in an unparalleled manner. Results suggest a clear separation of systems supporting memory as it is typically tested in the laboratory and memory as assessed under autobiographical retrieval conditions. These data provide neurobiological evidence that episodic memory is not a single construct, challenging the degree to which different experimental traditions are studying the same construct.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cell-Specific PKM Isoforms Contribute to the Maintenance of Different Forms of Persistent Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2746?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple kinase activations contribute to long-term synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism mediating long-term memory. The sensorimotor synapse of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; expresses different forms of long-term facilitation (LTF)—nonassociative and associative LTF—that require the timely activation of kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC). It is not known which PKC isoforms in the sensory neuron or motor neuron L7 are required to sustain each form of LTF. We show that different PKMs, the constitutively active isoforms of PKCs generated by calpain cleavage, in the sensory neuron and L7 are required to maintain each form of LTF. Different PKMs or calpain isoforms were blocked by overexpressing specific dominant-negative constructs in either presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons. Blocking either PKM Apl I in L7, or PKM Apl II or PKM Apl III in the sensory neuron 2 d after 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) treatment reversed persistent nonassociative LTF. In contrast, blocking either PKM Apl II or PKM Apl III in L7, or PKM Apl II in the sensory neuron 2 d after paired stimuli reversed persistent associative LTF. Blocking either classical calpain or atypical small optic lobe (SOL) calpain 2 d after 5-HT treatment or paired stimuli did not disrupt the maintenance of persistent LTF. Soon after 5-HT treatment or paired stimuli, however, blocking classical calpain inhibited the expression of persistent associative LTF, while blocking SOL calpain inhibited the expression of persistent nonassociative LTF. Our data suggest that different stimuli activate different calpains that generate specific sets of PKMs in each neuron whose constitutive activities sustain long-term synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Persistent synaptic plasticity contributes to the maintenance of long-term memory. Although various kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) contribute to the expression of long-term plasticity, little is known about how constitutive activation of specific kinase isoforms sustains long-term plasticity. This study provides evidence that the cell-specific activities of different PKM isoforms generated from PKCs by calpain-mediated cleavage maintain two forms of persistent synaptic plasticity, which are the cellular analogs of two forms of long-term memory. Moreover, we found that the activation of specific calpains depends on the features of the stimuli evoking the different forms of synaptic plasticity. Given the recent controversy over the role of PKM maintaining memory, these findings are significant in identifying roles of multiple PKMs in the retention of memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Resting-State Network Topology Differentiates Task Signals across the Adult Life Span</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2734?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain network connectivity differs across individuals. For example, older adults exhibit less segregated resting-state subnetworks relative to younger adults (Chan et al., 2014). It has been hypothesized that individual differences in network connectivity impact the recruitment of brain areas during task execution. While recent studies have described the spatial overlap between resting-state functional correlation (RSFC) subnetworks and task-evoked activity, it is unclear whether individual variations in the connectivity pattern of a brain area (topology) relates to its activity during task execution. We report data from 238 cognitively normal participants (humans), sampled across the adult life span (20–89 years), to reveal that RSFC-based network organization systematically relates to the recruitment of brain areas across two functionally distinct tasks (visual and semantic). The functional activity of brain areas (network nodes) were characterized according to their patterns of RSFC: nodes with relatively greater connections to nodes in their own functional system (&quot;non-connector&quot; nodes) exhibited greater activity than nodes with relatively greater connections to nodes in other systems (&quot;connector&quot; nodes). This &quot;activation selectivity&quot; was specific to those brain systems that were central to each of the tasks. Increasing age was accompanied by less differentiated network topology and a corresponding reduction in activation selectivity (or differentiation) across relevant network nodes. The results provide evidence that connectional topology of brain areas quantified at rest relates to the functional activity of those areas during task. Based on these findings, we propose a novel network-based theory for previous reports of the &quot;dedifferentiation&quot; in brain activity observed in aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Similar to other real-world networks, the organization of brain networks impacts their function. As brain network connectivity patterns differ across individuals, we hypothesized that individual differences in network connectivity would relate to differences in brain activity. Using functional MRI in a group of individuals sampled across the adult life span (20–89 years), we measured correlations at rest and related the functional connectivity patterns to measurements of functional activity during two independent tasks. Brain activity varied in relation to connectivity patterns revealed by large-scale network analysis. This relationship tracked the differences in connectivity patterns accompanied by older age, providing important evidence for a link between the topology of areal connectivity measured at rest and the functional recruitment of these areas during task performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventrolateral Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons Positively Regulate Food-Incentive, Goal-Directed Behavior Independently of D1 and D2 Selectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2723?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral striatum is involved in motivated behavior. Akin to the dorsal striatum, the ventral striatum contains two parallel pathways: the striatomesencephalic pathway consisting of dopamine receptor Type 1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) and the striatopallidal pathway consisting of D2-MSNs. These two genetically identified pathways are thought to encode opposing functions in motivated behavior. It has also been reported that D1/D2 genetic selectivity is not attributed to the anatomical discrimination of two pathways. We wanted to determine whether D1- and D2-MSNs in the ventral striatum functioned in an opposing manner as previous observations claimed, and whether D1/D2 selectivity corresponded to a functional segregation in motivated behavior of mice. To address this question, we focused on the lateral portion of ventral striatum as a region implicated in food-incentive, goal-directed behavior, and recorded D1 or D2-MSN activity by using a gene-encoded ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicator and by constructing a fiberphotometry system, and manipulated their activities via optogenetic inhibition during ongoing behaviors. We observed concurrent event-related compound Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations in ventrolateral D1- and D2-MSNs, especially at trial start cue-related and first lever press-related times. D1 or D2 selective optogenetic inhibition just after the trial start cue resulted in a reduction of goal-directed behavior, indicating a shared coding of motivated behavior by both populations at this time. Only D1-selective inhibition just after the first lever press resulted in the reduction of behavior, indicating D1-MSN-specific coding at that specific time. Our data did not support opposing encoding by both populations in food-incentive, goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; An opposing role of dopamine receptor Type 1 or Type 2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs) on striatum-mediated behaviors has been widely accepted. However, this idea has been questioned by recent reports. In the present study, we measured concurrent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity patterns of D1- and D2-MSNs in the ventrolateral striatum during food-incentive, goal-directed behavior in mice. According to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity patterns, we conducted timing-specific optogenetic inhibition of each type of MSN. We demonstrated that both D1- and D2-MSNs in the ventrolateral striatum commonly and positively encoded action initiation, whereas only D1-MSNs positively encoded sustained motivated behavior. These findings led us to reconsider the prevailing notion of a functional segregation of MSN activity in the ventral striatum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ARPP-16 Is a Striatal-Enriched Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulated by Microtubule-Associated Serine/Threonine Kinase 3 (Mast 3 Kinase)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2709?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ARPP-16 (cAMP-regulated phospho-protein of molecular weight 16 kDa) is one of several small acid-soluble proteins highly expressed in medium spiny neurons of striatum that are phosphorylated in response to dopamine acting via D1 receptor/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. We show here that ARPP-16 is also phosphorylated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 3 (MAST3 kinase), an enzyme of previously unknown function that is enriched in striatum. We find that ARPP-16 interacts directly with the scaffolding A subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP2A, and that phosphorylation of ARPP-16 at Ser46 by MAST3 kinase converts the protein into a selective inhibitor of B55α- and B56-containing heterotrimeric forms of PP2A. Ser46 of ARPP-16 is phosphorylated to a high basal stoichiometry in striatum, suggestive of basal inhibition of PP2A in striatal neurons. In support of this hypothesis, conditional knock-out of ARPP-16 in CaMKIIα::cre/floxed ARPP-16/19 mice results in dephosphorylation of a subset of PP2A substrates including phospho-Thr75-DARPP-32, phospho-T308-Akt, and phospho-T202/Y204-ERK. Conditional knock-out of ARPP-16/19 is associated with increased motivation measured on a progressive ratio schedule of food reinforcement, yet an attenuated locomotor response to acute cocaine. Our previous studies have shown that ARPP-16 is phosphorylated at Ser88 by PKA. Activation of PKA in striatal slices leads to phosphorylation of Ser88, and this is accompanied by marked dephosphorylation of Ser46. Together, these studies suggest that phospho-Ser46-ARPP-16 acts to basally control PP2A in striatal medium spiny neurons but that dopamine acting via PKA inactivates ARPP-16 leading to selective potentiation of PP2A signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We describe a novel mechanism of signal transduction enriched in medium spiny neurons of striatum that likely mediates effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine acting on these cells. We find that the protein ARPP-16, which is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons, acts as a selective inhibitor of certain forms of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP2A, when phosphorylated by the kinase, MAST3. Under basal conditions, ARPP-16 is phosphorylated by MAST3 to a very high stoichiometry. However, the actions of MAST3 are antagonized by dopamine and cAMP-regulated signaling leading to disinhibition of ARPP-16 and increased PP2A action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mouth and Voice: A Relationship between Visual and Auditory Preference in the Human Superior Temporal Sulcus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2697?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2697?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortex in and around the human posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is known to be critical for speech perception. The pSTS responds to both the visual modality (especially biological motion) and the auditory modality (especially human voices). Using fMRI in single subjects with no spatial smoothing, we show that visual and auditory selectivity are linked. Regions of the pSTS were identified that preferred visually presented moving mouths (presented in isolation or as part of a whole face) or moving eyes. Mouth-preferring regions responded strongly to voices and showed a significant preference for vocal compared with nonvocal sounds. In contrast, eye-preferring regions did not respond to either vocal or nonvocal sounds. The converse was also true: regions of the pSTS that showed a significant response to speech or preferred vocal to nonvocal sounds responded more strongly to visually presented mouths than eyes. These findings can be explained by environmental statistics. In natural environments, humans see visual mouth movements at the same time as they hear voices, while there is no auditory accompaniment to visual eye movements. The strength of a voxel's preference for visual mouth movements was strongly correlated with the magnitude of its auditory speech response and its preference for vocal sounds, suggesting that visual and auditory speech features are coded together in small populations of neurons within the pSTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans interacting face to face make use of auditory cues from the talker's voice and visual cues from the talker's mouth to understand speech. The human posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a brain region known to be important for speech perception, is complex, with some regions responding to specific visual stimuli and others to specific auditory stimuli. Using BOLD fMRI, we show that the natural statistics of human speech, in which voices co-occur with mouth movements, are reflected in the neural architecture of the pSTS. Different pSTS regions prefer visually presented faces containing either a moving mouth or moving eyes, but only mouth-preferring regions respond strongly to voices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Individual Differences in Resting Corticospinal Excitability Are Correlated with Reaction Time and GABA Content in Motor Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2686?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals differ in the intrinsic excitability of their corticospinal pathways and, perhaps more generally, their entire nervous system. At present, we have little understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences and how variation in intrinsic excitability relates to behavior. Here, we examined the relationship between individual differences in intrinsic corticospinal excitability, local cortical GABA levels, and reaction time (RT) in a group of 20 healthy human adults. We measured corticospinal excitability at rest with transcranial magnetic stimulation, local concentrations of basal GABA with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and RT with a behavioral task. All measurements were repeated in two separate sessions, and tests of reliability confirmed the presence of stable individual differences. There was a negative correlation between corticospinal excitability and RT, such that larger motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) measured at rest were associated with faster RTs. Interestingly, larger MEPs were associated with higher levels of GABA in M1, but not in three other cortical regions. Together, these results suggest that individuals with more excitable corticospinal pathways are faster to initiate planned responses and have higher levels of GABA within M1, possibly to compensate for a more excitable motor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study brings together physiological, behavioral, and neurochemical evidence to examine variability in the excitability of the human motor system. Previous work has focused on state-based factors (e.g., preparedness, uncertainty), with little attention given to the influence of inherent stable characteristics. Here, we examined how the excitability of the motor system relates to reaction time and the regional content of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Importantly, motor pathway excitability and GABA concentrations were measured at rest, outside a task context, providing assays of intrinsic properties of the individuals. Individuals with more excitable motor pathways had faster reaction times and, paradoxically, higher concentrations of GABA. We propose that greater GABA capacity in the motor cortex counteracts an intrinsically more excitable motor system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Motor Learning Enhances Use-Dependent Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2673?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2673?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor behaviors are shaped not only by current sensory signals but also by the history of recent experiences. For instance, repeated movements toward a particular target bias the subsequent movements toward that target direction. This process, called use-dependent plasticity (UDP), is considered a basic and goal-independent way of forming motor memories. Most studies consider movement history as the critical component that leads to UDP (Classen et al., 1998; Verstynen and Sabes, 2011). However, the effects of learning (i.e., improved performance) on UDP during movement repetition have not been investigated. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation in two experiments to assess plasticity changes occurring in the primary motor cortex after individuals repeated reinforced and nonreinforced actions. The first experiment assessed whether learning a skill task modulates UDP. We found that a group that successfully learned the skill task showed greater UDP than a group that did not accumulate learning, but made comparable repeated actions. The second experiment aimed to understand the role of reinforcement learning in UDP while controlling for reward magnitude and action kinematics. We found that providing subjects with a binary reward without visual feedback of the cursor led to increased UDP effects. Subjects in the group that received comparable reward not associated with their actions maintained the previously induced UDP. Our findings illustrate how reinforcing consistent actions strengthens use-dependent memories and provide insight into operant mechanisms that modulate plastic changes in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Performing consistent motor actions induces use-dependent plastic changes in the motor cortex. This plasticity reflects one of the basic forms of human motor learning. Past studies assumed that this form of learning is exclusively affected by repetition of actions. However, here we showed that success-based reinforcement signals could affect the human use-dependent plasticity (UDP) process. Our results indicate that learning augments and interacts with UDP. This effect is important to the understanding of the interplay between the different forms of motor learning and suggests that reinforcement is not only important to learning new behaviors, but can shape our subsequent behavior via its interaction with UDP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synchronous Infra-Slow Bursting in the Mouse Accessory Olfactory Bulb Emerge from Interplay between Intrinsic Neuronal Dynamics and Network Connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic neuronal activity of multiple frequency bands has been described in many brain areas and attributed to numerous brain functions. Among these, little is known about the mechanism and role of infra-slow oscillations, which have been demonstrated recently in the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Along with prolonged responses to stimuli and distinct network connectivity, they inexplicably affect the AOB processing of social relevant stimuli. Here, we show that assemblies of AOB mitral cells are synchronized by lateral interactions through chemical and electrical synapses. Using a network model, we demonstrate that the synchronous oscillations in these assemblies emerge from interplay between intrinsic membrane properties and network connectivity. As a consequence, the AOB network topology, in which each mitral cell receives input from multiple glomeruli, enables integration of chemosensory stimuli over extended time scales by interglomerular synchrony of infra-slow bursting. These results provide a possible functional significance for the distinct AOB physiology and topology. Beyond the AOB, this study presents a general model for synchronous infra-slow bursting in neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Infra-slow rhythmic neuronal activity with a very long (&amp;gt;10 s) duration has been described in many brain areas, but little is known about the role of this activity and the mechanisms that produce it. Here, we combine experimental and computational methods to show that synchronous infra-slow bursting activity in mitral cells of the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) emerges from interplay between intracellular dynamics and network connectivity. In this novel mechanism, slow intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics endow AOB mitral cells with a weak tendency to burst, which is further enhanced and stabilized by chemical and electrical synapses between them. Combined with the unique topology of the AOB network, infra-slow bursting enables integration and binding of multiple chemosensory stimuli over a prolonged time scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulation of Synaptic Amyloid-{beta} Generation through BACE1 Retrograde Transport in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2639?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides play a key role in synaptic damage and memory deficits in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormal accumulation of Aβ at nerve terminals leads to synaptic pathology and ultimately to neurodegeneration. β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the major neuronal β-secretase for Aβ generation. However, the mechanisms regulating BACE1 distribution in axons and β cleavage of APP at synapses remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal that dynein–Snapin-mediated retrograde transport regulates BACE1 trafficking in axons and APP processing at presynaptic terminals. BACE1 is predominantly accumulated within late endosomes at the synapses of AD-related mutant human APP (hAPP) transgenic (Tg) mice and patient brains. Defective retrograde transport by genetic ablation of &lt;i&gt;snapin&lt;/i&gt; in mice recapitulates late endocytic retention of BACE1 and increased APP processing at presynaptic sites. Conversely, overexpressing Snapin facilitates BACE1 trafficking and reduces synaptic BACE1 accumulation by enhancing the removal of BACE1 from distal AD axons and presynaptic terminals. Moreover, elevated Snapin expression via stereotactic hippocampal injections of adeno-associated virus particles in mutant hAPP Tg mouse brains decreases synaptic Aβ levels and ameliorates synapse loss, thus rescuing cognitive impairments associated with hAPP mice. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the complex regulation of BACE1 trafficking and presynaptic localization through Snapin-mediated dynein-driven retrograde axonal transport, thereby suggesting a potential approach of modulating Aβ levels and attenuating synaptic deficits in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) trafficking and synaptic localization significantly influence its β secretase activity and amyloid-β (Aβ) production. In AD brains, BACE1 is accumulated within dystrophic neurites, which is thought to augment Aβ-induced synaptotoxicity by Aβ overproduction. However, it remains largely unknown whether axonal transport regulates synaptic APP processing. Here, we demonstrate that Snapin-mediated retrograde transport plays a critical role in removing BACE1 from presynaptic terminals toward the soma, thus reducing synaptic Aβ production. Adeno-associated virus–mediated Snapin overexpression in the hippocampus of mutant hAPP mice significantly decreases synaptic Aβ levels, attenuates synapse loss, and thus rescues cognitive deficits. Our study uncovers a new pathway that controls synaptic APP processing by enhancing axonal BACE1 trafficking, thereby advancing our fundamental knowledge critical for ameliorating Aβ-linked synaptic pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identity-Specific Reward Representations in Orbitofrontal Cortex Are Modulated by Selective Devaluation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2627?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behavior is sensitive to the current value of expected outcomes. This requires independent representations of specific rewards, which have been linked to orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) function. However, the mechanisms by which the human brain updates specific goals on the fly, and translates those updates into choices, have remained unknown. Here we implemented selective devaluation of appetizing food odors in combination with pattern-based neuroimaging and a decision-making task. We found that in a hungry state, participants chose to smell high-intensity versions of two value-matched food odor rewards. After eating a meal corresponding to one of the two odors, participants switched choices toward the low intensity of the sated odor but continued to choose the high intensity of the nonsated odor. This sensory-specific behavioral effect was mirrored by pattern-based changes in fMRI signal in lateral posterior OFC, where specific reward identity representations were altered after the meal for the sated food odor but retained for the nonsated counterpart. In addition, changes in functional connectivity between the OFC and general value coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) predicted individual differences in satiety-related choice behavior. These findings demonstrate how flexible representations of specific rewards in the OFC are updated by devaluation, and how functional connections to vmPFC reflect the current value of outcomes and guide goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for goal-directed behavior. A recent proposal is that OFC fulfills this function by representing a variety of state and task variables (&quot;cognitive maps&quot;), including a conjunction of expected reward identity and value. Here we tested how identity-specific representations of food odor reward are updated by satiety. We found that fMRI pattern-based signatures of reward identity in lateral posterior OFC were modulated after selective devaluation, and that connectivity between this region and general value coding ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) predicted choice behavior. These results provide evidence for a mechanism by which devaluation modulates a cognitive map of expected reward in OFC and thereby alters general value signals in vmPFC to guide goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nerve-Specific Input Modulation to Spinal Neurons during a Motor Task in the Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2612?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2612?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If not properly regulated, the large amount of reafferent sensory signals generated by our own movement could destabilize the CNS. We investigated how input from peripheral nerves to spinal cord is modulated during behavior. We chronically stimulated the deep radial nerve (DR; proprioceptive, wrist extensors), the median nerve (M; mixed, wrist flexors and palmar skin) and the superficial radial nerve (SR; cutaneous, hand dorsum) while four monkeys performed a delayed wrist flexion–extension task. Spinal neurons putatively receiving direct sensory input were defined based on their evoked response latency following nerve stimulation. We compared the influence of behavior on the evoked response (responsiveness to a specific peripheral input) and firing rate of 128 neuron-nerve pairs based on their source nerve. Firing rate increased during movement regardless of source nerve, whereas evoked response modulation was strikingly nerve-dependent. In SR (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 47) and M (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 27) neurons (cutaneous or mixed input), the evoked response was suppressed during wrist flexion and extension. In contrast, in DR neurons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54, pure proprioceptive input), the evoked response was facilitated exclusively during movements corresponding to the contraction of DR spindle-bearing muscles (i.e., wrist extension). Furthermore, modulations of firing rate and evoked response were uncorrelated in SR and M neurons, whereas they tended to be positively comodulated in DR neurons. Our results suggest that proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs to the spinal cord are modulated differently during voluntary movements, suggesting a refined gating mechanism of sensory signals according to behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Voluntary movements produce copious sensory signals, which may overwhelm the CNS if not properly regulated. This regulation is called &quot;gating&quot; and occurs at several levels of the CNS. To evaluate the specificity of sensory gating, we investigated how different sources of somatosensory inputs to the spinal cord were modulated while monkeys performed wrist movements. We recorded activity from spinal neurons that putatively received direct connections from peripheral nerves while stimulating their source nerves, and measured the evoked responses. Whereas cutaneous inputs were suppressed regardless of the type of movement, muscular inputs were specifically facilitated during relevant movements. We conclude that, even at the spinal level, sensory gating is a refined and input-specific process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temperature Manipulation in Songbird Brain Implicates the Premotor Nucleus HVC in Birdsong Syntax</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2600?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Variable motor sequences of animals are often structured and can be described by probabilistic transition rules between action elements. Examples include the songs of many songbird species such as the Bengalese finch, which consist of stereotypical syllables sequenced according to probabilistic rules (song syntax). The neural mechanisms behind such rules are poorly understood. Here, we investigate where the song syntax is encoded in the brain of the Bengalese finch by rapidly and reversibly manipulating the temperature in the song production pathway. Cooling the premotor nucleus HVC (proper name) slows down the song tempo, consistent with the idea that HVC controls moment-to-moment timings of acoustic features in the syllables. More importantly, cooling HVC alters the transition probabilities between syllables. Cooling HVC reduces the number of repetitions of long-repeated syllables and increases the randomness of syllable sequences. In contrast, cooling the downstream motor area RA (robust nucleus of the acropallium), which is critical for singing, does not affect the song syntax. Unilateral cooling of HVC shows that control of syllables is mostly lateralized to the left HVC, whereas transition probabilities between the syllables can be affected by cooling HVC in either hemisphere to varying degrees. These results show that HVC is a key site for encoding song syntax in the Bengalese finch. HVC is thus involved both in encoding timings within syllables and in sequencing probabilistic transitions between syllables. Our finding suggests that probabilistic selections and fine-grained timings of action elements can be integrated within the same neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many animal behaviors such as birdsong consist of variable sequences of discrete actions. Where and how the probabilistic rules of such sequences are encoded in the brain is poorly understood. We locally and reversibly cooled brain areas in songbirds during singing. Mild cooling of area HVC in the Bengalese finch brain—a premotor area homologous to the mammalian premotor cortex—alters the statistics of the syllable sequences, suggesting that HVC is critical for birdsong sequences. HVC is also known for controlling moment-to-moment timings within syllables. Our results show that timing and probabilistic sequencing of actions can share the same neural circuits in local brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acid-Sensing Ion Channels Activated by Evoked Released Protons Modulate Synaptic Transmission at the Mouse Calyx of Held Synapse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2589?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2589?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) regulate synaptic activities and play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that these channels can be activated in neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory system in the CNS. A drop in extracellular pH induces transient inward ASIC currents (I&lt;sub&gt;ASIC&lt;/sub&gt;s) in postsynaptic MNTB neurons from wild-type mice. The inhibition of I&lt;sub&gt;ASIC&lt;/sub&gt;s by psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1) and the absence of these currents in knock-out mice for ASIC-1a subunit (ASIC1a&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) suggest that homomeric ASIC-1as are mediating these currents in MNTB neurons. Furthermore, we detect ASIC1a-dependent currents during synaptic transmission, suggesting an acidification of the synaptic cleft due to the corelease of neurotransmitter and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from synaptic vesicles. These currents are capable of eliciting action potentials in the absence of glutamatergic currents. A significant characteristic of these homomeric ASIC-1as is their permeability to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Activation of ASIC-1a in MNTB neurons by exogenous H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; induces an increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the activation of postsynaptic ASIC-1as during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the presynaptic nerve terminal leads to a PcTx1-sensitive increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in MNTB neurons, which is independent of glutamate receptors and is absent in neurons from ASIC1a&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. During HFS, the lack of functional ASICs in synaptic transmission results in an enhanced short-term depression of glutamatergic EPSCs. These results strongly support the hypothesis of protons as neurotransmitters and demonstrate that presynaptic released protons modulate synaptic transmission by activating ASIC-1as at the calyx of Held–MNTB synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The manuscript demonstrates that postsynaptic neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body at the mouse calyx of Held synapse express functional homomeric Acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC-1as) that can be activated by protons (coreleased with neurotransmitter from acidified synaptic vesicles). These ASIC-1as contribute to the generation of postsynaptic currents and, more relevant, to calcium influx, which could be involved in the modulation of presynaptic transmitter release. Inhibition or deletion of ASIC-1a leads to enhanced short-term depression, demonstrating that they are concerned with short-term plasticity of the synapse. ASICs represent a widespread communication system with unique properties. We expect that our experiments will have an impact in the neurobiology field and will spread in areas related to neuronal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Predictors of Decisions to Cognitively Control Emotion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deciding to control emotional responses is a fundamental means of responding to environmental challenges, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that predict the outcome of such decisions. We used fMRI to test whether human brain responses during initial viewing of negative images could be used to predict decisions to regulate affective responses to those images. Our results revealed the following: (1) decisions to regulate were more frequent in individuals exhibiting higher average levels of activity within the amygdala and regions of PFC known a priori to be involved in the cognitive control of emotion and (2) within-person expression of a distributed brain pattern associated with regulating emotion predicted choosing to regulate responses to particular stimuli beyond the predictive value of stimulus intensity or self-reports of emotion. These results demonstrate the behavioral relevance of variability in brain responses to aversive stimuli and provide a model that leverages this variability to predict behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Everyone experiences stressors, but how we respond to them can range from protracted disability to resilience and growth. One key process underlying this variability is the agentic decision to exert control over emotional responses. We present an fMRI-based model predicting decisions to control emotion, finding that activity in brain regions associated with the generation and regulation of emotion was predictive of which people choose to regulate frequently and a distributed brain pattern associated with regulating emotion was predictive of which stimuli regulation was chosen. These brain variables predicted future decisions to regulate emotion beyond what could be predicted from stimulus and self-report variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diencephalic Size Is Restricted by a Novel Interplay Between GCN5 Acetyltransferase Activity and Retinoic Acid Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2565?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/10/2565?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diencephalic defects underlie an array of neurological diseases. Previous studies have suggested that retinoic acid (RA) signaling is involved in diencephalic development at late stages of embryonic development, but its roles and mechanisms of action during early neural development are still unclear. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking enzymatic activity of the acetyltransferase GCN5 ((&lt;i&gt;Gcn5&lt;sup&gt;hat/hat&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)), which were previously characterized with respect to their exencephalic phenotype, exhibit significant diencephalic expansion, decreased diencephalic RA signaling, and increased diencephalic WNT and SHH signaling. Using a variety of molecular biology techniques in both cultured neuroepithelial cells treated with a GCN5 inhibitor and forebrain tissue from (&lt;i&gt;Gcn5&lt;sup&gt;hat/hat&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) embryos, we demonstrate that GCN5, RARα/, and the poorly characterized protein TACC1 form a complex in the nucleus that binds specific retinoic acid response elements in the absence of RA. Furthermore, RA triggers GCN5-mediated acetylation of TACC1, which results in dissociation of TACC1 from retinoic acid response elements and leads to transcriptional activation of RA target genes. Intriguingly, RA signaling defects caused by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; inhibition of GCN5 can be rescued through RA-dependent mechanisms that require RARβ. Last, we demonstrate that the diencephalic expansion and transcriptional defects seen in (&lt;i&gt;Gcn5&lt;sup&gt;hat/hat&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) mutants can be rescued with gestational RA supplementation, supporting a direct link between GCN5, TACC1, and RA signaling in the developing diencephalon. Together, our studies identify a novel, nonhistone substrate for GCN5 whose modification regulates a previously undescribed, tissue-specific mechanism of RA signaling that is required to restrict diencephalic size during early forebrain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Changes in diencephalic size and shape, as well as SNPs associated with retinoic acid (RA) signaling-associated genes, have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms that regulate diencephalic morphogenesis and the involvement of RA signaling in this process are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a novel role of the acetyltransferase GCN5 in a previously undescribed mechanism of RA signaling in the developing forebrain that is required to maintain the appropriate size of the diencephalon. Together, our experiments identify a novel nonhistone substrate of GCN5, highlight an essential role for both GCN5 and RA signaling in early diencephalic development, and elucidate a novel molecular regulatory mechanism for RA signaling that is specific to the developing forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural and Functional Cortical Connectivity Mediating Cross Education of Motor Function</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-education (CE) is the process whereby training with one limb leads to subsequent improvement in performance by the opposite untrained limb. We used multimodal neuroimaging in humans to investigate the mediating neural mechanisms by relating quantitative estimates of functional and structural cortical connectivity to individual levels of interlimb transfer. Resting-state (rs)-fMRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) scans were undertaken before unilateral ballistic wrist flexion training. The rs-fMRI sequence was repeated immediately afterward. The increase in performance of the untrained limb was 83.6% of that observed for the trained limb and significantly greater than that of a control group who undertook no training. Functional connectivity in the resting motor network between right and left supplementary motor areas (SMA) was elevated after training. These changes were not, however, correlated with individual levels of transfer. Analysis of the DWI data using constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography indicated that fractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density in tracts connecting bilateral SMA were negatively correlated with and predictive of transfer. The findings suggest that interhemispheric interactions between bilateral SMA play an instrumental role in CE and that the structural integrity of the connecting white matter pathways influences the level of transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Strength or skill training with one limb also brings about improvements in the performance of the opposite, untrained limb. This phenomenon, termed cross-education (CE), has obvious potential for the rehabilitation of functional capacity that has been lost through brain insult or musculoskeletal injury. The neural mechanisms that give rise to CE are, however, poorly understood. We used a combination of neuroimaging methods to investigate the pathways in the human brain that mediate CE. We determined that the supplementary motor area (SMA) plays an important role in the interlimb transfer of performance gains and demonstrate that the quality of the white matter fibers connecting right and left SMA predicts the benefit that an individual derives from CE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess the possibility of using a noninvasive screening method for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis by means of abdominal fat ultrasonography. Quantitative analysis of ultrasound B-mode images demonstrated a significant increase in mean echogenicity and a loss of the normal structure of the layers of fat tissue in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (n = 19). The ultrasound features of the fat tissue and the degree of amyloid deposition seen histopathologically showed a significant correlation. These results suggest that abdominal fat ultrasonography may be a valuable method for screening for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A quantum dynamic belief decision making model. (arXiv:1703.02386v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sure thing principle and the law of total probability are basic laws in
classic probability theory. A disjunction fallacy leads to the violation of
these two classical probability laws. In this paper, a new quantum dynamic
belief decision making model based on quantum dynamic modelling and
Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is proposed to address this issue and
model the real human decision-making process. Some mathematical techniques are
borrowed from quantum mathematics. Generally, belief and action are two parts
in a decision making process. The uncertainty in belief part is represented by
a superposition of certain states. The uncertainty in actions is represented as
an extra uncertainty state. The interference effect is produced due to the
entanglement between beliefs and actions. Basic probability assignment (BPA) of
decisions is generated by quantum dynamic modelling. Then BPA of the extra
uncertain state and an entanglement degree defined by an entropy function named
Deng entropy are used to measure the interference effect. Compared the existing
model, the number of free parameters is less in our model. Finally, a classical
categorization decision-making experiment is illustrated to show the
effectiveness of our model.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The variational Laplace approach to approximate Bayesian inference. (arXiv:1703.02089v1 [stat.ME])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02089</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02089</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Variational approaches to approximate Bayesian inference provide very
efficient means of performing parameter estimation and model selection. Among
these, so-called variational-Laplace or VL schemes rely on Gaussian
approximations to posterior densities on model parameters. In this note, we
review the main variants of VL approaches, that follow from considering
nonlinear models of continuous and/or categorical data. En passant, we also
derive a few novel theoretical results that complete the portfolio of existing
analyses of variational Bayesian approaches, including investigations of their
asymptotic convergence. We also suggest practical ways of extending existing VL
approaches to hierarchical generative models that include (e.g., precision)
hyperparameters.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Direct White Matter Bundle Segmentation using Stacked U-Nets. (arXiv:1703.02036v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02036</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The state-of-the-art method for automatically segmenting white matter bundles
in diffusion-weighted MRI is tractography in conjunction with streamline
cluster selection. This process involves long chains of processing steps which
are not only computationally expensive but also complex to setup and tedious
with respect to quality control. Direct bundle segmentation methods treat the
task as a traditional image segmentation problem. While they so far did not
deliver competitive results, they can potentially mitigate many of the
mentioned issues. We present a novel supervised approach for direct tract
segmentation that shows major performance gains. It builds upon a stacked U-Net
architecture which is trained on manual bundle segmentations from Human
Connectome Project subjects. We evaluate our approach \textit{in vivo} as well
as \textit{in silico} using the ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge phantom
dataset. We achieve human segmentation performance and a major performance gain
over previous pipelines. We show how the learned spatial priors efficiently
guide the segmentation even at lower image qualities with little quality loss.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Statistical mechanics of unsupervised feature learning in a restricted Boltzmann machine with binary synapses. (arXiv:1612.01717v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Revealing hidden features in unlabeled data is called unsupervised feature
learning, which plays an important role in pretraining a deep neural network.
Here we provide a statistical mechanics analysis of the unsupervised learning
in a restricted Boltzmann machine with binary synapses. A message passing
equation to infer the hidden feature is derived, and furthermore, variants of
this equation are analyzed. A statistical analysis by replica theory describes
the thermodynamic properties of the model. Our analysis confirms an entropy
crisis preceding the non-convergence of the message passing equation,
suggesting a discontinuous phase transition as a key characteristic of the
restricted Boltzmann machine. Continuous phase transition is also confirmed
depending on the embedded feature strength in the data. The mean-field result
under the replica symmetric assumption agrees with that obtained by running
message passing algorithms on single instances of finite sizes. Interestingly,
in an approximate Hopfield model, the entropy crisis is absent, and a
continuous phase transition is observed instead. We also develop an iterative
equation to infer the hyper-parameter (temperature) hidden in the data, which
in physics corresponds to iteratively imposing Nishimori condition. Our study
provides insights towards understanding the thermodynamic properties of the
restricted Boltzmann machine learning, and moreover important theoretical basis
to build simplified deep networks.

	<description>Neurosecretory centres in animal brains use peptidergic signalling to influence physiology and behaviour. Understanding neurosecretory centre function requires mapping cell types, synapses, and peptidergic networks. Here we use electron microscopy and gene expression mapping to analyse the synaptic and peptidergic connectome of an entire neurosecretory centre. We mapped 78 neurosecretory neurons in the brain of larval Platynereis dumerilii, a marine annelid. These neurons form an anterior neurosecretory organ expressing many neuropeptides, including hypothalamic peptide orthologues and their receptors. Analysis of peptide-receptor pairs revealed sparsely connected networks linking specific neuronal subsets. We experimentally analysed one peptide-receptor pair and found that a neuropeptide can couple neurosecretory and synaptic brain signalling. Our study uncovered extensive non-synaptic signalling within a neurosecretory centre and its connection to the synaptic brain.</description>

	<description>Computational modelling of behaviour can identify neurocognitive processes which are not measurable using standard analyses and may thus be used to characterise novel psychiatric treatment targets. For example, computational work demonstrates that informative events, those which improve prediction of future outcomes, are preferentially processed. This suggests that the cognitive biases towards negative events which are causally associated with depression arise because patients overestimate how informative these events are. In this study we assess whether the estimated information content of positive relative to negative events is a viable treatment target, testing whether participants maintain separate valence specific estimates, whether altering the volatility of experienced outcomes modifies these estimates and their association with a physiological marker, central norepinepheric activity. 30 non-clinical participants completed a learning task in which choices led to both wins and losses. The information content of the outcomes was manipulated by varying their volatility. Computational modelling of participant choice was used to estimate learning rate and pupilometry data was collected as a measure of norepinepheric function. Participants independently altered the learning rates used for win and loss outcomes to reflect how informative the outcomes were. Pupil dilation was greater for informative than non-informative loss outcomes and was associated with participants loss learning rate. These results characterise a computationally defined potential treatment target for depression. The target was associated with norepinepheric function and was engaged by modifying the volatility of experienced events. By identifying novel treatment targets computational approaches may spur the development of a new generation of psychiatric treatments.</description>

	<description>Detection of pathogens by plants is mediated by intracellular nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor proteins. NLR proteins are defined by their stereotypical multidomain structure: an N-terminal Toll–interleukin receptor (TIR) or coiled-coil (CC) domain, a central nucleotide-binding (NB) domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR). The plant innate immune system...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/ROuMQO2Qr58&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The self-association of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor/resistance protein (TIR) domains has been implicated in signaling in plant and animal immunity receptors. Structure-based studies identified different TIR-domain dimerization interfaces required for signaling of the plant nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) L6 from flax and disease resistance protein RPS4 from Arabidopsis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: HNCcorr: A Novel Combinatorial Approach for Cell Identification in Calcium-Imaging Movies. (arXiv:1703.01999v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging has emerged as a workhorse method in neuroscience to
investigate patterns of neuronal activity. Instrumentation to acquire calcium
imaging movies has rapidly progressed and has become standard across labs.
Still, algorithms to automatically detect and extract activity signals from
calcium imaging movies are highly variable from~lab~to~lab and more advanced
algorithms are continuously being developed. Here we present HNCcorr, a novel
algorithm for cell identification in calcium imaging movies based on
combinatorial optimization. The algorithm identifies cells by finding distinct
groups of highly similar pixels in correlation space, where a pixel is
represented by the vector of correlations to a set of other pixels. The HNCcorr
algorithm achieves the best known results for the cell identification benchmark
of Neurofinder, and guarantees an optimal solution to the underlying
deterministic optimization model resulting in a transparent mapping from input
data to outcome.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01842</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a promising method to analyze
high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets while taking into account both the
spatial and functional dependencies between brain signals. In the present work,
we apply GSP with dimensionality reduction techniques to decode brain activity
from real and simulated fMRI datasets. We introduce seven graphs obtained from
a) geometric structure and/or b) functional connectivity between brain areas at
rest and compare them when performing dimension reduction for classification.
We show that mixed graphs using both a) and b) offer the best performance. We
also show that graph sampling methods works better than classical dimension
reduction methods including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent
Component Analysis (ICA).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Computational Model of Systems Memory Reconsolidation and Extinction. (arXiv:1703.01357v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01357</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01357</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian brain newly acquired memories are dependent on the
hippocampus for maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are taken
over by the neocortex through a process called memory consolidation. Thus,
whereas recent memories are likely to be disrupted in the event of hippocampal
damage, older memories are less vulnerable. However, if a consolidated memory
is reactivated by a reminder, it can temporarily return to a
hippocampus-dependent state. This phenomenon is known as memory
reconsolidation. Here, we present an artificial neural-network model that
captures memory consolidation and reconsolidation, as well as the related
phenomena of memory extinction, spontaneous recovery and trace dominance. The
model provides a novel explanation of trace dominance, the competition between
reconsolidation and extinction, from which we derive two predictions that could
be tested in future experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence research to a great degree focuses on the brain and
behaviors that the brain generates. But the brain, an extremely complex
structure resulting from millions of years of evolution, can be viewed as a
solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. The
environment generates signals that produce sensory events within an organism.
Building an internal spatial and temporal model of the environment allows an
organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. Higher intelligence might
be the ability to process information coming from a larger extent of
space-time. In keeping with nature's penchant for extending rather than
replacing, the purpose of the mammalian neocortex might then be to record
events from distant reaches of space and time and render them, as though yet
near and present, to the older, deeper brain whose instinctual roles have
changed little over eons. Here this notion is embodied in a model called
morphognosis (morpho = shape and gnosis = knowledge). Its basic structure is a
pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of the pyramid
are the most recent and nearby events. Receding from the apex are less recent
and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a
structure of progressively larger chunks of space-time knowledge. A set of
morphognostics forms long-term memories that are learned by exposure to the
environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the
morphognosis model, using a simulated organism that learns to forage in its
world for food, build a nest, and play the game of Pong.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes a new neuroimaging analysis toolbox that allows for the
modeling of nonlinear effects at the voxel level, overcoming limitations of
methods based on linear models like the GLM. We illustrate its features using a
relevant example in which distinct nonlinear trajectories of Alzheimer's
disease related brain atrophy patterns were found across the full biological
spectrum of the disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Accounting for the Complex Hierarchical Topology of EEG Functional Connectivity in Network Binarisation. (arXiv:1610.06360v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06360</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06360</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Research into network analysis of brain function faces a
methodological challenge in selecting an appropriate threshold to binarise edge
weights. Such binarisation should take into account the complex hierarchical
structure found in functional connectivity. We explore the density range
suitable for such structure and provide a comparison of state-of-the-art
binarisation techniques including the recently proposed Cluster-Span Threshold
(CST).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We compare CST networks with weighted networks, minimum spanning
trees, union of shortest path graphs and arbitrary proportional thresholds. We
test these techniques on weighted complex hierarchy models by contrasting model
realisations with small parametric differences. We also test the robustness of
these techniques to random and targeted topological attacks. Simulated results
are confirmed with the analysis of three relevant EEG datasets: eyes open and
closed resting states; visual short-term memory tasks; and resting state
Alzheimer's disease with a healthy control group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The CST consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art binarisation
methods for topological accuracy and robustness in both synthetic and real
data. In fact, it proves near maximal for distinguishing differences when
compared with arbitrary proportional thresholding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Complex hierarchical topology requires a medium-density range
binarisation solution, such as the CST.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance: We provide insights into how the complex hierarchical structure
of functional networks is best revealed in medium density ranges and how it
safeguards against targeted attacks. We explore the effects of network size and
density on the topological accuracy of binarised networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synchronization of oscillators through time-shifted common inputs. (arXiv:1609.08320v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08320</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08320</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Shared upstream dynamical processes are frequently the source of common
inputs in various physical and biological systems. However, due to finite
signal transmission speeds and differences in the distance to the source, time
shifts between otherwise common inputs are unavoidable. Since common inputs can
be a source of correlation between the elements of multi-unit dynamical
systems, regardless of whether these elements are directly connected with one
another or not, it is of importance to understand their impact on
synchronization. As a canonical model that is representative for a variety of
different dynamical systems, we study limit-cycle oscillators that are driven
by stochastic time-shifted common inputs. We show that if the oscillators are
coupled, time shifts in stochastic common inputs do not simply shift the
distribution of the phase differences, but rather the distribution actually
changes as a result. The best synchronization is therefore achieved at a
precise intermediate value of the time shift, which is due to a resonance-like
effect with the most probable phase difference that is determined by the
deterministic dynamics.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Estrogen receptor alpha is required in GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, neurons to masculinize the brain</title>

	<description>Masculinization of the rodent brain is driven by estrogen signaling during a perinatal critical period. Genetic deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1/ER) results in altered hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis signaling and a dramatic reduction of male sexual and territorial behaviors. However, the requirement of ER function in masculinizing distinct classes of neurons, and if these populations mediate components of male-typical behavior, remains unexplored. We deleted ER in excitatory or inhibitory neurons using either a Vglut2 or Vgat driver and assessed male behaviors. We find that Vglut2-Cre;Esr1lox/lox mutant males lack ER in the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and posterior ventral portion of the medial amygdala (MePV). These mutants recapitulate the increased serum testosterone levels seen with constitutive ER deletion, but have none of the behavioral deficits. In contrast, Vgat-Cre;Esr1lox/lox males with substantial ER deletion in inhibitory neurons, including those of the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr), posterior dorsal MeA (MePD), and medial preoptic area (MPOA) have normal testosterone levels, but display alterations in mating and territorial behaviors. These mutants also show demasculinized expression of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor beta (Esr2). Our results demonstrate that ER masculinizes GABAergic neurons that gate the display of male-typical behaviors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Classification of brain pericytes based on cell structure, location, and {alpha}-smooth muscle actin content</title>

	<description>Smooth muscle cells and pericytes, together called mural cells, coordinate numerous vascular functions. Canonically, smooth muscle cells are ring-shaped and cover arterioles with circumferential processes, whereas pericytes extend thin processes that run longitudinally along capillaries. Nearly a century ago, Zimmerman described mural cells with mixed features of smooth muscle cells and pericytes, which he termed transitional pericytes. Recent studies suggest that transitional pericytes are critically positioned to regulate cerebral blood flow, but there remains considerable confusion on how to identify and categorize them. Here, we use metrics of cell morphology, vascular territory, and -smooth muscle actin expression to test the hypothesis that transitional pericytes can be distinguished from canonical smooth muscle cells and pericytes. We first imaged fluorescently-labeled mural cells in large volumes of optically-cleared mouse cortex to elucidate the location of potential transitional pericytes. Subsequent investigation of isolated mural cells revealed that one type of transitional pericyte, which we called ensheathing pericytes, could be reliably distinguished. Ensheathing pericytes possessed protruding ovoid cell bodies and had elongated processes that encircled the vessel lumen. They were rich in -smooth muscle actin and occupied proximal branches of penetrating arteriole offshoots. We provide guidelines to identify ensheathing pericytes and other mural cell types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: INCLUSION CRITERIA UPDATE OF THE INTRALUMINAL ISCHEMIC MODEL IN RAT FOR PRECLINICAL STUDIES</title>

	<description>A proper occlusion of the medial cerebral artery (MCA) determined by laser Doppler during cerebral ischemia in rat models is an important inclusion criteria in experimental studies. However, a successful occlusion of the artery does not always guarantee a reproducible infarct volume which is critical to validate the efficacy of new protective drugs. In this study, we have compared the variability of infarct size in ischemic animals when the artery occlusion is monitored with laser Doppler alone and in combination with MRI during artery occlusion. Infarct volume determined at 24 hours was compared between animals with laser Doppler monitoring alone and in combination with MR angiography (MRA) and diffusion weighted images (DWI). Twenty-eight animals presented a successful occlusion and reperfusion determined by Doppler monitoring with an infarct size at 24 hours of 16.71 {+/-} 11.58%. However, when artery occlusion and infarct damage were analyzed in these animals by MRA and DWI, 15 animals were excluded and only 13 animals were included based on Doppler and MRI inclusion criteria, with an infarct size of 21.65 {+/-} 6.15% at 24 hours. These results show that laser Doppler monitoring is needed but not enough to guarantee a reproducible infarct volume in rat ischemic model.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Odor concentration change detectors in the Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>Dynamical changes in the environment strongly impact our perception [1,2]. Consistent with this, sensory systems preferentially represent stimulus changes, enhancing temporal contrast [3,4]. In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations ({Delta}Ct) can guide odor source localization. Yet the neural representation of {Delta}Ct has not been studied in vertebrates. We have found that a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells in the olfactory bulb explicitly represent {Delta}Ct. These concentration change detectors are direction selective: some respond to positive {Delta}Ct, while others represent negative {Delta}Ct. This change detection enhances the contrast between different concentrations and the magnitude of contrast enhancement scales with the size of the concentration step. Further, {Delta}Ct can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells explicitly represents {Delta}Ct, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Feedback between motion and sensation provides nonlinear boost in run-and-tumble navigation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005429</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Junjiajia Long, Steven W. Zucker, Thierry Emonet&lt;/p&gt;

Many organisms navigate gradients by alternating straight motions (runs) with random reorientations (tumbles), transiently suppressing tumbles whenever attractant signal increases. This induces a functional coupling between movement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the internal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal levels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state close to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the gradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient. Importantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the internal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on what happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we show here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter space where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are relatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of non-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point) inherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental nonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect. Most importantly, this amplification is asymmetric, elongating runs in favorable directions and abbreviating others. The result is a “ratchet-like” gradient climbing behavior with drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism. Our results thus show that the classical drawback of run-and-tumble navigation—wasteful runs in the wrong direction—can be mitigated by exploiting the non-normal dynamics implicit in the run-and-tumble strategy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y8sgPKcGQSU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deep-coverage metabolomic profiling has revealed a well-defined development of metabolic decay in human red blood cells (RBCs) under cold storage conditions. A set of extracellular biomarkers has been recently identified that reliably defines the qualitative state of the metabolic network throughout this metabolic decay process. Here, we extend the utility of these biomarkers by using them to quantitatively predict the concentrations of other metabolites in the red blood cell. We are able to accurately predict the concentration profile of 84 of the 91 (92%) measured metabolites (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in RBC metabolism using only measurements of these five biomarkers. The median of prediction errors (symmetric mean absolute percent error) across all metabolites was 13%. The ability to predict numerous metabolite concentrations from a simple set of biomarkers offers the potential for the development of a powerful workflow that could be used to evaluate the metabolic state of a biological system using a minimal set of measurements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wz-AfqFKrbI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring epidemiological parameters from phylogenies using regression-ABC: A comparative study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005416</guid>

Inferring epidemiological parameters such as the &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from time-scaled phylogenies is a timely challenge. Most current approaches rely on likelihood functions, which raise specific issues that range from computing these functions to finding their maxima numerically. Here, we present a new regression-based Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach, which we base on a large variety of summary statistics intended to capture the information contained in the phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot. The regression step involves the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, which is a robust machine learning technique. It allows us to readily deal with the large number of summary statistics, while avoiding resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To compare our approach to existing ones, we simulated target trees under a variety of epidemiological models and settings, and inferred parameters of interest using the same priors. We found that, for large phylogenies, the accuracy of our regression-ABC is comparable to that of likelihood-based approaches involving birth-death processes implemented in BEAST2. Our approach even outperformed these when inferring the host population size with a Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemiological model. It also clearly outperformed a recent kernel-ABC approach when assuming a Susceptible-Infected epidemiological model with two host types. Lastly, by re-analyzing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we showed that regression-ABC provides more realistic estimates for the duration parameters (latency and infectiousness) than the likelihood-based method. Overall, ABC based on a large variety of summary statistics and a regression method able to perform variable selection and avoid overfitting is a promising approach to analyze large phylogenies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1NOLnOyXUvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Managing uncertainty in metabolic network structure and improving predictions using EnsembleFBA</title>

Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still require curation before useful predictions can be made. We present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many alternative network structures, all equally consistent with available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble. This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting growth and gene essentiality in the model organism &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential genes in six &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; species and mapping the essential genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some metabolic subsystems contributed disproportionately to the set of predicted essential reactions in a way that was unique to each &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; species, leading to species-specific outcomes from small molecule interactions. Through our analyses of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and six &lt;i&gt;Streptococci&lt;/i&gt;, we show that ensembles increase the quality of predictions without drastically increasing reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical for applications which require predictions for many non-model organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are available in an open online repository.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W7ZjQjp635o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the primary objectives of human brain mapping is the division of the
cortical surface into functionally distinct regions, i.e. parcellation. While
it is generally agreed that at macro-scale different regions of the cortex have
different functions, the exact number and configuration of these regions is not
known. Methods for the discovery of these regions are thus important,
particularly as the volume of available information grows. Towards this end, we
present a parcellation method based on a Bayesian non-parametric mixture model
of cortical connectivity.

	<description>Two-photon imaging was used to examine taste responses in neurons in a region of gustatory cortex defined by thalamic input. This area contained an overlapping representation of primary tastes, with neurons that were either narrowly or broadly responsive to taste stimuli. Analysis demonstrates that activity in the neuronal population in this area yields information about both taste quality and hedonics.</description>

	<description>The more advanced our understanding of the brain of an animal is, the less likely that this animal is a conscious being. This provocative logical paradox is explained and analyzed, leading to the conclusion that to advance understanding of animal consciousness it is necessary to resolve first how our consciousness is produced by our brain.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanisms of fast and stringent search in homologous pairing of double-stranded DNA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005421</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Bitran, Wei-Yin Chiang, Erel Levine, Mara Prentiss&lt;/p&gt;

Self-organization in the cell relies on the rapid and specific binding of molecules to their cognate targets. Correct bindings must be stable enough to promote the desired function even in the crowded and fluctuating cellular environment. In systems with many nearly matched targets, rapid and stringent formation of stable products is challenging. Mechanisms that overcome this challenge have been previously proposed, including separating the process into multiple stages; however, how particular &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; systems overcome the challenge remains unclear. Here we consider a kinetic system, inspired by homology dependent pairing between double stranded DNA in bacteria. By considering a simplified tractable model, we identify different homology testing stages that naturally occur in the system. In particular, we first model dsDNA molecules as short rigid rods containing periodically spaced binding sites. The interaction begins when the centers of two rods collide at a random angle. For most collision angles, the interaction energy is weak because only a few binding sites near the collision point contribute significantly to the binding energy. We show that most incorrect pairings are rapidly rejected at this stage. In rare cases, the two rods enter a second stage by rotating into parallel alignment. While rotation increases the stability of matched and nearly matched pairings, subsequent rotational fluctuations reduce kinetic trapping. Finally, in vivo chromosome are much longer than the persistence length of dsDNA, so we extended the model to include multiple parallel collisions between long dsDNA molecules, and find that those additional interactions can greatly accelerate the searching.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OHNIgZ7jQgs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stroke in right dorsal anterior insular cortex is related to myocardial injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24906</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24906</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Elevated levels of cardiac troponin and especially their relative changes over time indicate acute myocardial injury. They are also frequently observed after acute ischemic stroke (AIS), indicating poor functional outcome and increased mortality. However, recent evidence showed that in most AIS patients myocardial injury is not caused by coronary ischemia. Instead, stroke lesion location has been suggested to precipitate myocardial injury. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was employed in 299 patients who had an MRI-confirmed acute ischemic stroke within the anterior circulation and a high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) acquired on the day of admission. Out of these, 228 had a second troponin measurement during the acute phase. The absolute hs-cTnT levels above the 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of a healthy reference population (≥14 ng/L) as well as their relative temporal changes were used as continuous variables of interest in the VLSM model, including a multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The anterior insular cortex of the right hemisphere, in particular its dorsal sub-region, was significantly associated with the relative temporal changes of hs-cTnT (p&amp;lt;0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, the baseline hs-cTnT levels on admission were not related to lesion location anywhere within the anterior circulation. &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results amplify recent evidence from functional neuroimaging, which suggests a prominent role of dorsal anterior insular cortex in the parasympathetic control of cardiac and autonomic function. Acute vascular damage of this insular sub-region might lead to autonomic dysbalance and an upregulation of sympathetic function, thereby resulting in myocardial injury.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The neurology of acutely failing respiratory mechanics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24908</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces involved in breathing—which effectively pull in air—are the diaphragmatic, intercostal, spine, and neck muscles. Equally important are the bulbar musculature maintaining the architecture of a patent airway conduit and abdominal wall and internal intercostal muscles providing cough. Acute injury along a neural trajectory from brainstem to muscle will impair the coordinated interaction between these muscle groups. Acutely failing respiratory mechanics can be caused by central and peripheral lesions. In central lesions, the key lesion is in the nucleus ambiguus innervating the dilator muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, but abnormal respiratory mechanics rarely coincide with abnormalities of the respiratory pattern generator. In peripheral lesions, diaphragmatic weakness is a main element, but in many neuromuscular disorders mechanical upper airway obstruction from oropharyngeal weakness contributes equally to an increased respiratory load. The neurology of breathing involves changes in respiratory drive, rhythm, mechanics and dynamics. This review focuses on the fundamentals of abnormal respiratory mechanics in acute neurologic conditions, bedside judgment, interpretation of additional laboratory tests, and initial stabilization with practical solutions provided. Many of these respiratory signs are relevant to neurologists, who, in acute situations, may see these patients first. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. While preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative day 3-4 and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Patients showed a global down-regulation of GM [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26±26% (mean±SD) at 3-4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p=&lt;/em&gt;0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the pro-inflammatory marker TNF-α in blood displayed a reduction (41±39%) on the 3-4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 &lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;. Change in Stroop color word cognitive test performance between postoperative day 3-4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to post-surgical impairments of cognitive function. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate in normal older adults and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) the impact of amyloid and regional tauopathy on cerebral glucose metabolism and subsequent memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We acquired positron emission tomography using F18 Flortaucipir (tau), C11 Pittsburgh Compound B (amyloid) and F18 Fluorodeoxyglucose in 90 clinically normal elderly of the Harvard Aging Brain Study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posterior cingulate metabolism decreased when both amyloid and neocortical tau were high and predicted subsequent memory decline in a larger sample of normal elderly. In contrast, frontal hypometabolism related to the common age-related entorhinal tauopathy, but this dysfunction was independent of amyloid, and did not predict significant memory decline. Neocortical tauopathy was positively associated with metabolism in individuals with sub-threshold amyloid, suggesting that glucose metabolism increases before decreasing in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study identified a synergistic effect of amyloid and tau deposits and demonstrated for the first time in normal elderly its link to AD-like hypometabolism and to AD-like memory decline. The amyloid effect was seen with tau in neocortex, but not with tau in entorhinal cortex, which is the common site of age-related tauopathy. Entorhinal tau was associated with frontal hypometabolism, but this dysfunction was not associated with memory loss. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Olig1 is required for Noggin-induced neonatal myelin repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24907</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt; – Neonatal white matter injury (NWMI) is a lesion found in preterm infants that can lead to cerebral palsy. Although antagonists of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, such as Noggin, promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production after hypoxic-ischemic injury, the downstream functional targets are poorly understood. The bHLH protein Olig1 promotes oligodendrocyte (OL) development and is essential during remyelination in adult mice. Here, we investigated whether &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function is required downstream of BMP antagonism for the response to injury in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; – We used wild type and &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; mutant mice subjected to neonatal stroke and postnatal neural progenitor cultures, and we analyzed Olig1 expression in human postmortem samples from neonates that suffered hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null neonatal mice showed significant hypomyelination after moderate neonatal stroke. Surprisingly, damaged white matter tracts in &lt;em&gt;Olig1-/-&lt;/em&gt; mice lacked Olig2+ OPCs and instead proliferating neuronal precursors and GABAergic interneurons were present. We demonstrate that Noggin-induced OPC production requires &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function. In postnatal neural progenitors, Noggin governs production of OLs versus interneurons through &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-mediated repression of &lt;em&gt;Dlx1/2&lt;/em&gt; transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that Olig1 and the BMP signaling effector pSMAD1/5/8 are elevated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of human infants with HIE compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; - These findings indicate that &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; has a critical function in the regulation of the postnatal neural progenitor cell production in response to Noggin.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 families with undiagnosed recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Whole exome or genome sequencing identified segregating homozygous variants in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;: c.51_64delAGGTGGGGGTCCCC in a Kuwaiti family and c.146G&amp;gt;C in an Israeli family. &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; is required for vesicle fusion at presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Electrodiagnostic examination showed severely low compound muscle action potentials and presynaptic impairment. We assessed the effect of the nonsense mutation on mRNA levels and evaluated the NMJ transmission in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;sup&gt;lew/lew&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, observing neurophysiological features of presynaptic impairment, similar to the patients. Taken together, our findings highlight &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; homozygous mutations as a cause of presynaptic CMS. This article is protected by copyright.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used to engineer precise genomic deletions with pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). This approach has been widely adopted for diverse applications, from disease modelling of individual loci, to parallelized loss-of-function screens of thousands of regulatory elements. However, no solution has been presented for the unique bioinformatic design requirements of CRISPR deletion. We here present CRISPETa, a pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model. Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target, and any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making CRISPETa equally useful for focussed or high-throughput studies. Fast run-times are achieved using a pre-computed off-target database. sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. We present pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of protein-coding and non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. In human cells, we reproducibly observe deletion efficiencies of ≥50% for CRISPETa designs targeting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the &lt;i&gt;MALAT1&lt;/i&gt; oncogene. In the latter case, deletion results in production of desired, truncated RNA. CRISPETa will be useful for researchers seeking to harness CRISPR for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xEb1Yig42QE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Novel non-invasive algorithm to identify the origins of re-entry and ectopic foci in the atria from 64-lead ECGs: A computational study</title>

Atrial tachy-arrhytmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), are characterised by irregular electrical activity in the atria, generally associated with erratic excitation underlain by re-entrant scroll waves, fibrillatory conduction of multiple wavelets or rapid focal activity. Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in AF prevalence in the developed world associated with an ageing society, highlighting the need for effective treatment options. Catheter ablation therapy, commonly used in the treatment of AF, requires spatial information on atrial electrical excitation. The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a method for non-invasive identification of the presence of arrhythmia, due to irregularity in the ECG signal associated with atrial activation compared to sinus rhythm, but has limitations in providing specific spatial information. There is therefore a pressing need to develop novel methods to identify and locate the origin of arrhythmic excitation. Invasive methods provide direct information on atrial activity, but may induce clinical complications. Non-invasive methods avoid such complications, but their development presents a greater challenge due to the non-direct nature of monitoring. Algorithms based on the ECG signals in multiple leads (e.g. a 64-lead vest) may provide a viable approach. In this study, we used a biophysically detailed model of the human atria and torso to investigate the correlation between the morphology of the ECG signals from a 64-lead vest and the location of the origin of rapid atrial excitation arising from rapid focal activity and/or re-entrant scroll waves. A focus-location algorithm was then constructed from this correlation. The algorithm had success rates of 93% and 76% for correctly identifying the origin of focal and re-entrant excitation with a spatial resolution of 40 mm, respectively. The general approach allows its application to any multi-lead ECG system. This represents a significant extension to our previously developed algorithms to predict the AF origins in association with focal activities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aQxhzqSSQ_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiregional integration in the brain during resting-state fMRI activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Etay Hay, Petra Ritter, Nancy J. Lobaugh, Anthony R. McIntosh&lt;/p&gt;

Data-driven models of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity can elucidate dependencies that involve the combination of multiple brain regions. Activity in some regions during resting-state fMRI can be predicted with high accuracy from the activities of other regions. However, it remains unclear in which regions activity depends on unique integration of multiple predictor regions. To address this question, sparse (parsimonious) models could serve to better determine key interregional dependencies by reducing false positives. We used resting-state fMRI data from 46 subjects, and for each region of interest (ROI) per subject we performed whole-brain recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select the minimal set of ROIs that best predicted activity in the modeled ROI. We quantified the dependence of activity on multiple predictor ROIs, by measuring the gain in prediction accuracy of models that incorporated multiple predictor ROIs compared to models that used a single predictor ROI. We identified regions that showed considerable evidence of multiregional integration and determined the key regions that contributed to their observed activity. Our models reveal fronto-parietal integration networks, little integration in primary sensory regions, as well as redundancy between some regions. Our study demonstrates the utility of whole-brain RFE to generate data-driven models with minimal sets of ROIs that predict activity with high accuracy. By determining the extent to which activity in each ROI depended on integration of signals from multiple ROIs, we find cortical integration networks during resting-state activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_quXv8wu9Yo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A magnesium-induced triplex pre-organizes the SAM-II riboswitch</title>

Our &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C- and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) experiments previously revealed a dynamic exchange between partially closed and open conformations of the SAM-II riboswitch in the absence of ligand. Here, all-atom structure-based molecular simulations, with the electrostatic effects of Manning counter-ion condensation and explicit magnesium ions are employed to calculate the folding free energy landscape of the SAM-II riboswitch. We use this analysis to predict that magnesium ions remodel the landscape, shifting the equilibrium away from the extended, partially unfolded state towards a compact, pre-organized conformation that resembles the ligand-bound state. Our CEST and SAXS experiments, at different magnesium ion concentrations, quantitatively confirm our simulation results, demonstrating that magnesium ions induce collapse and pre-organization. Agreement between theory and experiment bolsters microscopic interpretation of our simulations, which show that triplex formation between helix P2b and loop L1 is highly sensitive to magnesium and plays a key role in pre-organization. Pre-organization of the SAM-II riboswitch allows rapid detection of ligand with high selectivity, which is important for biological function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v3DxpjT_OoY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fidelity of the representation of value in decision-making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005405</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul M. Bays, Ben A. Dowding&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to make optimal decisions depends on evaluating the expected rewards associated with different potential actions. This process is critically dependent on the fidelity with which reward value information can be maintained in the nervous system. Here we directly probe the fidelity of value representation following a standard reinforcement learning task. The results demonstrate a previously-unrecognized bias in the representation of value: extreme reward values, both low and high, are stored significantly more accurately and precisely than intermediate rewards. The symmetry between low and high rewards pertained despite substantially higher frequency of exposure to high rewards, resulting from preferential exploitation of more rewarding options. The observed variation in fidelity of value representation retrospectively predicted performance on the reinforcement learning task, demonstrating that the bias in representation has an impact on decision-making. A second experiment in which one or other extreme-valued option was omitted from the learning sequence showed that representational fidelity is primarily determined by the relative position of an encoded value on the scale of rewards experienced during learning. Both variability and guessing decreased with the reduction in the number of options, consistent with allocation of a limited representational resource. These findings have implications for existing models of reward-based learning, which typically assume defectless representation of reward value.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tjMSB1_3nJ0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of the Hes1 crosstalk hub in Notch-Wnt interactions of the intestinal crypt</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005400</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/jAzv0LFRFR0/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sophie K. Kay, Heather A. Harrington, Sarah Shepherd, Keith Brennan, Trevor Dale, James M. Osborne, David J. Gavaghan, Helen M. Byrne&lt;/p&gt;

The Notch pathway plays a vital role in determining whether cells in the intestinal epithelium adopt a secretory or an absorptive phenotype. Cell fate specification is coordinated via Notch’s interaction with the canonical Wnt pathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt pathways, in which the Hes1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk. Computational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy intestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of biochemical knockouts upon cell fate selection processes. Chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the capacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing properties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific parameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the role of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations, demonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes1 promoter can induce dynamic transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to monostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the stabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-catenin- and Dsh-mediated action on the Hes1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular dynamics. Where Notch-mediated transcription of Hes1 dominates, there is Notch oscillation and maintenance of fate flexibility; Wnt-mediated transcription of Hes1 favours bistability akin to cell fate selection. Cells could therefore regulate the proportion of Wnt- and Notch-mediated control of the Hes1 promoter to coordinate the timing of cell fate selection as they migrate through the intestinal epithelium and are subject to reduced Wnt stimuli. Furthermore, mutant cells characterised by hyperstimulation of the Wnt pathway may, through coupling with Notch, invert cell fate in neighbouring healthy cells, enabling an aberrant cell to maintain its neighbours in mitotically active states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jAzv0LFRFR0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Quantitative muscle ultrasound detects disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24904</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24904</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: We assessed changes in quantitative muscle ultrasound data in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and healthy controls to determine if ultrasound can serve as a biomarker of disease progression. Two approaches were used: grey scale level (GSL), measured from the ultrasound image, and quantitative backscatter analysis (QBA) measured directly from the received echoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: GSL and QBA were obtained from six unilateral arm/leg muscles in 36 boys with DMD and 28 healthy boys (age 2-14 years) for up to 2 years. We used a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms to compare trajectories of GSL, QBA, and functional assessments. We analyzed separately a subset of boys who initiated corticosteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Compared to healthy boys, increasing GSL in DMD boys &amp;gt;7.0 years was first identified at 6 months (e.g., anterior forearm slope difference of 1.16 arbitrary units/month p=0.004, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.38,1.94]); in boys ≤7 years, differences in GSL first appeared at 12 months (0.82 arbitrary units/month, p=0.04 95%CI [0.075,1.565] in rectus femoris). QBA performed similarly to GSL (e.g., DMD boys &amp;gt;7 years of 0.41dB/month, p=0.01, 95%CI [0.096,0.72] in anterior forearm at 6 months). US identified differences earlier than functional measures including 6-minute walk and supine-to-stand tests. However, neither QBA nor GSL showed an effect of corticosteroid initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: QBA performs similarly to GSL and both appear more sensitive than functional assessments for detecting muscle deterioration in DMD. Additional studies will be required to determine if quantitative muscle ultrasound can detect therapeutic efficacy. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The genotype-phenotype map of an evolving digital organism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005414</guid>

To understand how evolving systems bring forth novel and useful phenotypes, it is essential to understand the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic change. Artificial evolving systems can help us understand whether the genotype-phenotype maps of natural evolving systems are highly unusual, and it may help create evolvable artificial systems. Here we characterize the genotype-phenotype map of digital organisms in Avida, a platform for digital evolution. We consider digital organisms from a vast space of 10&lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt; genotypes (instruction sequences), which can form 512 different phenotypes. These phenotypes are distinguished by different Boolean logic functions they can compute, as well as by the complexity of these functions. We observe several properties with parallels in natural systems, such as connected genotype networks and asymmetric phenotypic transitions. The likely common cause is robustness to genotypic change. We describe an intriguing tension between phenotypic complexity and evolvability that may have implications for biological evolution. On the one hand, genotypic change is more likely to yield novel phenotypes in more complex organisms. On the other hand, the total number of novel phenotypes reachable through genotypic change is highest for organisms with simple phenotypes. Artificial evolving systems can help us study aspects of biological evolvability that are not accessible in vastly more complex natural systems. They can also help identify properties, such as robustness, that are required for both human-designed artificial systems and synthetic biological systems to be evolvable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-XgVQA6KZNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling of the axon membrane skeleton structure and implications for its mechanical properties</title>

Super-resolution microscopy recently revealed that, unlike the soma and dendrites, the axon membrane skeleton is structured as a series of actin rings connected by spectrin filaments that are held under tension. Currently, the structure-function relationship of the axonal structure is unclear. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to show that the stiffness of the axon plasma membrane is significantly higher than the stiffnesses of dendrites and somas. To examine whether the structure of the axon plasma membrane determines its overall stiffness, we introduced a coarse-grain molecular dynamics model of the axon membrane skeleton that reproduces the structure identified by super-resolution microscopy. Our proposed computational model accurately simulates the median value of the Young’s modulus of the axon plasma membrane determined by atomic force microscopy. It also predicts that because the spectrin filaments are under entropic tension, the thermal random motion of the voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;), which are bound to ankyrin particles, a critical axonal protein, is reduced compared to the thermal motion when spectrin filaments held at equilibrium. Lastly, our model predicts that because spectrin filaments are under tension, any axonal injuries that lacerate spectrin filaments will likely lead to a permanent disruption of the membrane skeleton due to the inability of spectrin filaments to spontaneously form their initial under-tension configuration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-VD6TQL3g_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Imputation for transcription factor binding predictions based on deep learning</title>

Understanding the cell-specific binding patterns of transcription factors (TFs) is fundamental to studying gene regulatory networks in biological systems, for which ChIP-seq not only provides valuable data but is also considered as the gold standard. Despite tremendous efforts from the scientific community to conduct TF ChIP-seq experiments, the available data represent only a limited percentage of ChIP-seq experiments, considering all possible combinations of TFs and cell lines. In this study, we demonstrate a method for accurately predicting cell-specific TF binding for TF-cell line combinations based on only a small fraction (4%) of the combinations using available ChIP-seq data. The proposed model, termed TFImpute, is based on a deep neural network with a multi-task learning setting to borrow information across transcription factors and cell lines. Compared with existing methods, TFImpute achieves comparable accuracy on TF-cell line combinations with ChIP-seq data; moreover, TFImpute achieves better accuracy on TF-cell line combinations without ChIP-seq data. This approach can predict cell line specific enhancer activities in K562 and HepG2 cell lines, as measured by massively parallel reporter assays, and predicts the impact of SNPs on TF binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/In1dUI5aal0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful analytical tool for &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; molecular imaging of the human brain. Over the past years, a number of PET studies imaging the serotonin transporter (SERT) have been used and provided evidence for the key role of serotonergic pathology in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we review the role of SERT in the development of motor and nonmotor complications in patients with PD, and we performed a meta-analysis to identify the patterns of SERT pathology and the relevance to symptoms. Consistent SERT pathology in raphe nuclei, striatum, thalamus, and hypothalamus and associations with aging, PD progression, development of dyskinesias, and cognitive decline were observed.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24872-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archival serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were available from 96 of 118 consecutive PCA-2-IgG–seropositive patients identified during 1993–2016. The autoantigen, defined in mouse brain lysate by Western blot and mass spectrometry, was confirmed by dual immunohistochemical staining using commercial antibodies. The major antigenic region was defined by Western blot using recombinant protein fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24872-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IgG in 95 of 96 patients’ serum or CSF (but in none of 98 healthy or disease control subjects’ serum specimens) bound to recombinant MAP1B. A minority (17.5%) of patients’ IgG also bound to MAP1A. PCA-2 was often accompanied by additional neural autoantibody markers of small-cell carcinoma, including collapsin response-mediated protein 5 (CRMP5) IgG (26%) or antineuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA-1) IgG (also known as anti-Hu; 13%). Neurological manifestations in 95 patients were (in decreasing frequency): peripheral neuropathy, 53%; cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria, or dysarthria, 38%; and encephalopathy, 27%. Cancer (majority small-cell lung carcinoma [SCLC]) was detected in 66 of 84 evaluated patients (79%). The MAP1B (PCA-2) autoantibody detection rate, among approximately 70,000 patients undergoing service neural autoantibody evaluation in 2015, was 0.024%, equaling amphiphysin IgG (0.026%) and more common than ANNA-2 (also known as anti-Ri; 0.016%) and PCA-Tr (also known as delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor [DNER]; 0.006%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Its relatively high prevalence, compared with other recognized paraneoplastic neural autoantibodies, justifies its testing in comprehensive paraneoplastic neural autoantibody evaluation.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–induced locked-in state and their next of kin in a fully unbiased manner using eye-tracking computer systems. Eleven of 30 screened patients and 9 next of kin completed study procedures. Patients reported good QoL, which appeared to be at the cost of the QoL of their next of kin. Next of kin rated their own or patients’ QoL similarly, but they identified different areas as important as compared with patients. Our results are of importance for the discussion of end-of-life decisions and the evaluation of patients’ presumed wishes as well as for psychosocial interventions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tract-specific atrophy in focal epilepsy: Disease, genetics, or seizures?</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24848-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether genetics, underlying pathology, or repeated seizures contribute to atrophy in specific white matter tracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24848-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medically refractory unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS-TLE, n = 26) was studied as an archetype of focal epilepsy, using fixel-based analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging. A genetic effect was assessed in first-degree relatives of HS-TLE subjects who did not have epilepsy themselves (HS-1°Rel; n = 26). The role of disease process was uncovered by comparing HS-TLE to unilateral TLE with normal clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-neg TLE; n = 26, matched for seizure severity). The effect of focal seizures was inferred from lateralized atrophy common to both HS-TLE and MRI-neg TLE, in comparison to healthy controls (n = 76).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24848-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HS-1 °Rel had bilaterally small hippocampi, but no focal white matter atrophy was detected, indicating a limited effect of genetics. HS-TLE subjects had lateralized atrophy of most temporal lobe tracts, and hippocampal volumes in HS-TLE correlated with parahippocampal cingulum and anterior commissure atrophy, indicating an effect of the underlying pathology. Ipsilateral atrophy of the tapetum, uncinate, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus was found in both HS-TLE and MRI-neg TLE, suggesting a common lateralized effect of focal seizures. Both epilepsy groups had bilateral atrophy of the dorsal cingulum and corpus callosum fibers, which we interpret as a consequence of bilateral insults (potentially generalized seizures and/or medications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24848-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying pathology, repeated focal seizures, and global insults each contribute to atrophy in specific tracts.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Depolarizing γ-aminobutyric acid contributes to glutamatergic network rewiring in epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24870-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewiring of excitatory glutamatergic neuronal circuits is a major abnormality in epilepsy. Besides the rewiring of excitatory circuits, an abnormal depolarizing γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) drive has been hypothesized to participate in the epileptogenic processes. However, a remaining clinically relevant question is whether early post–status epilepticus (SE) evoked chloride dysregulation is important for the remodeling of aberrant glutamatergic neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24870-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osmotic minipumps were used to infuse intracerebrally a specific inhibitor of depolarizing GABAergic transmission as well as a functionally blocking antibody toward the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;). The compounds were infused between 2 and 5 days after pilocarpine-induced SE. Immunohistochemistry for NKCC1, KCC2, and ectopic recurrent mossy fiber (rMF) sprouting as well as telemetric electroencephalographic and electrophysiological recordings were performed at day 5 and 2 months post-SE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24870-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockade of NKCC1 after SE with the specific inhibitor bumetanide restored NKCC1 and KCC2 expression, normalized chloride homeostasis, and significantly reduced the glutamatergic rMF sprouting within the dentate gyrus. This mechanism partially involves p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, as bumetanide application reduced SE-induced p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; expression and functional blockade of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; decreased rMF sprouting. The early transient (3 days) post-SE infusion of bumetanide reduced rMF sprouting and recurrent seizures in the chronic epileptic phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24870-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that early post-SE abnormal depolarizing GABA and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; signaling fosters a long-lasting rearrangement of glutamatergic network that contributes to the epileptogenic process. This finding defines promising and novel targets to constrain reactive glutamatergic network rewiring in adult epilepsy. Ann Neurol 2017;81:251–265&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is associated with unique HLA subtypes</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24860-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune encephalitis (AE), represented by anti–leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) and anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, has increasing clinical significance based on recent discoveries of neuronal autoantibodies. However, its immunopathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether AE is associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24860-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared the HLA genotypes of 11 anti-LGI1 and 17 anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients to the control groups, which consisted of 210 epilepsy patients and 485 healthy Koreans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24860-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-LGI1 encephalitis was associated with the DRB1*07:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype (10 patients; 91%) in HLA class II genes, as well as with B*44:03 (8 patients; 73%) and C*07:06 (7 patients; 64%) in the HLA class I region. The prevalence of these alleles in anti-LGI1 encephalitis was significantly higher than that in the epilepsy controls or healthy controls. By contrast, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was not associated with HLA genotypes. Additional analysis using HLA-peptide binding prediction algorithms and computational docking underpinned the close relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24860-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that most anti-LGI1 encephalitis develops in a population with specific HLA subtypes, providing insight into a novel disease mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;Many people still associate brain glucose metabolism with neurons. A new report shows that stimulation of astrocytic glutamate uptake increases glucose utilization, suggesting that astrocytes play a major role in the glucose uptake signal. However, this still reflects synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn from others' experience, one must link environmental conditions with social cues. A specific amygdala circuit underlies social learning of fear, and targeted activation normalizes behavior in a rodent model of autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Jeffrey W. Dalley &amp;amp; Trevor W. Robbins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to make decisions and act quickly without hesitation can be advantageous in many settings. However, when persistently expressed, impulsive decisions and actions are considered risky, maladaptive and symptomatic of such diverse brain disorders as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug addiction and affective disorders. Over &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience 18, 172 (2017).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Laurence T. Hunt &amp;amp; Benjamin Y. Hayden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many accounts of reward-based choice argue for distinct component processes that are serial and functionally localized. In this Opinion article, we argue for an alternative viewpoint, in which choices emerge from repeated computations that are distributed across many brain regions. We emphasize how several features &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience 18, 183 (2017).  
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Carlo Sestieri, Gordon L. Shulman &amp;amp; Maurizio Corbetta&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is traditionally associated with attention, perceptual decision making and sensorimotor transformations, but more recent human neuroimaging studies support an additional role in episodic memory retrieval. In this Opinion article, we present a functional–anatomical model of the involvement of the PPC &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Generalizable knowledge outweighs incidental details in prefrontal ensemble code over time</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memories for recent experiences are rich in incidental detail, but with time the brain is thought to extract latent rules and structures common across past experiences. We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Speed and segmentation control mechanisms characterized in rhythmically-active circuits created from spinal neurons produced from genetically-tagged embryonic stem cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flexible neural networks, such as the interconnected spinal neurons that control distinct motor actions, can switch their activity to produce different behaviors. Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A conformational switch regulates the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21036</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21036</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 has key roles in tumorigenesis, yet it is unkown how its activity is regulated. We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues—a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Transient inhibition and long-term facilitation of locomotion by phasic optogenetic activation of serotonin neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20975</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Distinct modes of SMAD2 chromatin binding and remodeling shape the transcriptional response to NODAL/Activin signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22474</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22474</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2. How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20183</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20183</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Spontaneous activation of visual pigments in relation to openness/closedness of chromophore-binding pocket</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18492</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18492</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual pigments can be spontaneously activated by internal thermal energy, generating noise that interferes with real-light detection. Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), with pigments having longer λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, possibly ascribed to an ‘open’ chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the ‘non-open’ nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cytokine IL-17 is expressed in the brain, but its function is not known. Chen et al. found that the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of IL-17 regulates the aggregation of worms following a rise in environmental oxygen and that it mediates this effect by &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic use of opioid analgesics can cause analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), contributing to dose escalation in patients. Corder et al. here provide evidence that, in mice, these unwanted effects, and the underlying altered circuit plasticity, are mediated by μ opioid receptors (MORs) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms that regulate synaptic vesicle recycling are unclear. Here, Li et al. show that Ca2+ sensors that drive vesicle fusion also influence vesicle endocytosis. High-resolution recordings of fluorescently tagged vesicles revealed a role of synaptotagmin 1 in the regulation of the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity promotes glycolysis at terminals to sustain synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Ashrafi et al. expressed a pHluorin-tagged variant of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in rat hippocampal neurons and showed that, with sustained firing of action potentials, &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Neurons affected in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) experience mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic deficit that occurs early and promotes the disease-defining amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and Tau pathologies. Emerging findings suggest that the autophagy/lysosome pathway that removes damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) is also compromised in AD, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Results in animal and cellular models of AD and in patients with sporadic late-onset AD suggest that impaired mitophagy contributes to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits by triggering Aβ and Tau accumulation through increases in oxidative damage and cellular energy deficits; these, in turn, impair mitophagy.</description>

	<title>: Cap-proximal nucleotides via differential eIF4E binding and alternative promoter usage mediate translational response to energy stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21907</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21907</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcription start-site (TSS) selection and alternative promoter (AP) usage contribute to gene expression complexity but little is known about their impact on translation. Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: ERG-28 controls BK channel trafficking in the ER to regulate synaptic function and alcohol response in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24733</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e24733</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage- and calcium-dependent BK channels regulate calcium-dependent cellular events such as neurotransmitter release by limiting calcium influx. Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of &lt;em&gt;erg-28&lt;/em&gt; suppressed phenotypic defects of &lt;em&gt;slo-1&lt;/em&gt; gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling &lt;em&gt;slo-1&lt;/em&gt; loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Genetic control of encoding strategy in a food-sensing neural circuit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24040</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroendocrine circuits encode environmental information via changes in gene expression and other biochemical activities to regulate physiological responses. Previously, we showed that &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; TGF&lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mathjax mml-math&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;β&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; tryptophan hydroxylase expression in specific neurons encode food abundance to modulate lifespan in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, and uncovered cross- and self-regulation among these genes (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib11&quot;&gt;Entchev et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;). Here, we now extend these findings by showing that these interactions between &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; regulate redundancy and synergy among neurons in food encoding through coordinated control of circuit-level signal and noise properties. Our analysis further shows that &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; contribute to most of the food-responsiveness in the modulation of lifespan. We applied a computational model to capture the general coding features of this system. This model agrees with our previous genetic analysis and highlights the consequences of redundancy and synergy during information transmission, suggesting a rationale for the regulation of these information processing features.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: The golden mimicry complex uses a wide spectrum of defence to deter a community of predators</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22089</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22089</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mimicry complexes typically consist of multiple species that deter predators using similar anti-predatory signals. Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, tree hoppers and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant &lt;em&gt;Gestalt&lt;/em&gt;, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Functional double dissociation within the entorhinal cortex for visual scene-dependent choice behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21543</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21543</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How visual scene memory is processed differentially by the upstream structures of the hippocampus is largely unknown. We sought to dissociate functionally the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC, respectively) in visual scene-dependent tasks by temporarily inactivating the LEC and MEC in the same rat. When the rat made spatial choices in a T-maze using visual scenes displayed on LCD screens, the inactivation of the MEC but not the LEC produced severe deficits in performance. However, when the task required the animal to push a jar or to dig in the sand in the jar using the same scene stimuli, the LEC but not the MEC became important. Our findings suggest that the entorhinal cortex is critical for scene-dependent mnemonic behavior, and the response modality may interact with a sensory modality to determine the involvement of the LEC and MEC in scene-based memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Generation of shape complexity through tissue conflict resolution</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20156</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Out-of-plane tissue deformations are key morphogenetic events during plant and animal development that generate 3D shapes, such as flowers or limbs. However, the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression modify cellular behaviours to generate such deformations remain to be established. We use the Snapdragon flower as a model system to address this problem. Combining cellular analysis with tissue-level modelling, we show that an orthogonal pattern of growth orientations plays a key role in generating out-of-plane deformations. This growth pattern is most likely oriented by a polarity field, highlighted by PIN1 protein localisation, and is modulated by dorsoventral gene activity. The orthogonal growth pattern interacts with other patterns of differential growth to create tissue conflicts that shape the flower. Similar shape changes can be generated by contraction as well as growth, suggesting tissue conflict resolution provides a flexible morphogenetic mechanism for generating shape diversity in plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A long-term epigenetic memory switch controls bacterial virulence bimodality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19599</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19599</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When pathogens enter the host, sensing of environmental cues activates the expression of virulence genes. Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are ion channels activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and are essential to all aspects of brain function, including learning and memory formation. Missense mutations distributed throughout NMDAR subunits have been associated with an array of neurological disorders. Recent structural, functional, and computational studies have generated many insights into the activation process connecting glutamate binding to ion-channel opening, which is central to NMDAR physiology and pathophysiology.</description>
