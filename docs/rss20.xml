	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Buildup and bistability in auditory streaming as an evidence accumulation process with saturation</title>

	<description>A repeating triplet-sequence ABA_ of non-overlapping brief tones, A and B, is a valued paradigm for studying auditory stream formation and the cocktail party problem. The stimulus is &quot;heard&quot; either as a galloping pattern (integration) or as two interleaved streams (segregation); the initial percept is typically integration then followed by spontaneous alternations between segregation and integration, each being dominant for a few seconds. The probability of segregation grows over seconds, from near-zero to a steady value, defining the buildup function, BUF. Its stationary level increases with the difference in tone frequencies, DF, and the BUF rises faster. Percept durations have DF-dependent means and are gamma-like distributed. Behavioral and computational studies usually characterize triplet streaming either during alternations or during buildup. Here, our experimental design and modeling encompass both. We propose a pseudo-neuromechanistic model that incorporates spiking activity in primary auditory cortex, A1, as input and resolves perception along two network-layers downstream of A1. Our model is straightforward and intuitive. It describes the noisy accumulation of evidence against the current percept which generates switches when reaching a threshold. Accumulation can saturate either above or below threshold; if below, the switching dynamics resemble noise-induced transitions from an attractor state. Our model accounts quantitatively for three key features of data: the BUFs, mean durations, and normalized dominance duration distributions, at various DF values. It describes perceptual alternations without competition per se, and underscores that treating triplets in the sequence independently and averaging across trials, as implemented in earlier widely cited studies, is inadequate.</description>

High-throughput sequencing has become ubiquitous in biomedical sciences. As new technologies emerge and sequencing costs decline, the diversity and volume of available data increases exponentially, and successfully navigating the data becomes more challenging. Though datasets are often hosted by public repositories, scientists must rely on inconsistent annotation to identify and interpret meaningful data. Moreover, the experimental heterogeneity and wide-ranging quality of high-throughput biological data means that even data with desired cell lines, tissue types, or molecular targets may not be readily interpretable or integrated. We have developed ORSO (Online Resource for Social Omics) as an easy-to-use web application to connect life scientists with genomics data. In ORSO, users interact within a data-driven social network, where they can favorite datasets and follow other users. In addition to more than 30,000 datasets hosted from major biomedical consortia, users may contribute their own data to ORSO, facilitating its discovery by other users. Leveraging user interactions, ORSO provides a novel recommendation system to automatically connect users with hosted data. In addition to social interactions, the recommendation system considers primary read coverage information and annotated metadata. Similarities used by the recommendation system are presented by ORSO in a graph display, allowing exploration of dataset associations. The topology of the network graph reflects established biology, with samples from related systems grouped together. We tested the recommendation system using an RNA-seq time course dataset from differentiation of embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes. The ORSO recommendation system correctly predicted early data point sources as embryonic stem cells and late data point sources as heart and muscle samples, resulting in recommendation of related datasets. By connecting scientists with relevant data, ORSO provides a critical new service that facilitates wide-ranging research interests.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i1I_hz584xs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Quantification of behaviour is essential for biology. Since the whisker system is a popular model system, it is important to have methods for measuring whisker movements from behaving animals. Here, we developed a high-speed imaging system that measures whisker movements simultaneously from two vantage points. We developed a whisker tracker algorithm that automatically reconstructs 3D whisker information directly from the ‘stereo’ video data. The tracker is controlled via a Graphical User Interface that also allows user-friendly curation. The algorithm tracks whiskers, by fitting a 3D Bezier curve to the basal section of each target whisker. By using prior knowledge of natural whisker motion and natural whisker shape to constrain the fits and by minimising the number of fitted parameters, the algorithm is able to track multiple whiskers in parallel with low error rate. We used the output of the tracker to produce a 3D description of each tracked whisker, including its 3D orientation and 3D shape, as well as bending-related mechanical force. In conclusion, we present a non-invasive, automatic system to track whiskers in 3D from high-speed video, creating the opportunity for comprehensive 3D analysis of sensorimotor behaviour and its neural basis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0cGdliKtXMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Mendelian randomization study of obesity and cerebrovascular disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25686?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To systematically investigate causal relationships between obesity and cerebrovascular disease, and the extent to which hypertension and hyperglycemia mediate the effect of obesity on cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics from genome‐wide association studies for body mass index (BMI), waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) and multiple cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. We explored causal associations with two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) accounting for genetic covariation between BMI and WHR; and assessed what proportion of the association between obesity and cerebrovascular disease was mediated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood glucose levels respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic predisposition to higher BMI did not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, for each 10% increase in WHR there was a 75% increase (95% confidence interval (CI)=44%‐113%) in risk for large artery ischemic stroke, a 57% (CI=29%‐91%) increase in risk for small vessel ischemic stroke, a 197% increase (CI=59%‐457%) in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as an increase in white matter hyperintensity volume (β=0.11; CI=0.01‐0.21). These WHR associations persisted after adjusting for genetic determinants of BMI. Approximately one tenth of the observed effect of WHR was mediated by SBP for ischemic stroke (12%; CI=4%‐20%), but no evidence of mediation was found for average blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal adiposity may trigger causal pathological processes, partially independent from blood pressure and totally independent from glucose levels, that lead to cerebrovascular disease. Potential targets of these pathological processes could represent novel therapeutic opportunities for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Estrogen and progesterone (P4) act in neural circuits to elicit lordosis, the stereotypical female sexual receptivity behavior. Estradiol acts through membrane receptors to rapidly activate a limbic-hypothalamic circuit consisting of the arcuate (ARH), medial preoptic (MPN), and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei of the hypothalamus. This initial activation results in a transient but necessary inhibition of lordosis, which appears to be a result of the release of β-endorphin (β-End) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) terminals onto cells containing the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the MPN. To functionally examine the role of the MOR in the hypothalamic lordosis circuit, we transfected a channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus into POMC cell bodies in the ARH and photostimulated POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive female Pomc-cre mice. Following estrogen and P4 priming, sexual receptivity was assessed by measuring the lordosis quotient (LQ). Following an initial trial for sexual receptivity, mice were photostimulated during behavioral testing, and brains were processed for MOR immunohistochemistry (IHC). Photostimulation decreased the LQ only in ChR2-expressing Pomc-cre mice. Furthermore, photostimulation of ChR2 in POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN resulted in the internalization of MOR, indicating activation of the receptor. Our results suggest that the activation of the MOR in the MPN is sufficient to attenuate lordosis behavior in a hormone-primed, sexually receptive female mouse. These data support a central role of MOR in female sexual behavior, and provide further insight into the hypothalamus control of sexual receptivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) are being more widely used by researchers as an instrument platform for monitoring prolonged, non-destructive recordings of spontaneously firing neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; for applications in modeling Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, and many other diseases of the human CNS. With the more widespread use of these instruments, there is a need to examine the prior art of studies utilizing MEAs and delineate best practices for data acquisition and analysis to avoid errors in interpretation of the resultant data. Using a dataset of recordings from primary rat (&lt;i&gt;Rattus norvegicus&lt;/i&gt;) cortical cultures, methods and statistical power for discerning changes in neuronal activity on the array level are examined. Further, a method for unsupervised spike sorting is implemented, allowing for the resolution of action potential incidents down to the single neuron level. Following implementation of spike sorting, the dynamics of firing frequency across populations of individual neurons and networks are examined longitudinally. Finally, the ability to detect a frequency independent phenotype, the change in action potential amplitude, is demonstrated through the use of pore-forming neurotoxin treatments. Taken together, this study provides guidance and tools for users wishing to incorporate multi-well MEA usage into their studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: CRPS is not associated with altered sensorimotor cortex GABA or glutamate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0389-19.2020v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating chronic pain disorder typically in the upper or lower limbs. Whilst CRPS usually develops from a peripheral event, it is likely maintained by central nervous system changes. Indeed CRPS is reported to be associated with sensorimotor cortex changes, or functional ‘reorganisation’, as well as deficits such as poor tactile acuity. Whilst the mechanisms underpinning cortical reorganisation in CRPS are unknown, some have hypothesised that it involves disinhibition, i.e. a reduction in gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. In this study we addressed this hypothesis by using edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine sensorimotor GABA and glutamate concentrations in 16 humans with CRPS and 30 matched controls and the relationship of these concentrations with tactile acuity. We found that individuals with upper limb CRPS displayed reduced tactile acuity in the painful hand compared with the non-painful hand and pain-free controls. Despite this acuity deficit, CRPS was not associated with altered GABA or glutamate concentrations within the sensorimotor cortex on either the side that represents the affected or unaffected hand. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations and tactile acuity in CRPS or control subjects. Although our sample was small, these data suggest that CRPS is not associated with altered total sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations. Whilst these results are at odds with the sensorimotor cortex disinhibition hypothesis, it is possible that GABAergic mechanisms other than total GABA concentration may contribute to such disinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Complex regional pain syndrome is a debilitating chronic pain disorder that usually affects the limbs. It is associated with altered sensorimotor cortex function including reorganisation and reduced tactile acuity, which are thought to result from reduced on-going inhibition. However, we found that this pain condition is not associated with reduced on-going sensorimotor inhibition in the form of gamma-Aminobutyric acid concentration, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. These findings strongly suggest that changes in sensorimotor function in individuals with complex regional pain syndrome are explained by factors other than neurotransmitter concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Fine‐mapping of SNCA in REM sleep behavior disorder and overt synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25687?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25687?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prodromal synucleinopathy, as &amp;gt;80% will eventually convert to overt synucleinopathy. We performed an in‐depth analysis of the &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; locus to identify RBD‐specific risk variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full sequencing and genotyping of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; was performed in isolated/idiopathic RBD (iRBD, n=1,076), Parkinson's disease (PD, n=1,013), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=415), and in control subjects (n=6,155). iRBD cases were diagnosed with RBD prior to neurodegeneration, although some have since converted. A replication cohort from 23andMe of PD patients with probable RBD (pRBD) was also analyzed (cases n=1,782, controls n=131,250). Adjusted logistic regression models and meta‐analyses were performed. Effects on conversion rate were analyzed in 432 RBD patients with available data using Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 5'‐region &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; variant (rs10005233) was associated with iRBD (OR=1.43, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=1.1E‐08), which was replicated in pRBD. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other 5' risk variants across the different synucleinopathies. An independent iRBD‐specific suggestive association (rs11732740) was detected at the 3' of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; (OR=1.32, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=4.7E‐04, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). Homozygous carriers of both iRBD‐specific SNPs were at highly increased risk for iRBD (OR=5.74, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=2E‐06). The known top PD‐associated variant (3' variant rs356182) had an opposite direction of effect in iRBD compared to PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct pattern of association at the &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; locus in RBD as compared to PD, with an opposite direction of effect at the 3' of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt;. Several 5' &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; variants are associated with iRBD and with pRBD in overt synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have proposed that one can summarize brain activity into
dynamics among a relatively small number of hidden states and that such an
approach is a promising tool for revealing brain function. Hidden Markov models
(HMMs) are a prevalent approach to inferring dynamics among discrete states in
neural data. However, the validity of modeling neural time series data with
HMMs has not been established. Here, to address this situation and examine the
performance of the HMM, we compare it with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM),
which is a statistically simpler model than the HMM with no assumption of
Markovianity. We do so by applying both models to synthetic and empirical
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We find that
the GMM allows us to interpret the sequence of the estimated hidden states as a
time series obeying some patterns. We show that GMMs are often better than HMMs
in terms of the accuracy and consistency of estimating the time course of the
hidden state. These results suggest that GMMs can be a model of first choice
for investigating hidden-state dynamics in data even if the time series is
apparently not memoryless.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in brain recording technology and artificial intelligence are
propelling a new paradigm in neuroscience beyond the traditional controlled
experiment. Naturalistic neuroscience studies neural computations associated
with spontaneous behaviors performed in unconstrained settings. Analyzing such
unstructured data lacking a priori experimental design remains a significant
challenge, especially when the data is multi-modal and long-term. Here we
describe an automated approach for analyzing large ($\approx$250 GB/subject)
datasets of simultaneously recorded human electrocorticography (ECoG) and
naturalistic behavior video data for 12 subjects. Our pipeline discovers and
annotates thousands of instances of human upper-limb movement events in
long-term (7--9 day) naturalistic behavior data using a combination of computer
vision, discrete latent-variable modeling, and string pattern-matching.
Analysis of the simultaneously recorded brain data uncovers neural signatures
of movement that corroborate prior findings from traditional controlled
experiments. We also prototype a decoder for a movement initiation detection
task to demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline as a source of training data
for brain-computer interfacing applications. We plan to publish our curated
dataset, which captures naturalistic neural and behavioral variability at a
scale not previously available. We believe this data will enable further
research on models of neural function and decoding that incorporate such
naturalistic variability and perform more robustly in real-world settings.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Unsupervised learning of control signals and their encodings in $\textit{C. elegans}$ whole-brain recordings. (arXiv:2001.08346v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent whole brain imaging experiments on $\textit{C. elegans}$ has revealed
that the neural population dynamics encode motor commands and stereotyped
transitions between behaviors on low dimensional manifolds. Efforts to
characterize the dynamics on this manifold have used piecewise linear models to
describe the entire state space, but it is unknown how a single, global
dynamical model can generate the observed dynamics. Here, we propose a control
framework to achieve such a global model of the dynamics, whereby underlying
linear dynamics is actuated by sparse control signals. This method learns the
control signals in an unsupervised way from data, then uses $\textit{ Dynamic
Mode Decomposition with control}$ (DMDc) to create the first global, linear
dynamical system that can reconstruct whole-brain imaging data. These control
signals are shown to be implicated in transitions between behaviors. In
addition, we analyze the time-delay encoding of these control signals, showing
that these transitions can be predicted from neurons previously implicated in
behavioral transitions, but also additional neurons previously unidentified.
Moreover, our decomposition method allows one to understand the observed
nonlinear global dynamics instead as linear dynamics with control. The proposed
mathematical framework is generic and can be generalized to other neurosensory
systems, potentially revealing transitions and their encodings in a completely
unsupervised way.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08332</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent whole-brain calcium imaging recordings of the nematode C. elegans have
demonstrated that neural activity is dominated by dynamics on a low-dimensional
manifold that can be clustered according to behavioral states. Despite progress
in modeling the dynamics with linear or locally linear models, it remains
unclear how a single network of neurons can produce the observed features. In
particular, there are multiple clusters, or fixed points, observed in the data
which cannot be characterized by a single linear model. We propose a nonlinear
control model which is global and parameterized by only four free parameters
that match the features displayed by the low-dimensional C. elegans neural
activity. In addition to reproducing the average probability distribution of
the data, long and short time-scale changes in transition statistics can be
characterized via changes in a single parameter. Some of these macro-scale
transitions have experimental correlates to single neuro-modulators that seem
to act as biological controls, allowing this model to generate testable
hypotheses about the effect of these neuro-modulators on the global dynamics.
The theory provides an elegant characterization of the neuron population
dynamics in C. elegans. Moreover, the mathematical structure of the nonlinear
control framework provides a paradigm that can be generalized to more complex
systems with an arbitrary number of behavioral states.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to record from increasingly large numbers of neurons, and the
increasing attention being paid to large scale neural network simulations,
demands computationally fast algorithms to compute relevant statistical
measures. We present an O(n) algorithm for calculating the Kendall correlation
of spike trains, a correlation measure that is becoming especially recognized
as an important tool in neuroscience. We show that our method is around 50
times faster than the O (n ln n) method which is a current standard for quickly
computing the Kendall correlation. In addition to providing a faster algorithm,
we emphasize the role that taking the specific nature of spike trains had on
reducing the run time. We imagine that there are many other useful algorithms
that can be even more significantly sped up when taking this into
consideration. A MATLAB function executing the method described here has been
made freely available on-line.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Plasticity in Limbic Regions at Early Time Points in Experimental Models of Tinnitus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00088</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00088</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent auditory disorders worldwide, manifesting in both chronic and acute forms. The pathology of tinnitus has been mechanistically linked to induction of harmful neural plasticity stemming from traumatic noise exposure, exposure to ototoxic medications, input deprivation from age-related hearing loss, and in response to injuries or disorders damaging the conductive apparatus of the ears, the cochlear hair cells, the ganglionic cells of the VIIIth cranial nerve, or neurons of the classical auditory pathway which link the cochlear nuclei through the inferior colliculi and medial geniculate nuclei to auditory cortices. Research attempting to more specifically characterize the neural plasticity occurring in tinnitus have used a wide range of techniques, experimental paradigms, and sampled at different windows of time to reach different conclusions about why and which specific brain regions are crucial in the induction or ongoing maintenance of tinnitus-related plasticity. Despite differences in experimental methodologies, evidence reveals similar findings that strongly suggest that immediate and prolonged activation of non-classical auditory structures (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex) may contribute to the initiation and development of tinnitus in addition to the ongoing maintenance of this devastating condition. The overarching focus of this review, therefore, is to highlight findings from the field supporting the hypothesis that abnormal early activation of non-classical sensory limbic regions are involved in tinnitus induction, with activation of these regions continuing to occur at different temporal stages. Since initial/early stages of tinnitus are difficult to control and to quantify in human clinical populations, a number of different animal paradigms have been developed and assessed in experimental investigations. Reviews of traumatic noise exposure and ototoxic doses of sodium salicylate, the most prevalently used animal models to induce experimental tinnitus, indicate early limbic system plasticity (within hours, minutes, or days after initial insult), supports subsequent plasticity in other auditory regions, and contributes to the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Understanding this early plasticity presents additional opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate tinnitus from the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Regulator of G-Protein Signaling (RGS) Protein Modulation of Opioid Receptor Signaling as a Potential Target for Pain Management</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00005</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Opioid drugs are the gold standard for the management of pain, but their use is severely limited by dangerous and unpleasant side effects. All clinically available opioid analgesics bind to and activate the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor, to produce analgesia. The activity of these receptors is modulated by a family of intracellular RGS proteins or regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, characterized by the presence of a conserved RGS Homology (RH) domain. These proteins act as negative regulators of G-protein signaling by serving as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPS to switch off signaling by both the Gα and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Consequently, knockdown or knockout of RGS protein activity enhances signaling downstream of MOR. In this review we discuss current knowledge of how this activity, across the different families of RGS proteins, modulates MOR activity, as well as activity of other members of the opioid receptor family, and so pain and analgesia in animal models, with particular emphasis on RGS4 and RGS9 families. We discuss inhibition of RGS proteins with small molecule inhibitors that bind to sensitive cysteine moieties in the RH domain and the potential for targeting this family of intracellular proteins as adjuncts to provide an opioid sparing effect or as standalone analgesics by promoting the activity of endogenous opioid peptides. Overall, we conclude that RGS proteins may be a novel drug target to provide analgesia with reduced opioid-like side effects, but that much basic work is needed to define the roles for specific RGS proteins, particularly in chronic pain, as well as a need to develop newer inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Herpes Simplex Virus 1-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Damage Involves Apoptosis Associated With GM130-Mediated Golgi Stress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection can lead to a high mortality rate and severe neurological sequelae. The destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important pathological mechanism for the development of HSE. However, the specific mechanism underlying the BBB destruction remains unclear. Our previous study found that the Golgi apparatus (GA) plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Therefore, this present study aimed to investigate the role of the GA in the destruction of the BBB and its underlying mechanisms. Mouse brain endothelial cells (Bend.3) were cultured to establish a BBB model in vitro, and then infected with HSV-1. The results showed that HSV-1 infection caused downregulation of the Golgi-associated protein GM130, accompanied by Golgi fragmentation, cell apoptosis, and downregulation of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 5. Knockdown of GM130 with small interfering RNA in uninfected Bend.3 cells triggered Golgi fragmentation, apoptosis, and downregulation of occludin and claudin 5. However, overexpression of GM130 in HSV-1 infected Bend.3 cells by transient transfection partially attenuated the aforementioned damage caused by HSV-1 infection. When the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was used after HSV-1 infection to inhibit apoptosis, the protein levels of GM130, occludin and claudin 5 were partially restored. Taken together, these observations indicate that HSV-1 infection of Bend.3 cells triggers a GM130-mediated Golgi stress response that is involved in apoptosis, which in turn results in downregulation of occludin and claudin 5 protein levels. Meanwhile, GM130 downregulation is partially due to apoptosis triggered by HSV-1 infection. Our findings reveal an association between the GA and the BBB during HSV-1 infection and identify potentially novel targets for protecting the BBB and therapeutic approaches for patients with HSE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Low and High Molecular Weight FGF-2 Have Differential Effects on Astrocyte Proliferation, but Are Both Protective Against Aβ-Induced Cytotoxicity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells in the brain, and they play a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) has been implicated as a potential therapeutic agent for treating AD. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of low molecular weight (LMW; 17 KDa) and high molecular weight (HMW; 23 KDa) forms of FGF-2 on Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced toxicity, and proliferation in astrocytes. We show that both isoforms of FGF-2 have similar protective effects against Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured cortical astrocytes as measured by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Additionally, 17 KDa FGF-2 significantly promoted astrocyte proliferation as measured by Trypan Blue, DRAQ5 and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, but not 23 kDa FGF-2. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that AKT signaling pathway was required for the protective and proliferative effects of FGF-2. Downstream effector studies indicated that 17 kDa FGF-2 promoted astrocyte proliferation by enhanced expression of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E. Furthermore, our data suggested that Cyclin D1 was required for the proliferative effect of LMW FGF2 in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings provide important information for the similarities and differences between 23 kDa and17 kDa isoforms of FGF-2 on astrocyte survival and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neurogranin Regulates Metaplasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00322</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00322</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two major forms of synaptic plasticity that are widely accepted as cellular mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Metaplasticity is a process whereby modifications in synaptic processes shift the threshold for subsequent plasticity. While metaplasticity has been functionally observed, its molecular basis is not well understood. Here, we report that neurogranin (Ng) regulates metaplasticity by shifting the threshold toward potentiation, i.e., increasing Ng in hippocampal neurons lowers the threshold for LTP and augments the threshold for LTD. We also show that Ng does not change the ultrastructural localization of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) or calcineurin, critical enzymes for the induction of LTP and LTD, respectively. Interestingly, while CaMKII concentrates close to the plasma membrane, calcineurin concentrates away from the plasma membrane. These data, along with the previous observation showing Ng targets CaM closer to the plasma membrane, suggesting that shifting the localization of CaM within the dendritic spines and closer to the plasma membrane, where there is more CaMKII, may be favoring the activation of CaMKII vs. that of calcineurin. Thus, the regulation of CaM localization/targeting within dendritic spines by Ng may provide a mechanistic basis for the regulation of metaplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spaced Training Enhances Contextual Fear Memory via Activating Hippocampal 5-HT2A Receptors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spaced training is robustly superior to massed training, which is a well-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. However, the mechanisms underlying the spacing effect still remain unclear. We have reported previously that spacing training exerts memory-enhancing effects by inhibiting forgetting via decreasing hippocampal Rac1 activity. Here, using contextual fear conditioning in rat, we found that spaced but not massed training increased hippocampal 5-HT2A receptors’ expression. Furthermore, hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL11939 before spaced training blocked the enhanced memory, while hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 before massed training promoted the memory. Moreover, MDL11939 activated hippocampal Rac1, while TCB-2 decreased hippocampal Rac1 activity in naïve rats. These results indicated the possibility of interaction between 5-HT2A receptors and Rac1, which was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Our study first demonstrates that activation of hippocampal 5-HT2A is a mechanism underlying the spacing effect, and forgetting related molecular Rac1 is engaged in this process through interacting with 5-HT2A receptors, which suggest a promising strategy to modulate abnormal learning in cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Afterdischarges of Spinal Interneurons Following a Brief High-Frequency Stimulation of Ia Afferents in the Cat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal motoneurons exhibit sustained afterdischarges and plateau potentials following a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents. Also, there is evidence that spinal cord interneurons exhibit plateau potentials. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports about the possible afterdischarge behavior of lumbar spinal interneurons activated by Ia afferents. Given that there are spinal interneurons receiving monosynaptic inputs from Ia afferents, these cells could then be activated in parallel to motoneurons after repetitive muscle stretch. We explored this possibility in cats with a precollicular-postmammillary decerebration. We found that a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents produces afterdischarges that are highly correlated to a DC slow potential recorded at the cord dorsum. We conclude that in the cat spinal cord, not only the motoneurons but also the interneurons from the superficial and deep dorsal horn produce sustained afterdischarges, thus highlighting the importance of interneurons in the spinal neuronal circuitry. The significance of our finding is that it opens the possibility that the spinal cord interneurons activated by Ia afferents could also exhibit bistability, a relevant phenomenon well-characterized in the motoneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Shape Information Improves the Cross-Cohort Performance of Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL) based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation and (3) a second U-Net based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups (AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls) from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Efficacy of Self-Management Smartphone-Based Apps for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent in both civilian and military service members. As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manual brain tumor annotation process is time consuming and resource consuming, therefore, an automated and accurate brain tumor segmentation tool is greatly in demand. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to integrate location information with the state-of-the-art patch-based neural networks for brain tumor segmentation. This is motivated by the observation that lesions are not uniformly distributed across different brain parcellation regions and that a locality-sensitive segmentation is likely to obtain better segmentation accuracy. Toward this, we use an existing brain parcellation atlas in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and map this atlas to the individual subject data. This mapped atlas in the subject data space is integrated with structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data, and patch-based neural networks, including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic, are trained to classify the different brain lesions. Multiple state-of-the-art neural networks are trained and integrated with XGBoost fusion in the proposed two-level ensemble method. The first level reduces the uncertainty of the same type of models with different seed initializations, and the second level leverages the advantages of different types of neural network models. The proposed location information fusion method improves the segmentation performance of state-of-the-art networks including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic. Our proposed ensemble also achieves better segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2017 and rivals state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2018. Detailed results are provided on the public multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Assessing Brain Networks by Resting-State Dynamic Functional Connectivity: An fNIRS-EEG Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The coordination of brain activity between disparate neural populations is highly dynamic. Investigations into intrinsic brain organization by evaluating dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (dRSFC) have attracted great attention in recent years. However, there are few dRSFC studies based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) even though it has some advantages for studying the temporal evolution of brain function. In this research, we recruited 20 young adults and measured their resting-state brain fluctuations in several areas of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes using fNIRS-electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneous recording. Based on a sliding-window approach, we found that the variability of the dRSFC within any region of interest was significantly lower than the connections between region of interests but noticeably greater than the correlation between the channels with a short interoptode distance, which mainly consist of physiological fluctuations occurring in the superficial layers. Furthermore, based on a time-resolved k-means clustering analysis, the temporal evolution was extracted for three dominant functional networks. These networks were roughly consistent between different subject subgroups and in varying sliding time window lengths of 20, 30, and 60 s. Between these three functional networks, there were obvious time-varied and system-specific synchronous relationships. In addition, the oscillation of the frontal-parietal-temporal network showed significant correlation with the switching of one EEG microstate, a finding which is consistent with a previous functional MRI-EEG study. All this evidence implies the functional significance of fNIRS-dRSFC and demonstrates the feasibility of fNIRS for extracting the dominant functional networks based on RSFC dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Training Program to Improve Human Spatial Orientation: Preliminary Findings</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to form a mental representation of the surroundings is a critical skill for spatial navigation and orientation in humans. Such a mental representation is known as a “cognitive map” and is formed as individuals familiarize themselves with the surrounding, providing detailed information about salient environmental landmarks and their spatial relationships. Despite evidence of the malleability and potential for training spatial orientation skills in humans, it remains unknown if the specific ability to form cognitive maps can be improved by an appositely developed training program. Here, we present a newly developed computerized 12-days training program in a virtual environment designed specifically to stimulate the acquisition of this important skill. We asked 15 healthy volunteers to complete the training program and perform a comprehensive spatial behavioral assessment before and after the training. We asked participants to become familiar with the environment by navigating a small area before slowly building them up to navigate within the larger and more complex environment; we asked them to travel back and forth between environmental landmarks until they had built an understanding of where those landmarks resided with respect to one another. This process repeated until participants had visited every landmark in the virtual town and had learned where each landmark resided with respect to the others. The results of this study confirmed the feasibility of the training program and suggested an improvement in the ability of participants to form mental representations of the spatial surrounding. This study provides preliminary findings on the feasibility of a 12-days program in training spatial orientation skills. We discuss the utility and potential impact of this training program in the lives of the many individuals affected by topographical disorientation as a result of an acquired or developmental condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Test a Network Model of Perceptual Decision Making in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00004</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): −200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at −200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Semantic Memory and the Hippocampus: Revisiting, Reaffirming, and Extending the Reach of Their Critical Relationship</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00471</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since Tulving proposed a distinction in memory between semantic and episodic memory, considerable effort has been directed towards understanding their similar and unique features. Of particular interest has been the extent to which semantic and episodic memory have a shared dependence on the hippocampus. In contrast to the definitive evidence for the link between hippocampus and episodic memory, the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory has been a topic of considerable debate. This debate stems, in part, from highly variable reports of new semantic memory learning in amnesia ranging from profound impairment to full preservation, and various degrees of deficit and ability in between. More recently, a number of significant advances in experimental methods have occurred, alongside new provocative data on the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory, making this an ideal moment to revisit this debate, to re-evaluate data, methods, and theories, and to synthesize new findings. In line with these advances, this review has two primary goals. First, we provide a historical lens with which to reevaluate and contextualize the literature on semantic memory and the hippocampus. The second goal of this review is to provide a synthesis of new findings on the role of the hippocampus and semantic memory. With the perspective of time and this critical review, we arrive at the interpretation that the hippocampus does indeed make necessary contributions to semantic memory. We argue that semantic memory, like episodic memory, is a highly flexible, (re)constructive, relational and multimodal system, and that there is value in developing methods and materials that fully capture this depth and richness to facilitate comparisons to episodic memory. Such efforts will be critical in addressing questions regarding the cognitive and neural (inter)dependencies among forms of memory, and the role that these forms of memory play in support of cognition more broadly. Such efforts also promise to advance our understanding of how words, concepts, and meaning, as well as episodes and events, are instantiated and maintained in memory and will yield new insights into our two most quintessentially human abilities: memory and language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Saccade Latency Provides Evidence for Reduced Face Inversion Effects With Higher Autism Traits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00470</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals on the autism spectrum are reported to show impairments in the processing of social information, including aspects of eye-movements towards faces. Abnormalities in basic-level visual processing are also reported. In the current study, we sought to determine if the latency of saccades made towards social targets (faces) in a natural scene as opposed to inanimate targets (cars) would be related to sub-clinical autism traits (ATs) in individuals drawn from a neurotypical population. The effect of stimulus inversion was also examined given that difficulties with processing inverted faces are thought to be a function of face expertise. No group differences in saccadic latency were established for face or car targets, regardless of image orientation. However, as expected, we found that individuals with higher autism-like traits did not demonstrate a saccadic face inversion effect, but those with lower autism-like traits did. Neither group showed a car inversion effect. Thus, these results suggest that neurotypical individuals with high autism-like traits also show anomalies in detecting and orienting to faces. In particular, the reduced saccadic face inversion effect established in these participants with high ATs suggests that speed of visual processing and orienting towards faces may be associated with the social difficulties found across the broader autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Controlling Unpleasant Thoughts: Adjustments of Cognitive Control Based on Previous-Trial Load in a Working Memory Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00469</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic cognitive control adjustments are important for integrating thoughts and actions that take place during dynamic changes of environmental demands and support goal-directed behavior. We investigated, in a working memory (WM) paradigm, whether dynamic adjustments in cognitive control based on previous trial load influence the neural response to neutral or unpleasant distracters. We also investigated whether individual self-reported abilities in controlling thoughts influence this effect. Participants performed a WM change detection task with low or high WM-related cognitive demands. An unpleasant or a neutral distractive image was presented at the beginning of each trial, prior to the WM task. We tested for control adjustments that were associated with the load level of the preceding trial task (N-1) on the neural response to the subsequent distractive image. We found an effect of the prior WM task load on a parieto-occipital waveform event-related potential (ERP) that appeared between 200 and 300 ms after the neutral distracter onset. This effect was not observed for the unpleasant distracter. Individual ability for controlling thoughts may influence the effect of cognitive control adjustments on distracter processing during the unpleasant condition. These findings provide evidence that: (1) dynamic cognitive control adjustments are impaired by unpleasant distracters; and (2) the ability to control unpleasant thoughts is linked to individual differences in flexible cognitive control adjustments and shielding of WM representations from unpleasant distracters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Novel Volumetric Sub-region Segmentation in Brain Tumors</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00003</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A novel deep learning based model called Multi-Planar Spatial Convolutional Neural Network (MPS-CNN) is proposed for effective, automated segmentation of different sub-regions viz. peritumoral edema (ED), necrotic core (NCR), enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core (ET/NET), from multi-modal MR images of the brain. An encoder-decoder type CNN model is designed for pixel-wise segmentation of the tumor along three anatomical planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) at the slice level. These are then combined, by incorporating a consensus fusion strategy with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) based post-refinement, to produce the final volumetric segmentation of the tumor and its constituent sub-regions. Concepts, such as spatial-pooling and unpooling are used to preserve the spatial locations of the edge pixels, for reducing segmentation error around the boundaries. A new aggregated loss function is also developed for effectively handling data imbalance. The MPS-CNN is trained and validated on the recent Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The Dice scores obtained for the validation set for whole tumor (WT :NCR/NE +ET +ED), tumor core (TC:NCR/NET +ET), and enhancing tumor (ET) are 0.90216, 0.87247, and 0.82445. The proposed MPS-CNN is found to perform the best (based on leaderboard scores) for ET and TC segmentation tasks, in terms of both the quantitative measures (viz. Dice and Hausdorff). In case of the WT segmentation it also achieved the second highest accuracy, with a score which was only 1% less than that of the best performing method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Epilepsy of Infancy With Migrating Focal Seizures: Identification of de novo Mutations of the KCNT2 Gene That Exert Inhibitory Effects on the Corresponding Heteromeric KNa1.1/KNa1.2 Potassium Channel</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00001</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS; previously called Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy) are early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEE) that associate multifocal ictal discharges and profound psychomotor retardation. EIMFS have a genetic origin and are mostly caused by de novo mutations in the KCNT1 gene, and much more rarely in the KCNT2 gene. KCNT1 and KCNT2 respectively encode the K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 (Slack) and K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 (Slick) subunits of the sodium-dependent voltage-gated potassium channel K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;. Functional analyses of the corresponding mutant homomeric channels in vitro suggested gain-of-function effects. Here, we report two novel, de novo truncating mutations of KCNT2: one mutation is frameshift (p.L48Qfs43), is situated in the N-terminal domain, and was found in a patient with EOEE (possibly EIMFS); the other mutation is nonsense (p.K564*), is located in the C-terminal region, and was found in a typical EIMFS patient. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we have analyzed the functional consequences of those two novel KCNT2 mutations on reconstituted K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 homomeric and K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;1.1/K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 heteromeric channels in transfected chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We report that both mutations significantly impacted on K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; function; notably, they decreased the global current density of heteromeric channels by ~25% (p.K564*) and ~55% (p.L48Qfs43). Overall our data emphasize the involvement of KCNT2 in EOEE and provide novel insights into the role of heteromeric K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; channel in the severe KCNT2-related epileptic phenotypes. This may have important implications regarding the elaboration of future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Y172 Monoclonal Antibody Against p-c-Jun (Ser63) Is a Marker of the Postsynaptic Compartment of C-Type Cholinergic Afferent Synapses on Motoneurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;C-bouton-type cholinergic afferents exert an important function in controlling motoneuron (MN) excitability. During the immunocytochemical analysis of the role of c-Jun in MNs with a monoclonal (clone Y172) antibody against phospho (p)-c-Jun (serine [Ser]63), unexpected labeling was identified in the cell body cytoplasm. As predicted for c-Jun in adult spinal cord, very few, if any MNs exhibited nuclear immunoreactivity with the Y172 antibody; conversely, virtually all MNs displayed strong Y172 immunostaining in cytoplasmic structures scattered throughout the soma and proximal dendrites. The majority of these cytoplasmic Y172-positive profiles was closely associated with VAChT-positive C-boutons, but not with other types of nerve afferents contacting MNs. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cytoplasmic Y172 immunostaining was selectively located at the subsurface cistern (SSC) of C-boutons and also in the inner areas of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We also described changes in cytoplasmic Y172 immunoreactivity in injured and degenerating MNs. Moreover, we noticed that MNs from NRG1 type III-overexpressing transgenic mice, which show abnormally expanded SSCs, exhibited an increase in the density and size of peripherally located Y172-positive profiles. A similar immunocytochemical pattern to that of the Y172 antibody in MNs was found with a polyclonal antibody against p-c-Jun (Ser63) but not with another polyclonal antibody that recognizes c-Jun phosphorylated at a different site. No differential band patterns were found by western blotting with any of the antibodies against c-Jun or p-c-Jun used in our study. In cultured MNs, Y172-positive oval profiles were distributed in the cell body and proximal dendrites. The in vitro lentiviral-based knockdown of c-Jun resulted in a dramatic decrease in nuclear Y172 immunostaining in MNs without any reduction in the density of cytoplasmic Y172-positive profiles, suggesting that the synaptic antigen recognized by the antibody corresponds to a C-bouton-specific protein other than p-c-Jun. Our results lay the foundation for further studies aimed at identifying this protein and determining its role in this particular type of synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Creating a functional cerebral cortex requires a series of complex and well-coordinated developmental steps. These steps have evolved across species with the emergence of cortical gyrification and coincided with more complex behaviors. The presence of diverse progenitor cells, a protracted timeline for neuronal migration and maturation, and diverse neuronal types are developmental features that have emerged in the gyrated cortex. These factors could explain how the human brain has expanded in size and complexity. However, their complex nature also renders new avenues of vulnerability by providing additional cell types that could contribute to disease and longer time windows that could impact the composition and organization of the cortical circuit. We aim to discuss the unique developmental steps observed in human corticogenesis and propose how disruption of these species-unique processes could lead to malformations of cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>RNA granules are protein/RNA condensates. How specific mRNAs are recruited to cytoplasmic RNA granules is not known. Here we characterize the transcriptome and assembly of P granules, RNA granules in the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;germ plasm. We find that P granules recruit mRNAs by condensation with the disordered protein MEG-3. MEG-3 traps mRNAs into non-dynamic condensates &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and binds to ~500 mRNAs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a sequence-independent manner that favors embryonic mRNAs with low ribosome coverage. Translational stress causes additional mRNAs to localize to P granules and translational activation correlates with P granule exit for two mRNAs coding for germ cell fate regulators. Localization to P granules is not required for translational repression but is required to enrich mRNAs in the germ lineage for robust germline development. Our observations reveal similarities between P granules and stress granules and identify intrinsically-disordered proteins as drivers of RNA condensation during P granule assembly.</description>

	<description>Lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent neurons modulate auditory nerve fiber (ANF) activity using a large repertoire of neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh). Little is known about how individual neurotransmitter systems are differentially utilized in response to the ever-changing acoustic environment. Here we present quantitative evidence in rodents that the dopaminergic LOC input to ANFs is dynamically regulated according to the animal's recent acoustic experience. Sound exposure upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for dopamine synthesis, in cholinergic LOC intrinsic neurons, suggesting that individual LOC neurons might at times co-release ACh and DA. We further demonstrate that dopamine down-regulates ANF firing rates by reducing both the hair cell release rate and the size of synaptic events. Collectively, our results suggest that LOC intrinsic neurons can undergo on-demand neurotransmitter re-specification to re-calibrate ANF activity, adjust the gain at hair cell/ANF synapses, and possibly to protect these synapses from noise damage.</description>

	<description>Angiogenesis requires the temporal coordination of the proliferation and the migration of endothelial cells. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in harmonizing angiogenesis processes in a three-dimensional in vitro model. We described a microRNA network which contributes to the observed down- and upregulation of proliferative and migratory genes, respectively. Global analysis of miRNA–target gene interactions identified two sub-network modules, the first organized in upregulated miRNAs connected with downregulated target genes and the second with opposite features. miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p were selected for the network validation. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches targeting these microRNAs impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that these modules are instrumental to the temporal coordination of endothelial migration and proliferation. Interestingly, miR-29a-3p and its targets belong to a selective biomarker that is able to identify colorectal cancer patients who are responding to anti-angiogenic treatments. Our results provide a view of higher-order interactions in angiogenesis that has potential to provide diagnostic and therapeutic insights.</description>

	<description>Specific, peripheral C-tactile afferents contribute to the perception of tactile pleasure, but the brain areas involved in their processing remain debated. We report the first human lesion study on the perception of C-tactile touch in right hemisphere stroke patients (N = 59), revealing that right posterior and anterior insula lesions reduce tactile, contralateral and ipsilateral pleasantness sensitivity, respectively. These findings corroborate previous imaging studies regarding the role of the posterior insula in the perception of affective touch. However, our findings about the crucial role of the anterior insula for ipsilateral affective touch perception open new avenues of enquiry regarding the cortical organization of this tactile system.</description>

	<description>The Bcl-2 family BH3 protein Bim promotes apoptosis at mitochondria by activating the pore-forming proteins Bax and Bak and by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Bim binds to these proteins via its BH3 domain and to the mitochondrial membrane by a carboxyl-terminal sequence (CTS). In cells killed by Bim, the expression of a Bim mutant in which the CTS was deleted (BimL-dCTS) triggered apoptosis that correlated with inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins being sufficient to permeabilize mitochondria isolated from the same cells. Detailed analysis of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that BimL-dCTS inhibited Bcl-XL but did not activate Bax. Examination of additional point mutants unexpectedly revealed that the CTS of Bim directly interacts with Bax, is required for physiological concentrations of Bim to activate Bax and that different residues in the CTS enable Bax activation and binding to membranes.</description>

	<description>Neocortical-hippocampal interactions support new episodic (event) memories, but there is conflicting evidence about the dependence of remote episodic memories on the hippocampus. In line with systems consolidation and computational theories of episodic memory, evidence from model organisms suggests that the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) hippocampal subfield supports recent, but not remote, episodic retrieval. In this study, we demonstrated that recent and remote memories were susceptible to a loss of episodic detail in human participants with focal bilateral damage to CA3. Graph theoretic analyses of 7.0-Tesla resting-state fMRI data revealed that CA3 damage disrupted functional integration across the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem of the default network. The loss of functional integration in MTL subsystem regions was predictive of autobiographical episodic retrieval performance. We conclude that human CA3 is necessary for the retrieval of episodic memories long after their initial acquisition and functional integration of the default network is important for autobiographical episodic memory performance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Assessing Goodness-of-Fit in Marked-Point Process Models of Neural Population Coding via Time and Rate Rescaling</title>

	<description>Marked-point process models have recently been used to capture the coding properties of neural populations from multi-unit electrophysiological recordings without spike sorting. These clusterless models have been shown in some instances to better describe the firing properties of neural populations than collections of receptive field models for sorted neurons and to lead to better decoding results. To assess their quality, we previously proposed a goodness-of-fit technique for marked-point process models based on time-rescaling, which for a correct model, produces a set of uniform samples over a random region of space. However, assessing uniformity over such a region can be challenging, especially in high dimensions. Here, we propose a set of new transformations both in time and in the space of spike waveform features, which generate events that are uniformly distributed in the new mark and time spaces. These transformations are scalable to multi-dimensional mark spaces and provide uniformly distributed samples in hypercubes, which are well suited for uniformity tests. We discuss properties of these transformations and demonstrate aspects of model fit captured by each transformation. We also compare multiple uniformity tests to determine their power to identify lack-of-fit in the rescaled data. We demonstrate an application of these transformations and uniformity tests in a simulation study. Proofs for each transformation are provided in the Appendix section. We have made the MATLAB code used for the analyses in this paper publicly available through our Github repository at https://github.com/YousefiLab/Marked-PointProcess-Goodness-of-Fit.</description>

	<description>The contribution of astrocytes to the BOLD fMRI and DfMRI responses in visual cortex of mice following visual stimulation were investigated an aquaporin 4 (AQP4) channel blocker, TGN-020, acting as an astrocyte function perturbator. Under TGN-020 injection the amplitude of the BOLD fMRI response became significantly higher.In contrast, no significant changes in the DfMRI responses and the electrophysiological responses were observed. Those results further confirm the implications of astrocytes in the neurovascular coupling mechanism underlying BOLD fMRI, while DfMRI relies on other, not astrocyte-mediated mechanisms.</description>

	<description>Dendrites of pyramidal neurons integrate different sensory inputs, and non-linear dendritic computations drive feature selective tuning and plasticity. Yet little is known about how dendrites themselves represent the environment, the degree to which they are coupled to their soma, and how that coupling is sculpted with experience. In order to answer these questions, we developed a novel preparation in which we image soma and connected dendrites in a single plane across days using in vivo two-photon microscopy. Using this preparation, we monitored spatially tuned activity in area CA3 of the hippocampus in head-fixed mice running on a linear track. We identified 'place dendrites', which can stably and precisely represent both familiar and novel spatial environments. Dendrites could display place tuning independent of their connected soma and even their sister dendritic branches, the first evidence for branch-specific tuning in the hippocampus. In a familiar environment, spatially tuned somata were more decoupled from their dendrites as compared to non-tuned somata. This relationship was absent in a novel environment, suggesting an experience dependent selective gating of dendritic spatial inputs. We then built a data-driven multicompartment computational model that could capture the experimentally observed correlations. Our model predicts that place cells exhibiting branch-specific tuning have more flexible place fields, while neurons with homogenous or co-tuned dendritic branches have higher place field stability. These findings demonstrate that spatial representation is organized in a branch-specific manner within dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Further, spatial inputs from dendrites to soma are selectively and dynamically gated in an experience-dependent manner, endowing both flexibility and stability to the cognitive map of space.</description>

	<description>Phase contrast MRI has been used to investigate flow pulsatility in cerebral arteries, larger cerebral veins and the cerebrospinal fluid. Such measurements of intracranial pulsatility and compliance are beginning to inform understanding of the pathophysiology of conditions including normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis and dementias. We demonstrate the presence of flow pulsatility in small cerebral cortical veins, for the first time using phase contrast MRI at 7 Tesla, with the aim of improving our understanding of the haemodynamics of this little-studied vascular compartment. An automated method for establishing where venous flow is pulsatile is introduced, revealing significant pulsatility in 116 out of 146 veins, across 8 healthy participants, assessed in parietal and frontal regions. Distributions of pulsatility index and pulse waveform delay were characterized, indicating a small, but statistically significant (p&amp;lt;0.05), delay of 59{+/-}41 ms in cortical veins with respect to the superior sagittal sinus, but no differences between veins draining different arterial supply territories. Measurements of pulsatility in smaller cortical veins, a hitherto unstudied compartment closer to the capillary bed, could lead to a better understanding of intracranial compliance and cerebrovascular (patho)physiology.</description>

	<description>Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) enables noninvasive targeted intervention in brain activation with high spatial specificity. To achieve this promise of rtfMRI-nf, we introduced and demonstrated a data-driven framework to design a rtfMRI-nf intervention through the discovery of precise target location associated with clinical symptoms and neurofeedback signal optimization. Specifically, we identified the functional connectivity locus associated with rumination symptoms, utilizing a connectome-wide search in resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of mood and anxiety disorder individuals (N=223) and healthy controls (N=45). Then, we performed a rtfMRI simulation analysis to optimize the online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal for the identified functional connectivity. The connectome-wide search was performed in the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus brain regions to identify the precise location of the functional connectivity associated with rumination severity as measured by the ruminative response style (RRS) scale. The analysis found that the functional connectivity between the loci in the precuneus (-6, -54, 48 mm in MNI) and the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ; 49, -49, 23 mm) was positively correlated with RRS scores (depressive, p &amp;lt; 0.001; brooding, p &amp;lt; 0.001; reflective, p = 0.002) in the mood and anxiety disorder group. We then performed a rtfMRI processing simulation to optimize the online computation of the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. We determined that the two-point method without a control region was appropriate as a functional connectivity neurofeedback signal with less dependence on signal history and its accommodation of head motion. The present framework offers a discovery of the precise location of the functional connectivity target for rtfMRI-nf intervention and would help directly translate the neuroimaging finding into a clinical treatment with rtfMRI-nf.</description>

	<description>Synchrony in developmental science reflects the coordination of mother and child to one another's mental states. Mentalisation processes are influenced by individual attachment styles. A mother with an anxious attachment pattern tends to be hypervigilant to cues of rejection and likely to rely on her child's facial expressions to interpret his/her mental states. We hypothesised that anxiously attached mothers are less able to attune to their child's emotional state during an everyday joint activity, a state reflected in reduced brain-to-brain synchrony. To test this hypothesis, we profiled mothers' Need for Approval (NfA), an index of attachment, and used functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with 31 mother-child dyads to measure prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain-to-brain synchrony while mother-child dyads watched three 1-min animation videos together. Greater maternal NfA is associated with less synchrony in the frontal left and medial left prefrontal clusters, which map to the left lateral PFC. This area of the brain is implicated in mentalisation. Anxiously attached mothers appear to exhibit less brain-to-brain synchrony with their child which indicates less attunement to his/her mental state, potentially undermining the quality of their shared experiences during everyday joint activities.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Divided Attention in Perception:A Unified Analysis of Dual-Task Deficits and Congruency Effects</title>

	<description>How well can one perceive simultaneous stimuli at two widely spaced visual locations? Are the stimuli processed independently? If not, does the dependency affect perception, disrupt signals in later stages, or both? To address these questions, we measured effects of divided attention using a dual-task paradigm with stimuli presented in noise on either side of fixation. This paradigm was applied to detecting Gabor patches and to the semantic categorization of words. We measured dual-task deficits which are a decline in mean performance for a dual task compared to a single task. There was such a deficit for categorizing two words but relatively little deficit for detecting two Gabors. We also measured congruency effects which are when performance at one location depends on whether the stimulus at the other location requires the same response. There was such a congruency effect for detecting two Gabors but relatively little congruency effect for categorizing two words. Further experiments were consistent with the dual-task deficit in word categorization being perceptual, but the congruency effect in Gabor detection being due to later processes. Results of additional experiments showed that the congruency effect was consistent with either graded selection errors or with all-or-none selection followed by graded interactive processing. To answer our opening question: for Gabor detection, perceptual processes were largely independent but later processes caused congruency effects; for word categorization, perceptual processes had capacity limits but even in combination with later processes caused relatively little congruency effects. In summary, there was evidence for two different kinds of dependency. Such complementary dependencies are inconsistent with theories of divided attention that depend on a single dependency such as a single resource or single source of interactive processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cities have a negative impact on navigation ability: evidence from 38 countries</title>

	<description>Research on brain plasticity supports the notion that experience can shape brain structure as well as function. In particular, cultural and geographical properties of the environment have been shown to deeply influence cognition and mental health. In rodents, exploring complex environments has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition. In humans, spatial navigation activates the hippocampus, and continuous navigation of a large complex city environment increases posterior hippocampal volume. While living near green spaces has been found to be strongly beneficial, urban residence has been associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders. However, how the environment experienced during childhood and early life impacts later cognitive abilities remains poorly understood for two reasons. First, human environments are manifold and much harder to characterize than a rodent's cage. Second, gathering cognitive testing of large samples from populations living in different environments is very costly. To overcome these limitations, we measured non-verbal spatial navigation ability in 3.9 million people across all countries and examined a subset of this data (442,195 people, in 38 countries). We used a cognitive task embedded in a video game, that is predictive of real-world navigation skill. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures, and parallels to rodent studies. We quantified the complexity of participants' environment with OSMnx, a tool giving access to the street network topology of cities anywhere in the world. We found that on average, people who reported having grown up cities have worse navigation skills than those who reported growing up outside cities, even when controlling for age, gender, and level of education. This effect varied across countries, being for instance more than 6 times larger in the USA than in Romania. To investigate these variations we computed the average Street Network Entropy (SNE) of the biggest cities of 38 countries: grid-like cities (e.g. Chicago) have a small SNE, while more organic cities (e.g. Prague) have a higher one. We find a correlation between the average SNE and the extent to which growing up in a city negatively impacts spatial navigation ability. People growing up in countries with lower average SNE (griddy cities) have comparatively worse spatial abilities than their rural compatriots. This confirms the impact of the environment on human cognition on a global scale, and highlights the importance of urban design on human cognition and brain function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A high-density narrow-field inhibitory retinal interneuron with direct coupling to Müller glia</title>

	<description>Amacrine cells are interneurons comprising the most diverse cell type in the mammalian retina. They help encode visual features such as edges or directed motion by mediating excitatory and inhibitory interactions between input (i.e. bipolar) and output (i.e. ganglion) neurons in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Like other brain regions, the retina also contains glial cells that contribute to neurotransmitter uptake, neurovascular control and metabolic regulation. Here, we report that a previously poorly characterized, but relatively abundant, inhibitory amacrine cell type in the mouse retina is coupled directly to Muller glia. Electron microscopic reconstructions of this amacrine type revealed extensive associations with Muller glia, whose processes often completely ensheathe the neurites of this amacrine cell type. Microinjections of small tracer molecules into the somas of these amacrine cells led to selective labelling of nearby Muller glia, leading us to suggest the name 'Muller glia-coupled amacrine cell' or MAC. Our electrophysiological data also indicate that MACs release glycine at conventional chemical synapses with amacrine, bipolar and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and viral transsynaptic tracing showed connections to several known RGC types. Visually-evoked responses revealed a strong preference for light increments; these ON responses were primarily mediated by excitatory chemical synaptic input and direct electrical coupling to other cells. This initial characterization of the MAC provides the first evidence for neuron-glia coupling in the mammalian retina and identifies the MAC as a potential link between inhibitory processing and glial function.</description>

	<description>Attention is subjectively experienced as a unified cognitive effort. This unitary experience of attention contrasts with the diversity of neural and peripheral correlates of attention. While the effects of attention on stimulus-evoked responses, alpha oscillations and pupil diameter are well-known, the relationship between these indices and the subjective experience of attention, has not yet been assessed. Participants performed a sustained (10 s to 30 s) attention task in which rare (10%) targets were detected within continuous tactile stimulation (16Hz). Trials were followed by attention ratings on an 8-point Likert scale. Steady-state evoked fields (SSSEFs) in response to tactile stimulation, as measured by magnetoencephalography, provided an objective measure of sensory processing. Beamformer source analysis of somatosensory alpha power was used as a measure of cortical excitability, while pupillometry provided a peripheral index of arousal. Attention ratings correlated negatively with contralateral somatosensory alpha power, and positively with pupil diameter. The effect of pupil diameter on attention ratings extended into the following trial, reflecting a sustained aspect of attention related to vigilance. The effect of alpha power did not carry over to the next trial, and furthermore mediated the effect of pupil diameter on attention ratings. Variation in SSSEF power reflected stimulus processing under the influence of alpha oscillations, but were not readily expressed through subjective ratings of attention. Together, our results show that both alpha power and pupil diameter are reflected in the subjective experience of attention, albeit on different time spans, while continuous stimulus processing might not be metacognitively accessible.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transient amplitude modulation of alpha-band oscillations by short-time intermittent closed-loop tACS</title>

	<description>Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have recently become extensively utilized due to their potential to modulate ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity and consequently to induce cortical plasticity relevant for various cognitive functions. However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences are not yet understood. In the present study we used a closed-loop EEG transcranial alternating current stimulation protocol (EEG-tACS) to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened) but not high (eyes closed). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtained via the estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulated via closed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.</description>

	<description>Ariadne-1 (Ari-1) is an essential E3 ubiquitin-ligase whose neuronal substrates are yet to be identified. We have used an in vivo ubiquitin biotinylation strategy coupled to quantitative proteomics to identify putative Ari-1 substrates in Drosophila heads. Sixteen candidates met the established criteria. Amongst those, we identified Comatose (Comt), the homologue of the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF). Using an in vivo GFP pulldown approach, we validate Comt/NSF to be an ubiquitination substrate of Ari-1 in fly neurons. The interaction results in the monoubiquitination of Comt/NSF. We also report that Ari-1 loss of function mutants display a lower rate of spontaneous neurotransmitter release due to failures at the pre-synaptic side. By contrast, evoked release in Ari-1 mutants is enhanced in a Ca2+ dependent manner without modifications in the number of active zones, indicating that the probability of release per synapse is increased in these mutants. The distinct Ari-1 mutant phenotypes in spontaneous versus evoked release indicate that NSF activity discriminates the two corresponding protein ensembles that mediate each mode of release. Our results, thus, provide a mechanism to regulate NSF activity in the synapse through Ari-1-dependent ubiquitination.</description>

	<description>Cocaine addiction is a brain disorder characterized by the consumption of the drug despite harmful consequences, the loss of control over drug intake and increased risk of relapse. Albeit prolonged research efforts, there is no available medication approved for the treatment of cocaine addiction. In the last decade, cannabinoid-based compounds have drawn increased interest for its potential therapeutic applications in various psychiatric conditions. Cannabidiol, a non-psychotomimetic constituent of the C. sativa plant, shows promising results in rodent models of anxiety, schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction. However, the specific effects and mechanisms of action of cannabidiol in a rodent model of extinction-based abstinence and drug seeking relapse remain unclear. Here, we administered cannabidiol (20 mg/kg) to male CD-1 mice trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg/inf) during extinction training (8-12 days). Then, we evaluated the reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by cues, stress and drug priming. To ascertain the participation of CB1 receptors in these behavioral responses, we systemically administered the neutral cannabinoid antagonist AM4113 (5 mg/kg) before each reinstatement session. The results document that cannabidiol (20 mg/kg) does not modulate extinction training but attenuates extinction bursting behavior after one cannabidiol injection. Furthermore, cannabidiol specifically blocked the reinstatement of cocaine seeking triggered by a cue presentation, an effect prevented by AM4113 (5 mg/kg). Unexpectedly, cannabidiol facilitated stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking behavior, also by a CB1-dependent mechanism. Finally, cannabidiol did not affect cocaine-primed (10 mg/kg) precipitation of cocaine seeking. Our results reveal a series of complex changes induced by cannabidiol treatment with opposite implications for the reinstatement of cocaine seeking behavior that may limit therapeutic opportunities. The activity of CB1 receptors seems to play a crucial role in the expression of cannabidiol-induced neuroplasticity underlying both the desirable and undesirable reinstatement effects here detailed.</description>

	<description>The transformation of sensory inputs to appropriate goal-directed actions requires estimation of sensory-cue values based on outcome history. To clarify how cortical neurons represent an outcome-predicting cue and actual outcome, we conducted wide-field and two-photon calcium imaging of the mouse neocortex during performance of a classical conditioning task with two cues with different water-reward probabilities. Although licking behavior dominated the area-averaged activity over the whole dorsal neocortex, dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFrC) affected other dorsal frontal cortical activities, and its inhibition extinguished differences in anticipatory licking between the cues. In individual frontal cortical neurons, the reward-predicting cue was not simultaneously represented with the current or past reward, but licking behavior was frequently multiplexed with the reward-predicting cue and current or past reward. Deep-layer neurons in dmFrC most strongly represented the reward-predicting cue and recent reward history. Our results suggest that these neurons ignite the cortical processes required to select appropriate actions.</description>

	<description>Transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo) interacts with the atypical cadherin Flamingo to direct R8 photoreceptor axons in the Drosophila visual system. However, the precise mechanisms underlying Gogo regulation during columnar- and layer-specific R8 axon targeting are unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the insulin secreted from surface and cortex glia switches the phosphorylation status of Gogo, thereby regulating its two distinct functions in this process. Nonphosphorylated Gogo mediates the initial recognition of the glial protrusion in the center of the medulla column, whereas phosphorylated Gogo suppresses horizontal filopodia extension by counteracting Flamingo to maintain one axon to one column ratio. Later, Gogo expression ceases during the midpupal developmental stage, thus allowing R8 filopodia to extend vertically into the M3 layer. These results demonstrate that the long- and short-range signaling between the glia and R8 axon growth cones regulates growth cone dynamics in a stepwise manner, and thus shape the entire organization of the visual system's functional neuronal circuit.</description>

	<description>Interactions between neurons, astrocytes, and microglia critically influence neuroinflammatory responses to insult in the central nervous system. Studying neuroinflammation in vitro has been difficult because most primary culture models do not include all three critical cell types. We describe an in vitro model of neuroinflammation comprised of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Primary rat cortical cells were cultured in a serum-free medium used to co-culture neurons and astrocytes that is supplemented with three factors (IL-34, TGF-{beta}, and cholesterol) used to support isolated microglia. This &quot;tri-culture&quot; can be maintained for at least 14 days in vitro while retaining a physiologically-relevant representation of all three cell types. Additionally, we demonstrate that the tri-culture system responds to lipopolysaccharide, mechanical trauma and excitotoxicity with both neurotoxic and neuroprotective aspects of the neuroinflammatory response observed in vivo. We expect the tri-culture model will enable mechanistic studies of neuroinflammation in vitro with enhanced physiological relevance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: When honest people cheat, and cheaters are honest: Cognitive control processes override our moral default</title>

	<description>Every day, we are faced with the conflict between the temptation to cheat for financial gains and maintaining a positive image of ourselves as being a good person. While it has been proposed that cognitive control is needed to mediate this conflict between reward and our moral self-image, the exact role of cognitive control in (dis)honesty remains elusive. Here, we identify this role, by investigating the neural mechanism underlying cheating. We developed a novel task which allows for inconspicuously measuring spontaneous cheating on a trial-by-trial basis in the MRI scanner. We found that activity in the Nucleus Accumbens promotes cheating, particularly for individuals who cheat a lot, while a network consisting of Posterior Cingulate Cortex, Temporoparietal Junction and Medial Prefrontal Cortex promotes honesty, particularly in individuals who are generally honest. Finally, activity in areas associated with Cognitive Control (Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Inferior Frontal Gyrus) helped dishonest participants to be honest, whereas it promoted cheating for honest participants. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive control is not needed to be honest or dishonest per se, but that it depends on an individual's moral default.</description>

The last decade has witnessed a remarkable increase in our ability to measure genetic information. Advancements of sequencing technologies are challenging the existing methods of data storage and analysis. While methods to cope with the data deluge are progressing, many biologists have lagged behind due to the fast pace of computational advancements and tools available to address their scientific questions. Future generations of biologists must be more computationally aware and capable. This means they should be trained to give them the computational skills to keep pace with technological developments. Here, we propose a model that bridges experimental and bioinformatics concepts using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform. We provide both a guide to begin to empower the new generation of educators, scientists, and students in performing long-read assembly of bacterial and bacteriophage genomes and a standalone virtual machine containing all the required software and learning materials for the course.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_KTMj8f9HUs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological research in MS has mainly been performed in socioeconomically and ethnically limited populations; influences on MS risk have not been studied in prospectively collected non‐White populations. We set out to study the influence of previously described MS risk factors in an ethnically diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nested case‐control study was created using primary care records of over 1 million individuals, &amp;gt;50% of whom identify as Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME). MS cases were compared to an age and sex‐matched control cohort (1:4), and to a large unmatched cohort. Odds ratios of disease were determined according to exposure of interest and a multivariable model including all exposures was created. Potential pairwise interactions were considered where both indicated a significant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1344 confirmed MS cases were included. MS odds in Blacks aged &amp;lt;40 were 1.15 (0.81‐1.62) compared to Whites. MS odds in BAME current (OR 1.71, 95%CI 1.24‐2.31) and ex‐smokers (OR 2.83, 95%CI 2.14‐3.72) were considerably higher than Whites (OR 1.09 95%CI 0.88‐1.34; OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.19‐1.74 respectively). Prior infectious mononucleosis (IM) was associated with increased odds of MS in Blacks (OR 4.94 95%CI 1.23‐17.89). An increase in MS odds was seen in the least‐deprived quintile (OR 2.46 95%CI 1.40‐4.24), but no effect across deprived quintiles was seen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cohort provides novel data on factors potentially driving MS susceptibility in a diverse population, a third of whom live in poverty. Environmental exposures have differential risk across ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Direct comparison of odor responses of homologous glomeruli in the medial and lateral maps of the mouse olfactory bulb</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Olfactory sensory neurons expressing same-type odorant receptors typically project to a pair of glomeruli in the medial and lateral sides of the olfactory bulbs (OBs) in rodents. This multiple glomerular representation of homologous inputs is considered to have more important functional roles for odor information processing than the redundant backup system. However, a consensus idea is lacking and this hinders interpretation of the phenomenon. In addition, the shared and unique odorant response properties of the homologous glomeruli remain unclear because the majority of medial glomeruli are hidden in the septal OB, and thus it is difficult to directly compare them. Olfactory sensory neurons, which express trace amine-associated odorant receptors (TAARs), were recently identified that project to a pair of glomeruli uniquely located in the dorsal OB. In this study, we measured the odorant-induced calcium responses of homologous pairs of TAAR glomeruli simultaneously in anesthetized mice and directly compared their response patterns. We found that they exhibited similar temporal response patterns and could not find differences in onset latency, rise time, decay time, or response amplitude. However, the medial glomeruli had significantly larger respiration-locked calcium fluctuations than the lateral glomeruli. This trend was observed with/without odorant stimulation in postsynaptic neurons of GABAergic, dopaminergic, and mitral/tufted cells, but not in presynaptic olfactory sensory axon terminals. This indicates that, at least in these TAAR glomeruli, the medial rather than the lateral OB map enhances the respiration-locked rhythm and transfers this information to higher brain centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study directly compared the odor-evoked responses in paired homologous glomeruli in medial and lateral maps in the mouse dorsal olfactory bulb using the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging technique, which revealed that the response amplitude, onset latency, rising time, and decay time were not significantly different between medial and lateral homologous glomeruli. However, postsynaptic but not presynaptic neuronal activity in medial glomeruli had stronger respiratory-locked calcium fluctuations than lateral glomeruli. These differences were also observed in the resting condition without odor stimulation. The results suggest that the medial map neurons enhance respiratory-linked odor representation and transmit it to higher brain centers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a reliable, noninvasive, and inexpensive tool for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. In this study, we assessed the classification performance of TMS parameters in the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a multicenter study enrolling patients referred to 4 dementia centers in Italy, in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. All patients underwent TMS assessment at recruitment (index test), with application of reference clinical criteria, to predict different neurodegenerative disorders. The investigators who performed the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. We trained and tested a random forest classifier using 5‐fold cross‐validation. The primary outcome measures were the classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of TMS in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 694 participants were included, namely 273 patients diagnosed as AD, 67 as DLB, and 207 as FTD, and 147 healthy controls (HC). A series of 3 binary classifiers was employed, and the prediction model exhibited high classification accuracy (ranging from 0.89 to 0.92), high precision (0.86–0.92), high recall (0.93–0.98), and high F1 scores (0.89–0.95) in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a noninvasive procedure that reliably and selectively distinguishes AD, DLB, FTD, and HC, representing a useful additional screening tool to be used in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Active inference provides a biologically plausible process theory of brain
function. It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a
gradient descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between
an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. When formulated for
discrete state-space generative models, the free energy gradient turns out to
be a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials
of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can
then be expressed in terms of firing rates. We establish a construct validity
to this scheme -- by showing that it is consistent with current models of
neuronal dynamics -- and face validity, as it is able to synthesize a wide
range of biologically plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show
that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known
optimisation algorithm from information geometry that prescribes locally
optimal belief updates. Lastly, numerical simulations suggest that both schemes
perform equally well on average. The performance of belief updating is scored
in terms of information length, a measure of the distance traveled in
information space, which has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic
efficiency. These results show that active inference is consistent with
state-of-the-art models of neuronal dynamics and coincides with the natural
gradient. This suggests that natural selection, by selecting the phenotypes
that optimise metabolic and computational efficiency, has implicitly
approximated the steepest direction in information space; namely, natural
gradient descent.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the primate visual cortices show a wide range of stimulus
selectivity. Some neurons respond to only a small fraction of stimulus images,
whereas others respond to many stimulus images in a non-selective manner. It is
unclear how stimulus selective and non-selective neurons contribute to visual
object recognition. Herein, we examined the relationship between stimulus
selectivity and the effect of deletion of units on task performance using fully
a connected layer of two types of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs).
Deleting a stimulus selective unit caused slight improvements of task
performance, whereas deleting stimulus non-selective units caused a significant
decrease in task performance. However, these findings do not imply that
stimulus selective units have no use for the task. Indeed, better performance
was obtained when the networks consisted of both stimulus selective and
non-selective units.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lack of Neurosteroid Selectivity at δ vs. γ2-Containing GABAA Receptors in Dentate Granule Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors mediate a large fraction of inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Two major classes of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are γ2-containing receptors and δ-containing receptors, which are largely located synaptically and extrasynaptically, respectively. Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3α5αP) and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are hypothesized to selectively affect δ-containing receptors over γ2-containing receptors. However, the selectivity of neurosteroids on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor classes is controversial. In this study, we re-examined this issue using mice with picrotoxin resistance associated with either the δ or γ2 subunit. Our results show that 3α5αP potentiated phasic inhibition of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, and this is mainly through γ2-containing receptors. 3α5αP, with or without exogenous GABA, potentiated tonic inhibition through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Surprisingly, potentiation arose from both γ2- and δ-containing receptors, even when a δ selective agonist THIP was used to activate current. Although ethanol has been proposed to act through neurosteroids and to act selectively at δ receptors, we found no evidence for ethanol potentiation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor function at 50 mM under our experimental conditions. Finally, we found that the actions of pentobarbital exhibited very similar effects on tonic current as 3α5αP, emphasizing the broad spectrum nature of neurosteroid potentiation. Overall, using chemogenetic analysis, our evidence suggests that in a cell population enriched for δ-containing receptors, neurosteroids act through both δ-containing and non-δ-containing receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evaluation of Biochemical and Epigenetic Measures of Peripheral Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) as a Biomarker in Huntington’s Disease Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00335</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative movement disorder that presents with prominent cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of HD, as well as other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, and epigenetic alterations in the complex BDNF promoter have been associated with its deregulation in pathological conditions. BDNF has gained increased attention as a potential biomarker of disease; but currently, the conflicting results from measurements of BDNF in different biofluids difficult the assessment of its utility as a biomarker for HD. Here, we measured BDNF protein levels in plasma (n = 85) and saliva (n = 81) samples from premanifest and manifest HD patients and normal controls using ELISA assays. We further examined DNA methylation levels of BDNF promoter IV using DNA derived from whole blood of HD patients and healthy controls (n = 40) using pyrosequencing. BDNF protein levels were not significantly different in plasma samples across diagnostic groups. Plasma BDNF was significantly correlated with age in control subjects but not in HD patients, nor were significant gender effects observed. Similar to plasma, salivary BDNF was correlated with age only in control subjects, with no gender effects observed. Importantly, we detected significantly lower levels of salivary BDNF in premanifest and manifest HD patients compared to control subjects, with lower BDNF levels being observed in premanifest patients within a predicted 10 years to disease onset. Salivary and plasma BDNF levels were not significantly correlated with one another, suggesting different origins. DNA methylation at four out of the 12 CpG sites studied in promoter IV were significantly altered in HD patients in comparison to controls. Interestingly, methylation at three of these CpG sites was inversely correlated to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. BDNF promoter methylation was not correlated with motor or cognitive scores in HD patients, and was not associated with sex or age in neither disease nor control groups. Conclusion: Our studies show that BDNF protein levels are decreased in saliva; and BDNF promoter methylation increased in blood in HD subjects when compared to controls. These findings suggest that salivary BDNF measures may represent an early marker of disease onset and DNA methylation at the BDNF promoter IV, could represent a biomarker of psychiatric symptoms in HD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lateral parabrachial nucleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, vestibular nuclei complex, and medullary viscero-sensory-motor (VSM) nuclei complex (the latter including among others the solitary nucleus, vagus nerve nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus) are anatomically and functionally connected brainstem gray matter structures that convey signals across multiple modalities between the brain and the spinal cord to regulate vital bodily functions. It is remarkably difficult to precisely extrapolate the location of these nuclei from ex vivo atlases to conventional 3 Tesla in vivo images; thus, a probabilistic brainstem template in stereotaxic neuroimaging space in living humans is needed. We delineated these nuclei using single-subject high contrast 1.1 mm isotropic resolution 7 Tesla MRI images. After precise coregistration of nuclei labels to stereotaxic space, we generated a probabilistic template of their anatomical locations. Finally, we validated the nuclei labels in the template by assessing their inter-rater agreement, consistency across subjects and volumes. We also performed a preliminary comparison of their location and microstructural properties to histologic sections of a postmortem human brainstem specimen. In future, the resulting probabilistic template of these brainstem nuclei in stereotaxic space may assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating autonomic, vestibular and VSM nuclei structure, function and connectivity in living humans using conventional 3 Tesla MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is localized in cellular organelles of most neurons, but many of its physiological functions are only partially understood. α-syn accumulation is associated with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy as well as other synucleinopathies; however, the exact pathomechanisms that underlie these neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. In this review, we describe what is known about α-syn function and pathophysiological changes in different cellular structures and organelles, including what is known about its behavior as a prion-like protein. We summarize current knowledge of α-syn and its pathological forms, covering its effect on each organelle, including aggregation and toxicity in different model systems, with special interest on the mitochondria due to its relevance during the apoptotic process of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, we explore the effect that α-syn exerts by interacting with chromatin remodeling proteins that add or remove histone marks, up-regulate its own expression, and resume the impairment that α-syn induces in vesicular traffic by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum. We then recapitulate the events that lead to Golgi apparatus fragmentation, caused by the presence of α-syn. Finally, we report the recent findings about the accumulation of α-syn, indirectly produced by the endolysosomal system. In conclusion, many important steps into the understanding of α-syn have been made using in vivo and in vitro models; however, the time is right to start integrating observational studies with mechanistic models of α-syn interactions, in order to look at a more complete picture of the pathophysiological processes underlying α-synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Virtual Reality Analgesia With Interactive Eye Tracking During Brief Thermal Pain Stimuli: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Crossover Design)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00467</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures. However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via “hands free” eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Forty eight healthy volunteers participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus, participants provided subjective 0–10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition, participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and pain unpleasantness (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger illusion of presence (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p &amp;lt; 0.001) during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Cholinergic Neuromodulation on Thalamocortical Rhythms During NREM Sleep: A Model Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00100</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00100</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that cholinergic neurons shape the oscillatory activity of the thalamocortical (TC) network in behavioral and electrophysiological experiments. However, theoretical modeling demonstrating how cholinergic neuromodulation of thalamocortical rhythms during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep might occur has been lacking. In this paper, we first develop a novel computational model (TC-ACH) by incorporating a cholinergic neuron population (CH) into the classical thalamo-cortical circuitry, where connections between populations are modeled in accordance with existing knowledge. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH) released by neurons in CH, which is able to change the discharge activity of thalamocortical neurons, is the primary focus of our work. Simulation results with our TC-ACH model reveal that the cholinergic projection activity is a key factor in modulating oscillation patterns in three ways: (1) transitions between different patterns of thalamocortical oscillations are dramatically modulated through diverse projection pathways; (2) the model expresses a stable spindle oscillation state with certain parameter settings for the cholinergic projection from CH to thalamus, and more spindles appear when the strength of cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons increases; (3) the duration of oscillation patterns during NREM sleep including K-complexes, spindles, and slow oscillations is longer when cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons becomes stronger. Our modeling results provide insights into the mechanisms by which the sleep state is controlled, and provide a theoretical basis for future experimental and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Equilibrium States and Their Stability in the Head-Direction Ring Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Head-direction cells have been found in several areas in the mammalian brains. The firing rate of an ideal head-direction cell reaches its peak value only when the animal's head points in a specific direction, and this preferred direction stays the same regardless of spatial location. In this paper we combine mathematical analytical techniques and numerical simulations to fully analyze the equilibrium states of a generic ring attractor network, which is a widely used modeling framework for the head-direction system. Under specific conditions, all solutions of the ring network are bounded, and there exists a Lyapunov function that guarantees the stability of the network for any given inputs, which may come from multiple sources in the biological system, including self-motion information for inertially based updating and landmark information for calibration. We focus on the first few terms of the Fourier series of the ring network to explicitly solve for all possible equilibrium states, followed by a stability analysis based on small perturbations. In particular, these equilibrium states include the standard single-peaked activity pattern as well as double-peaked activity pattern, whose existence is unknown but has testable experimental implications. To our surprise, we have also found an asymmetric equilibrium activity profile even when the network connectivity is strictly symmetric. Finally we examine how these different equilibrium solutions depend on the network parameters and obtain the phase diagrams in the parameter space of the ring network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Structural Neural Connectivity Analysis in Zebrafish With Restricted Anterograde Transneuronal Viral Labeling and Quantitative Brain Mapping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00085</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The unique combination of small size, translucency, and powerful genetic tools makes larval zebrafish a uniquely useful vertebrate system to investigate normal and pathological brain structure and function. While functional connectivity can now be assessed by optical imaging (via fluorescent calcium or voltage reporters) at the whole-brain scale, it remains challenging to systematically determine structural connections and identify connectivity changes during development or disease. To address this, we developed Tracer with Restricted Anterograde Spread (TRAS), a novel vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neural circuit labeling approach. TRAS makes use of replication-incompetent VSV (VSVΔG) and a helper virus (lentivirus) to enable anterograde transneuronal spread between efferent axons and their direct postsynaptic targets but restricts further spread to downstream areas. We integrated TRAS with the Z-Brain zebrafish 3D atlas for quantitative connectivity analysis and identified targets of the retinal and habenular efferent projections, in patterns consistent with previous reports. We compared retinofugal connectivity patterns between wild-type and down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like 1 (dscaml1) mutant zebrafish and revealed differences in topographical distribution. These results demonstrate the utility of TRAS for quantitative structural connectivity analysis that would be valuable for detecting novel efferent targets and mapping connectivity changes underlying neurological or behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Facilitation of Crossmodal Integration During Emotional Prediction in Methamphetamine Dependents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00080</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine (meth) can greatly damage the prefrontal cortex of the brain and trigger dysfunction of the cognitive control loop, which triggers not only drug dependence but also emotional disorders. The imbalance between the cognitive and emotional systems will lead to crossmodal emotional deficits. Until now, the negative impact of meth dependence on crossmodal emotional processing has not received attention. Therefore, the present study firstly examined the differences in crossmodal emotional processing between healthy controls and meth dependents (MADs) and then investigated the role of visual- or auditory-leading cues in the promotion of crossmodal emotional processing. Experiment 1 found that MADs made a visual–auditory integration disorder for fearful emotion, which may be related to the defects in information transmission between the auditory and auditory cortex. Experiment 2 found that MADs had a crossmodal disorder pertaining to fear under visual-leading cues, but the fearful sound improved the detection of facial emotions for MADs. Experiment 3 reconfirmed that, for MADs, A-leading cues could induce crossmodal integration immediately more easily than V-leading ones. These findings provided sufficient quantitative indicators and evidences that meth dependence was associated with crossmodal integration disorders, which in turn was associated with auditory-leading cues that enhanced the recognition ability of MADs for complex emotions (all results are available at: https://osf.io/x6rv5/). These results provided a better understanding for individuals using drugs in order to enhance the cognition for the complex crossmodal emotional integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Reserve Is Not Associated With Hippocampal Microstructure in Older Adults Without Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00380</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00380</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mean Diffusivity (MD) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging can be used to detect microstructural alterations of the brain’s gray matter (GM). A previous study found that higher education, which is a proxy for cognitive reserve (CR), was related to decreased hippocampal MD in middle-aged healthy adults, indicating decreased microstructural damage in more educated participants. Based on this study, we aimed at determining the role of hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people without dementia.
Method: We used a sample of 52 cognitively normal people and 38 participants with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) from the ADNI database. MCI and cognitively normal participants were analyzed separately. Using linear models, we regressed hippocampal GM MD on CR (quantified by a composite score), amyloid status and the interaction of both, adjusting for age, gender and memory score. 
Results: CR was not associated with hippocampal GM MD and hippocampal GM volume. Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found.
Conclusions: Our results do not confirm an association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in older adults. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between CR and microstructural, nor macrostructural alterations of the hippocampus in older adults. More research is needed to determine the influence of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity in relation to age and AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Predicting Global Cognitive Decline in the General Population Using the Disease State Index</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Identifying persons at risk for cognitive decline may aid in early detection of persons at risk of dementia and to select those that would benefit most from therapeutic or preventive measures for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;In this study we aimed to validate whether cognitive decline in the general population can be predicted with multivariate data using a previously proposed supervised classification method: Disease State Index (DSI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We included 2,542 participants, non-demented and without mild cognitive impairment at baseline, from the population-based Rotterdam Study (mean age 60.9 ± 9.1 years). Participants with significant global cognitive decline were defined as the 5% of participants with the largest cognitive decline per year. We trained DSI to predict occurrence of significant global cognitive decline using a large variety of baseline features, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, cardiovascular risk factors, APOE-ε4 allele carriership, gait features, education, and baseline cognitive function as predictors. The prediction performance was assessed as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), using 500 repetitions of 2-fold cross-validation experiments, in which (a randomly selected) half of the data was used for training and the other half for testing.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A mean AUC (95% confidence interval) for DSI prediction was 0.78 (0.77–0.79) using only age as input feature. When using all available features, a mean AUC of 0.77 (0.75–0.78) was obtained. Without age, and with age-corrected features and feature selection on MRI features, a mean AUC of 0.70 (0.63–0.76) was obtained, showing the potential of other features besides age.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The best performance in the prediction of global cognitive decline in the general population by DSI was obtained using only age as input feature. Other features showed potential, but did not improve prediction. Future studies should evaluate whether the performance could be improved by new features, e.g., longitudinal features, and other prediction methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides</title>

	<description>Stop codon readthrough (SCR) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3'UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418-induced miscoding alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and &lt;i&gt;S-&lt;/i&gt;adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: C1 neurons are part of the circuitry that recruits active expiration in response to peripheral chemoreceptors activation</title>

	<description>Breathing results from the interaction of three distinct oscillators: the pre-Bötzinger Complex (preBötC), driving inspiration, the post-inspiratory complex (PiCo), driving post-inspiration, and the lateral parafacial region (pFRG), driving active expiration. The pFRG is silent at rest and becomes rhythmically active during stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors, which also activates adrenergic C1 cells. We postulated that the C1 cells and the pFRG may constitute functionally distinct but interacting populations for controlling expiratory activity during hypoxia. We found in rats that a) C1 neurons are activated by hypoxia and project to the pFRG region; b) active expiration elicited by hypoxia was blunted after blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors at the level of the pFRG; and c) selective depletion of C1 neurons eliminated the active expiration elicited by hypoxia. These results suggest that C1 cells may regulate the respiratory cycle, including active expiration, under hypoxic conditions.</description>

	<description>In plants, clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) represents the major route for cargo internalisation from the cell surface. It has been assumed to operate in an evolutionary conserved manner as in yeast and animals. Here we report characterisation of ultrastructure, dynamics and mechanisms of plant CME as allowed by our advancement in electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging techniques. &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; CME appears to follow the constant curvature model and the &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; CME population generates vesicles of a predominantly hexagonal-basket type; larger and with faster kinetics than in other models. Contrary to the existing paradigm, actin is dispensable for CME events at the surface but plays a unique role in collecting endocytic vesicles, sorting of internalised cargos and directional endosome movement that itself actively promote CME events. Internalized vesicles display a strongly delayed and sequential uncoating. These unique features highlight the independent evolution of the plant CME mechanism during the autonomous rise of multicellularity in eukaryotes.</description>

	<description>Animals vary considerably in size, shape, and physiological features across individuals, but yet achieve remarkably similar behavioral performances. We examined how animals compensate for morphophysiological variation by measuring the system dynamics of individual knifefish (&lt;i&gt;Eigenmannia virescens&lt;/i&gt;) in a refuge tracking task. Kinematic measurements of &lt;i&gt;Eigenmannia&lt;/i&gt; were used to generate individualized estimates of each fish's locomotor plant and controller, revealing substantial variability between fish. To test the impact of this variability on behavioral performance, these models were used to perform simulated 'brain transplants'-computationally swapping controllers and plants between individuals. We found that simulated closed-loop performance was robust to mismatch between plant and controller. This suggests that animals rely on feedback rather than precisely tuned neural controllers to compensate for morphophysiological variability.</description>

	<description>Cell heterogeneity may be caused by stochastic or deterministic effects. The inheritance of regulators through cell division is a key deterministic force, but identifying inheritance effects in a systematic manner has been challenging. Here we measure and analyze cell cycles in deep lineage trees of human cancer cells and mouse embryonic stem cells and develop a statistical framework to infer underlying rules of inheritance. The observed long-range intra-generational correlations in cell-cycle duration, up to second cousins, seem paradoxical because ancestral correlations decay rapidly. However, this correlation pattern is naturally explained by the inheritance of both cell size and cell-cycle speed over several generations, provided that cell growth and division are coupled through a minimum-size checkpoint. This model correctly predicts the effects of inhibiting cell growth or cycle progression. In sum, we show how fluctuations of cell cycles across lineage trees help understand the coordination of cell growth and division.</description>

	<description>Synaptodendritic pruning is a common cause of cognitive decline in neurological disorders, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND persists in treated patients as a result of chronic inflammation and low-level expression of viral proteins, though the mechanisms involved in synaptic damage are unclear. Here, we report that the chemokine CXCL12 recoups both cognitive performance and synaptodendritic health in a rodent model of HAND, which recapitulates the neuroinflammatory state of virally controlled individuals and the associated structural/functional deficiencies. CXCL12 preferentially regulates plastic thin spines on layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex via CXCR4-dependent stimulation of the Rac1/PAK actin polymerization pathway, leading to increased spine density and improved flexible behavior. Our studies unveil a critical role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in spine dynamics and cognitive flexibility, suggesting that HAND - or other diseases driven by spine loss - may be reversible and upturned by targeting Rac1-dependent processes in cortical neurons.</description>

Most studies of area 2, a proprioceptive area of somatosensory cortex, have simply compared neurons’ activities to the movement of the hand through space. Using motion tracking, we sought to elaborate this relationship by characterizing how area 2 activity relates to whole arm movements. We found that a whole-arm model, unlike classic models, successfully predicted how features of neural activity changed as monkeys reached to targets in two workspaces. However, when we then evaluated this whole-arm model across active and passive movements, we found that many neurons did not consistently represent the whole arm over both conditions. These results suggest that 1) neural activity in area 2 includes representation of the whole arm during reaching and 2) many of these neurons represented limb state differently during active and passive movements.</description>

	<description>Visual perception of others' actions is important for social interactions, and the ability to do so, even when one gets only brief glimpses of others' behavior, may be crucial for survival. At present it is unknown how the human brain solves this problem. Imaging studies have promoted the idea that the multiple demand (MD) system, a domain general system of the human brain, operates in difficult cognitive and perceptual tasks, but not in tasks in which sensory information is reduced. Functional imaging, based on slow hemodynamic responses, may miss or standardize neural events with very diverse time courses. Here we exploited the temporal resolution of stereo-EEG to study directly cortical activity when human subjects must judge the actions of others, but only get brief glimpses of others' activity, because the videos were truncated. Multiple cortical regions increased their activity in the difficult action discrimination, relative to the easy task when the complete video was visible. The majority of these regions belonged to the MD system, being located in parietal or prefrontal cortex.  The variety of time courses, lasting from a few 100ms to several seconds, allowed us to disentangle control from effector regions, the latter processing observed actions. This distinction was further supported by relationships with behavior. A key operation within the control clusters was the prediction of erroneous responses, which was initiated in the PPC soon after the end of the truncated video. The time courses further suggested that MD regions not only exert control, but also perform various evaluations of the effort, important for efficient and intelligent behavior. We observed also increases outside the MD system, in temporo-parietal cortex, which may provide contextual information about variables related to the observed action, such as the actor, the object or the scene. Furthermore, to cope with the brief sensory input, the MD system called upon warning regions reacting to the static picture of the actor presented just before the video. We conclude that discrimination of brief observed actions indeed involves the MD system, which is thus is more general than assumed so far. WE also show that the MD system is more complex than assumed, as it includes evaluation of control, and more flexible, as it interacts with other systems than simply the effector circuit of the task.</description>

	<description>Ventral visual cortex can be divided into a variety of retinotopically as well as category-specific regions. These brain areas have been the focus of a large body of functional MRI research, significantly expanding our understanding of high-level visual processing. As studying these regions requires accurate localization of their cortical location, it is usually necessary to perform functional localizer runs on an individual subject level. These runs are costly in terms of scanning time and a participant's capacity level. Moreover, certain patient populations are unable to undergo such localizers, for instance the congenitally blind. In the current paper, we aimed to overcome these challenges by developing a functional atlas based on localizer- and visual field mapping data acquired in 20 healthy subjects. Single subject functional maps were aligned to both volume and surface group space, after which a probabilistic functional group atlas was created. We subsequently quantified the inter-subject variability of category-selective regions in visual cortex and the specificity of each atlas region - to our knowledge the first such analyses. Additionally, we validated our atlas against existing atlases of retinotopic as well as category-specific regions. The resulting functional atlas is made publicly available for a variety of software packages (https://share.brainvoyager.com/index.php/s/m2E9oZTGWwXodRk).</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Tissue-guided LASSO for prediction of clinical drug response using preclinical samples</title>

Prediction of clinical drug response (CDR) of cancer patients, based on their clinical and molecular profiles obtained prior to administration of the drug, can play a significant role in individualized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to address this issue but training them requires data from a large number of patients treated with each drug, limiting their feasibility. While large databases of drug response and molecular profiles of preclinical &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; cancer cell lines (CCLs) exist for many drugs, it is unclear whether preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of real patients. We designed a systematic approach to evaluate how well different algorithms, trained on gene expression and drug response of CCLs, can predict CDR of patients. Using data from two large databases, we evaluated various linear and non-linear algorithms, some of which utilized information on gene interactions. Then, we developed a new algorithm called TG-LASSO that explicitly integrates information on samples’ tissue of origin with gene expression profiles to improve prediction performance. Our results showed that regularized regression methods provide better prediction performance. However, including the network information or common methods of including information on the tissue of origin did not improve the results. On the other hand, TG-LASSO improved the predictions and distinguished resistant and sensitive patients for 7 out of 13 drugs. Additionally, TG-LASSO identified genes associated with the drug response, including known targets and pathways involved in the drugs’ mechanism of action. Moreover, genes identified by TG-LASSO for multiple drugs in a tissue were associated with patient survival. In summary, our analysis suggests that preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of patients and identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and survival.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rAZBxYSJIMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Intravenous Immunomodulatory Nanoparticle Treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no definitive disease‐modifying therapies for traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we present a strong therapeutic candidate for TBI, immunomodulatory nanoparticles (IMPs), which ablate a specific subset of hematogenous monocytes (hMos). We hypothesized that prevention of infiltration of these cells into brain acutely after TBI would attenuate secondary damage and preserve anatomic and neurologic function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPs, composed of US Food and Drug Administration–approved 500nm carboxylated‐poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic) acid, were infused intravenously into wild‐type C57BL/6 mice following 2 different models of experimental TBI, controlled cortical impact (CCI), and closed head injury (CHI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMP administration resulted in remarkable preservation of both tissue and neurological function in both CCI and CHI TBI models in mice. After acute treatment, there was a reduction in the number of immune cells infiltrating into the brain, mitigation of the inflammatory status of the infiltrating cells, improved electrophysiologic visual function, improved long‐term motor behavior, reduced edema formation as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and reduced lesion volumes on anatomic examination.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that IMPs are a clinically translatable acute intervention for TBI with a well‐defined mechanism of action and beneficial anatomic and physiologic preservation and recovery. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A Novel Recessive TNNT1 Congenital Core‐Rod Myopathy in French Canadians</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25685?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25685?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recessive null variants of the slow skeletal muscle troponin T1 (&lt;i&gt;TNNT1&lt;/i&gt;) gene are a rare cause of nemaline myopathy that is fatal in infancy due to respiratory insufficiency. Muscle biopsy shows rods and fiber type disproportion. We report on four French Canadians with a novel form of recessive congenital &lt;i&gt;TNNT1&lt;/i&gt; core‐rod myopathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients underwent full clinical characterization, lower limb MRI, muscle biopsy and genetic testing. A zebrafish loss‐of‐function model using morpholinos was created to assess the pathogenicity of the identified variant. Wild type or mutated human &lt;i&gt;TNNT1&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs were co‐injected with morpholinos to assess their abilities to rescue the morphant phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three adults and one child shared a novel missense homozygous variant in the &lt;i&gt;TNNT1&lt;/i&gt; gene (c.287T&amp;gt;C; p.Leu96Pro). They developed from childhood very slowly progressive limb‐girdle weakness with rigid spine and disabling contractures. They suffered from restrictive lung disease requiring non‐invasive mechanical ventilation in three patients, as well as recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections, which were relieved by dantrolene in one patient. Older patients remained ambulatory into their sixties. MRI of the leg muscles showed fibro‐fatty infiltration predominating in the posterior thigh and the deep posterior leg compartments. Muscle biopsies showed multi‐minicores and lobulated fibers, rods in half the patients and no fiber type disproportion. Wild type &lt;i&gt;TNNT1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA rescued the zebrafish morphants but mutant transcripts failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study expands the phenotypic spectrum of &lt;i&gt;TNNT1&lt;/i&gt; myopathy and provides functional evidence for the pathogenicity of the newly identified missense mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate β‐amyloid and tau depositions using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET and AV1451 tau PET imaging in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS (n=16) and controls (n=80) matched for age, sex and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AD‐signature PiB SUVr (OR(95%CI)=0.52(0.27,0.98),p=0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR(95%CI)=0.52(0.28,0.99),p=0.048) and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR(95%CI)=0.10(0.01,0.90),p=0.040) were lower in MS than controls. While AD‐signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR(95%CI)=10.65(1.10,103.35),p=0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD‐signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate(95%CI))=‐0.14(‐0.023,‐0.006),p=0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate(95%CI))=‐0.13(‐0.021,‐0.005),p=0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both β‐amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical β‐amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age‐matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of β‐amyloid, but not the accumulation of tau.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NURR1 and ERR1 Modulate the Expression of Genes of a DRD2 Coexpression Network Enriched for Schizophrenia Risk</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/932?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple schizophrenia (SCZ) risk loci may be involved in gene co-regulation mechanisms, and analysis of coexpressed gene networks may help to clarify SCZ molecular basis. We have previously identified a dopamine D2 receptor (&lt;i&gt;DRD2&lt;/i&gt;) coexpression module enriched for SCZ risk genes and associated with cognitive and neuroimaging phenotypes of SCZ, as well as with response to treatment with antipsychotics. Here we aimed to identify regulatory factors modulating this coexpression module and their relevance to SCZ. We performed motif enrichment analysis to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites in human promoters of genes coexpressed with &lt;i&gt;DRD2.&lt;/i&gt; Then, we measured transcript levels of a group of these genes in primary mouse cortical neurons in basal conditions and upon overexpression and knockdown of predicted TFs. Finally, we analyzed expression levels of these TFs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ patients. Our &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis revealed enrichment for NURR1 and ERR1 binding sites. In neuronal cultures, the expression of genes either relevant to SCZ risk (&lt;i&gt;Drd2, Gatad2a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Slc28a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;/i&gt;) or indexing coexpression in our module (&lt;i&gt;Btg4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chit1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Osr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gpld1&lt;/i&gt;) was significantly modified by gain and loss of Nurr1 and Err1. Postmortem DLPFC expression data analysis showed decreased expression levels of NURR1 and ERR1 in patients with SCZ. For NURR1 such decreased expression is associated with treatment with antipsychotics. Our results show that NURR1 and ERR1 modulate the transcription of &lt;i&gt;DRD2&lt;/i&gt; coexpression partners and support the hypothesis that NURR1 is involved in the response to SCZ treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we provide &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and experimental evidence for a role of the TFs NURR1 and ERR1 in modulating the expression pattern of genes coexpressed with &lt;i&gt;DRD2&lt;/i&gt; in human DLPFC. Notably, genetic variations in these genes is associated with SCZ risk and behavioral and neuroimaging phenotypes of the disease, as well as with response to treatment. Furthermore, this study presents novel findings on a possible interplay between D2 receptor-mediated dopamine signaling involved in treatment with antipsychotics and the transcriptional regulation mechanisms exerted by NURR1. Our results suggest that coexpression and co-regulation mechanisms may help to explain some of the complex biology of genetic associations with SCZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Categorization allows organisms to generalize existing knowledge to novel stimuli and to discriminate between physically similar yet conceptually different stimuli. Humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents can readily learn arbitrary categories defined by low-level visual features, and learning distorts perceptual sensitivity for category-defining features such that differences between physically similar yet categorically distinct exemplars are enhanced, whereas differences between equally similar but categorically identical stimuli are reduced. We report a possible basis for these distortions in human occipitoparietal cortex. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivoxel and multielectrode patterns of human brain activity while human participants (both sexes) classified continuous stimulus sets into discrete groups. In each experiment, reconstructed representations of to-be-categorized stimuli were systematically biased toward the center of the appropriate category. These biases were largest for exemplars near a category boundary, predicted participants' overt category judgments, emerged shortly after stimulus onset, and could not be explained by mechanisms of response selection or motor preparation. Collectively, our findings suggest that category learning can influence processing at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Category learning enhances perceptual sensitivity for physically similar yet categorically different stimuli. We report a possible mechanism for these changes in human occipitoparietal cortex. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivariate patterns in occipitoparietal cortex while participants categorized sets of continuous stimuli into discrete groups. The recovered representations were systematically biased by category membership, with larger biases for exemplars adjacent to a category boundary. These results suggest that mechanisms of categorization shape information processing at the earliest stages of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Locus Coeruleus Norepinephrine Drives Stress-Induced Increases in Basolateral Amygdala Firing and Impairs Extinction Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/907?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/907?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stress impairs extinction learning, and these deficits depend, in part, on stress-induced norepinephrine (NE) release in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). For example, systemic or intra-BLA administration of propranolol reduces the immediate extinction deficit (IED), an impairment in extinction learning that occurs when extinction trials are administered soon after fear conditioning. Here, we explored whether locus coeruleus (LC)-NE regulates stress-induced changes in spike firing in the BLA and consequent extinction learning impairments. Rats were implanted with recording arrays in the BLA and, after recovery from surgery, underwent a standard auditory fear conditioning procedure. Fear conditioning produced an immediate and dramatic increase in the spontaneous firing of BLA neurons that persisted (and in some units, increased further) up to an hour after conditioning. This stress-induced increase in BLA firing was prevented by systemic administration of propranolol. Conditioning with a weaker footshock caused smaller increases in BLA firing rate, but this could be augmented by chemogenetic activation of the LC. Conditioned freezing in response to a tone paired with a weak footshock was immune to the IED, but chemogenetic activation of the LC before the weak conditioning protocol increased conditioned freezing behavior and induced an IED; this effect was blocked with intra-BLA infusions of propranolol. These data suggest that stress-induced activation of the LC increases BLA spike firing and causes impairments in extinction learning. Stress-induced increases in BLA activity mediated by LC-NE may be a viable therapeutic target for individuals with stress- and trauma-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show heightened amygdala activity; elevated levels of stress hormones, including norepinephrine; and are resistant to the extinction of fear memories. Here, we show that stress increases basolateral amygdala (BLA) spike firing. This could be attenuated by systemic propranolol and mimicked by chemogenetic activation of the locus coeruleus (LC), the source of forebrain norepinephrine (NE). Finally, we show that LC-NE activation is sufficient to produce extinction deficits, and this is blocked by intra-BLA propranolol. Stress-induced increases in BLA activity mediated by LC-NE may be a viable therapeutic target for individuals with PTSD and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Connectivity between the Cerebellum and Somatosensory Areas Implements the Attenuation of Self-Generated Touch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/894?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/894?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense and less ticklish than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with fMRI to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When we touch our hand with the other, the resulting sensation feels less intense than when another person or a machine touches our hand with the same intensity. Early computational motor control theories have proposed that the cerebellum predicts and cancels the sensory consequences of our movements; however, the neural correlates of this cancelation remain unknown. By means of fMRI, we show that the more participants attenuate the perception of their self-generated touch, the stronger the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortical areas. This provides conclusive evidence about the role of the cerebellum in predicting the sensory feedback of our movements and in attenuating the associated percepts via its connections to early somatosensory areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Complementary Roles for Ventral Pallidum Cell Types and Their Projections in Relapse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/880?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/880?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key node in the neural circuits controlling relapse to drug seeking. How this role relates to different VP cell types and their projections is poorly understood. Using male rats, we show how different forms of relapse to alcohol-seeking are assembled from VP cell types and their projections to lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using RNAScope &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to characterize activity of different VP cell types during relapse to alcohol-seeking provoked by renewal (context-induced reinstatement), we found that VP Gad1 and parvalbumin (PV), but not vGlut2, neurons show relapse-associated changes in c-Fos expression. Next, we used retrograde tracing, chemogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to study the roles of VP&lt;sup&gt;Gad1&lt;/sup&gt; and VP&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in relapse. We show that VP&lt;sup&gt;Gad1&lt;/sup&gt; neurons contribute to contextual control over relapse (renewal), but not to relapse during reacquisition, via projections to LH, where they converge with ventral striatal inputs onto LH&lt;sup&gt;Gad1&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. This convergence of striatopallidal inputs at the level of individual LH&lt;sup&gt;Gad1&lt;/sup&gt; neurons may be critical to balancing propensity for relapse versus abstinence. In contrast, VP&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; neurons contribute to relapse during both renewal and reacquisition via projections to VTA. These findings identify a double dissociation in the roles for different VP cell types and their projections in relapse. VP&lt;sup&gt;Gad1&lt;/sup&gt; neurons control relapse during renewal via projections to LH. VP&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; neurons control relapse during both renewal and reacquisition via projections to VTA. Targeting these different pathways may provide tailored interventions for different forms of relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Relapse to drug or reward seeking after a period of extinction or abstinence remains a key impediment to successful treatment. The ventral pallidum, located in the ventral basal ganglia, has long been recognized as an obligatory node in a 'final common pathway' for relapse. Yet how this role relates to the considerable VP cellular and circuit heterogeneity is not well understood. We studied the cellular and circuit architecture for VP in relapse control. We show that different forms of relapse have complementary VP cellular and circuit architectures, raising the possibility that targeting these different neural architectures may provide tailored interventions for different forms of relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Predicting the Partition of Behavioral Variability in Speed Perception with Naturalistic Stimuli</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A core goal of visual neuroscience is to predict human perceptual performance from natural signals. Performance in any natural task can be limited by at least three sources of uncertainty: stimulus variability, internal noise, and suboptimal computations. Determining the relative importance of these factors has been a focus of interest for decades but requires methods for predicting the fundamental limits imposed by stimulus variability on sensory-perceptual precision. Most successes have been limited to simple stimuli and simple tasks. But perception science ultimately aims to understand how vision works with natural stimuli. Successes in this domain have proven elusive. Here, we develop a model of humans based on an image-computable (images in, estimates out) Bayesian ideal observer. Given biological constraints, the ideal optimally uses the statistics relating local intensity patterns in moving images to speed, specifying the fundamental limits imposed by natural stimuli. Next, we propose a theoretical link between two key decision-theoretic quantities that suggests how to experimentally disentangle the impacts of internal noise and deterministic suboptimal computations. In several interlocking discrimination experiments with three male observers, we confirm this link and determine the quantitative impact of each candidate performance-limiting factor. Human performance is near-exclusively limited by natural stimulus variability and internal noise, and humans use near-optimal computations to estimate speed from naturalistic image movies. The findings indicate that the partition of behavioral variability can be predicted from a principled analysis of natural images and scenes. The approach should be extendable to studies of neural variability with natural signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accurate estimation of speed is critical for determining motion in the environment, but humans cannot perform this task without error. Different objects moving at the same speed cast different images on the eyes. This stimulus variability imposes fundamental external limits on the human ability to estimate speed. Predicting these limits has proven difficult. Here, by analyzing natural signals, we predict the quantitative impact of natural stimulus variability on human performance given biological constraints. With integrated experiments, we compare its impact to well-studied performance-limiting factors internal to the visual system. The results suggest that the deterministic computations humans perform are near optimal, and that behavioral responses to natural stimuli can be studied with the rigor and interpretability defining work with simpler stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Representation of Two-Body Shapes in the Human Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human social nature has shaped visual perception. A signature of the relationship between vision and sociality is a particular visual sensitivity to social entities such as faces and bodies. We asked whether human vision also exhibits a special sensitivity to spatial relations that reliably correlate with social relations. In general, interacting people are more often situated face-to-face than back-to-back. Using functional MRI and behavioral measures in female and male human participants, we show that visual sensitivity to social stimuli extends to images including two bodies facing toward (vs away from) each other. In particular, the inferior lateral occipital cortex, which is involved in visual-object perception, is organized such that the inferior portion encodes the number of bodies (one vs two) and the superior portion is selectively sensitive to the spatial relation between bodies (facing vs nonfacing). Moreover, functionally localized, body-selective visual cortex responded to facing bodies more strongly than identical, but nonfacing, bodies. In this area, multivariate pattern analysis revealed an accurate representation of body dyads with sharpening of the representation of single-body postures in facing dyads, which demonstrates an effect of visual context on the perceptual analysis of a body. Finally, the cost of body inversion (upside-down rotation) on body recognition, a behavioral signature of a specialized mechanism for body perception, was larger for facing versus nonfacing dyads. Thus, spatial relations between multiple bodies are encoded in regions for body perception and affect the way in which bodies are processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human social nature has shaped visual perception. Here, we show that human vision is not only attuned to socially relevant entities, such as bodies, but also to socially relevant spatial relations between those entities. Body-selective regions of visual cortex respond more strongly to multiple bodies that appear to be interacting (i.e., face-to-face), relative to unrelated bodies, and more accurately represent single body postures in interacting scenarios. Moreover, recognition of facing bodies is particularly susceptible to perturbation by upside-down rotation, indicative of a particular visual sensitivity to the canonical appearance of facing bodies. This encoding of relations between multiple bodies in areas for body-shape recognition suggests that the visual context in which a body is encountered deeply affects its perceptual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pattern Separation and Source Memory Engage Distinct Hippocampal and Neocortical Regions during Retrieval</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/843?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/843?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Detailed representations of past events rely on the ability to form associations between items and their contextual features (i.e., source memory), as well as the ability to distinctly represent a new event from a similar one stored in memory (i.e., pattern separation). These processes are both known to engage the hippocampus, although whether they share similar mechanisms remains unclear. It is also unknown if, and in which region(s), activity related to these processes overlaps and/or interacts. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to examine the contributions of hippocampal subfields and neocortical areas to pattern separation and source memory with an experimental paradigm that concurrently tested both. During encoding, male and female human subjects incidentally studied items in one of four quadrants on the screen. During test, they viewed repeated items (targets), similar items (lures), and new items (foils) and were asked to indicate whether each item was old, similar, or new. Following each item judgment, subjects were asked to indicate the quadrant in which the original stimulus was presented. Thus, each lure trial had a lure discrimination component (taxing pattern separation) and a location judgment (source memory). We found two main response profiles: (1) pattern separation-related signals in DG/CA3 and perirhinal cortex and (2) source memory signals in posterior CA1, parahippocampal cortex, and angular gyrus. Whole-brain voxelwise analysis revealed that activity related to lure discrimination and source memory was largely nonoverlapping. These findings suggest that distinct processes underlie the retrieval of pattern separated item representations and recollection of source information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recalling past events with detail and accuracy depends on the ability to remember the contextual features of an event (i.e., source memory) as well as the ability to distinguish among similar events in memory (i.e., pattern separation). Previous work has shown that these processes are behaviorally dissociable (e.g., people can have clear memory for context but misidentify people or items). However, both processes engage the hippocampus, and it is unclear whether they rely on shared or distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to concurrently assess hippocampal and neocortical activity related to source memory and pattern separation. We found that activity related to these processes was largely nonoverlapping, shedding light on two complementary but distinct mechanisms supporting episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PSA-NCAM Colocalized with Cholecystokinin-Expressing Cells in the Hippocampus Is Involved in Mediating Antidepressant Efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/825?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extracellular glycan polysialic acid linked to neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is principally expressed in the developing brain and the adult neurogenic regions. Although colocalization of PSA-NCAM with cholecystokinin (CCK) was found in the adult brain, the role of PSA-NCAM remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the functional significance of PSA-NCAM in the CA1 region of the male mouse hippocampus. Combined fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that few vesicular glutamate transporter 3-negative/CCK-positive (VGluT3&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) cells were colocalized with PSA-NCAM, but most of the VGluT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were colocalized with PSA-NCAM. The somata of PSA-NCAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were highly innervated by serotonergic boutons than those of PSA-NCAM&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. The expression ratios of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and p11, a serotonin receptor-interacting protein, were higher in PSA-NCAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells than in PSA-NCAM&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Pharmacological digestion of PSA-NCAM impaired the efficacy of antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but not the efficacy of benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam. A Western blot showed that restraint stress decreased the expressions of p11 and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and FLX increased them. Interestingly, the FLX-induced elevation of expression of p11, but not mature BDNF, was impaired by the digestion of PSA-NCAM. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that restraint stress reduced the expression of polysialyltransferase ST8Sia IV and FLX elevated it. Collectively, PSA-NCAM colocalized with VGluT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus may play a unique role in the regulation of antidepressant efficacy via the serotonergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Polysialic acid (PSA) is composed of eight or more α2,8-linked sialic acids. Here, we examined the functional significance of polysialic acid linked to the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in the adult mouse hippocampus. Few vesicular glutamate transporter 3-negative/cholecystokinin-positive (VGluT3&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) cells were colocalized with PSA-NCAM, but most of the VGluT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were colocalized with PSA-NCAM. The expression ratios of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and p11, a serotonin receptor-interacting protein, were higher in PSA-NCAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells than in PSA-NCAM&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. The efficacy of antidepressants, but not anxiolytics, was impaired by the digestion of PSA-NCAM. The antidepressant-induced increase in p11 expression was inhibited following PSA-NCAM digestion. We hence hypothesize that PSA-NCAM colocalized with VGluT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells may play a unique role in regulating antidepressant efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Stimulation Augments Spike Sequence Replay and Memory Consolidation during Slow-Wave Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/811?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/811?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Newly acquired memory traces are spontaneously reactivated during slow-wave sleep (SWS), leading to the consolidation of recent memories. Empirical studies found that sensory stimulation during SWS can selectively enhance memory consolidation with the effect depending on the phase of stimulation. In this new study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms behind the role of sensory stimulation on memory consolidation using computational models implementing effects of neuromodulators to simulate transitions between awake and SWS sleep, and synaptic plasticity to allow the change of synaptic connections due to the training in awake or replay during sleep. We found that when closed-loop stimulation was applied during the Down states of sleep slow oscillation, particularly right before the transition from Down to Up state, it significantly affected the spatiotemporal pattern of the slow waves and maximized memory replay. In contrast, when the stimulation was presented during the Up states, it did not have a significant impact on the slow waves or memory performance after sleep. For multiple memories trained in awake, presenting stimulation cues associated with specific memory trace could selectively augment replay and enhance consolidation of that memory and interfere with consolidation of the others (particularly weak) memories. Our study proposes a synaptic-level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stimulation, such as training-associated cues or auditory stimulation, during sleep can augment consolidation of the newly encoded memories. In this study, we used a computational model of the thalamocortical system to describe the mechanisms behind the role of stimulation in memory consolidation during slow-wave sleep. Our study suggests that stimulation preferentially strengthens memory traces when delivered at a specific phase of the slow oscillation, just before the Down to Up state transition when it makes the largest impact on the spatiotemporal pattern of sleep slow waves. In the presence of multiple memories, presenting sensory cues during sleep could selectively strengthen selected memories. Our study proposes a synaptic-level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rod Photoreceptors Signal Fast Changes in Daylight Levels Using a Cx36-Independent Retinal Pathway in Mouse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/796?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/796?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal contrast detected by rod photoreceptors is channeled into multiple retinal rod pathways that ultimately connect to cone photoreceptor pathways via Cx36 gap junctions or via chemical synapses. However, we do not yet understand how the different rod pathways contribute to the perception of temporal contrast (changes in luminance with time) at mesopic light levels, where both rods and cones actively respond to light. Here, we use a forced-choice, operant behavior assay to investigate rod-driven, temporal contrast sensitivity (TCS) in mice of either sex. Transgenic mice with desensitized cones (GNAT2&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cpfl3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; line) were used to identify rod contributions to TCS in mesopic lights. We found that at low mesopic lights (400 photons/s/μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the retina), control and GNAT2&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cpfl3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice had similar TCS. Surprisingly, at upper mesopic lights (8000 photons/s/μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), GNAT2&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cpfl3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice exhibited a relative reduction in TCS to low (&amp;lt;12 Hz) while maintaining normal TCS to high (12–36 Hz) temporal frequencies. The rod-driven responses to high temporal frequencies developed gradually over time (&amp;gt;30 min). Furthermore, the TCS of GNAT2&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cpfl3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and GNAT2&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;cpfl3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;::Cx36&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice matched closely, indicating that transmission of high-frequency signals (1) does not require the rod-cone Cx36 gap junctions as has been proposed in the past; and (2) a Cx36-independent rod pathway(s) (e.g., direct rod to OFF cone bipolar cell synapses and/or glycinergic synapses from AII amacrine cells to OFF ganglion cells) is sufficient for fast, mesopic rod-driven vision. These findings extend our understanding of the link between visual circuits and perception in mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The contributions of specific retinal pathways to visual perception are not well understood. We found that the temporal processing properties of rod-driven vision in mice change significantly with light level. In dim lights, rods relay relatively slow temporal variations. However, in daylight conditions, rod pathways exhibit high sensitivity to fast but not to slow temporal variations, whereas cone-driven responses supplement the loss in rod-driven sensitivity to slow temporal variations. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay of rod- and cone-driven vision as light levels rise from night to daytime levels. Furthermore, the fast, rod-driven signals do not require the rod-to-cone Cx36 gap junctions as proposed in the past, but rather, can be relayed by alternative Cx36-independent rod pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Convergence between Microglia and Peripheral Macrophages Phenotype during Development and Neuroinflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/784?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Differently from other myeloid cells, microglia derive exclusively from precursors originating within the yolk sac and migrate to the CNS under development, without any contribution from fetal liver or postnatal hematopoiesis. Consistent with their unique ontology, microglia may express specific physiological markers, which have been partly described in recent years. Here we wondered whether profiles distinguishing microglia from peripheral macrophages vary with age and under pathology. To this goal, we profiled transcriptomes of microglia throughout the lifespan and included a parallel comparison with peripheral macrophages under physiological and neuroinflammatory settings using age- and sex-matched wild-type and bone marrow chimera mouse models. This comprehensive approach demonstrated that the phenotypic differentiation between microglia and peripheral macrophages is age-dependent and that peripheral macrophages do express some of the most commonly described microglia-specific markers early during development, such as Fcrls, P2ry12, Tmem119, and Trem2. Further, during chronic neuroinflammation CNS-infiltrating macrophages and not peripheral myeloid cells acquire microglial markers, indicating that the CNS niche may instruct peripheral myeloid cells to gain the phenotype and, presumably, the function of the microglia cell. In conclusion, our data provide further evidence about the plasticity of the myeloid cell and suggest caution in the strict definition and application of microglia-specific markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the respective role of microglia and infiltrating monocytes in neuroinflammatory conditions has recently seemed possible by the identification of a specific microglia signature. Here instead we provide evidence that peripheral macrophages may express some of the most commonly described microglia markers at some developmental stages or pathological conditions, in particular during chronic neuroinflammation. Further, our data support the hypothesis about phenotypic plasticity and convergence among distinct myeloid cells so that they may act as a functional unit rather than as different entities, boosting their mutual functions in different phases of disease. This holds relevant implications in the view of the growing use of myeloid cell therapies to treat brain disease in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ocular Dominance Plasticity in Binocular Primary Visual Cortex Does Not Require C1q</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/769?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/4/769?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;C1q, the initiator of the classical complement cascade, mediates synapse elimination in the postnatal mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and sensorimotor cortex. Here, we asked whether C1q plays a role in experience-dependent synaptic refinement in the visual system at later stages of development. The binocular zone of primary visual cortex (V1b) undergoes spine loss and changes in neuronal responsiveness following the closure of one eye during a defined critical period [a process referred to as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP)]. We therefore hypothesized that ODP would be impaired in the absence of C1q, and that V1b development would also be abnormal without C1q-mediated synapse elimination. However, when we examined several features of V1b development in mice lacking C1q, we found that the densities of most spine populations on basal and proximal apical dendrites, as well as firing rates and ocular dominance, were normal. C1q was only transiently required for the development of spines on apical, but not basal, secondary dendrites. Dendritic morphologies were also unaffected. Although we did not observe the previously described spine loss during ODP in either genotype, our results reveal that the animals lacking C1q had normal shifts in neuronal responsiveness following eye closure. Experiments were performed in both male and female mice. These results suggest that the development and plasticity of the mouse V1b is grossly normal in the absence of C1q.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; These findings illustrate that the development and experience-dependent plasticity of V1b is mostly normal in the absence of C1q, even though C1q has previously been shown to be required for developmental synapse elimination in the mouse visual thalamus as well as sensorimotor cortex. The V1b phenotypes in mice lacking C1q are more similar to the mild defects previously observed in the hippocampus of these mice, emphasizing that the contribution of C1q to synapse elimination appears to be dependent on context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Npas1+-Nkx2.1+ Neurons Are an Integral Part of the Cortico-pallido-cortical Loop</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the basal ganglia circuit, the external globus pallidus (GPe) is critically involved in motor control. Aside from Foxp2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and ChAT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons that have been established as unique neuron types, there is little consensus on the classification of GPe neurons. Properties of the remaining neuron types are poorly defined. In this study, we leverage new mouse lines, viral tools, and molecular markers to better define GPe neuron subtypes. We found that Sox6 represents a novel, defining marker for GPe neuron subtypes. Lhx6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons that lack the expression of Sox6 were devoid of both parvalbumin and Npas1. This result confirms previous assertions of the existence of a unique Lhx6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population. Neurons that arise from the Dbx1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lineage were similarly abundant in the GPe and displayed a heterogeneous makeup. Importantly, tracing experiments revealed that Npas1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons represent the principal noncholinergic, cortically-projecting neurons. In other words, they form the pallido-cortical arm of the cortico-pallido-cortical loop. Our data further show that pyramidal-tract neurons in the cortex collateralized within the GPe, forming a closed-loop system between the two brain structures. Overall, our findings reconcile some of the discrepancies that arose from differences in techniques or the reliance on preexisting tools. Although spatial distribution and electrophysiological properties of GPe neurons reaffirm the diversification of GPe subtypes, statistical analyses strongly support the notion that these neuron subtypes can be categorized under the two principal neuron classes: PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and Npas1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The poor understanding of the neuronal composition in the external globus pallidus (GPe) undermines our ability to interrogate its precise behavioral and disease involvements. In this study, 12 different genetic crosses were used, hundreds of neurons were electrophysiologically characterized, and &amp;gt;100,000 neurons were histologically- and/or anatomically-profiled. Our current study further establishes the segregation of GPe neuron classes and illustrates the complexity of GPe neurons in adult mice. Our results support the idea that Npas1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;–Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are a distinct GPe neuron subclass. By providing a detailed analysis of the organization of the cortico-pallidal-cortical projection, our findings establish the cellular and circuit substrates that can be important for motor function and dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The impact of pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels on synaptic transmission is poorly understood. Here, we show that selective block of Panx1 in single postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons from male rat or mouse brain slices causes intermittent, seconds long increases in the frequency of sEPSC following Schaffer collateral stimulation. The increase in sEPSC frequency occurred without an effect on evoked neurotransmission. Consistent with a presynaptic origin of the augmented glutamate release, the increased sEPSC frequency was prevented by bath-applied EGTA-AM or TTX. Manipulation of a previously described metabotropic NMDAR pathway (i.e., by preventing ligand binding to NMDARs with competitive antagonists or blocking downstream Src kinase) also increased sEPSC frequency similar to that seen when Panx1 was blocked. This facilitated glutamate release was absent in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) KO mice and prevented by the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine, suggesting it required presynaptic TRPV1. We show presynaptic expression of TRPV1 by immunoelectron microscopy and link TRPV1 to Panx1 because Panx1 block increases tissue levels of the endovanilloid, anandamide. Together, these findings demonstrate an unexpected role for metabotropic NMDARs and postsynaptic Panx1 in suppression of facilitated glutamate neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The postsynaptic ion and metabolite channel, pannexin-1, is regulated by metabotropic NMDAR signaling through Src kinase. This pathway suppresses facilitated release of presynaptic glutamate during synaptic activity by regulating tissue levels of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 agonist anandamide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ACh is a signaling molecule in the mammalian CNS, with well-documented influence over cognition and behavior. However, the nature of cholinergic signaling in the brain remains controversial, with ongoing debates focused on the spatial and temporal resolution of ACh activity. Generally, opposing views have embraced a dichotomy between transmission as slow and volume-mediated versus fast and synaptic. Here, we provide the perspective that ACh, like most other neurotransmitters, exhibits both fast and slow modes that are strongly determined by the anatomy of cholinergic fibers, the distribution and the signaling mechanisms of receptor subtypes, and the dynamics of ACh hydrolysis. Current methodological approaches remain limited in their ability to provide detailed analyses of these underlying factors. However, we believe that the continued development of novel technologies in combination with a more nuanced view of cholinergic activity will open critical new avenues to a better understanding of ACh in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conceptualizations of cholinergic signaling as primarily spatially diffuse and slow-acting are based largely on measures of extracellular brain ACh levels that require several minutes to generate a single data point. In addition, most such studies inhibited the highly potent catalytic enzyme for ACh, AChE, to facilitate measurement of ACh. Absent such inhibition, AChE limits the presence of ambient ACh and thus renders it unlikely that ACh influences target regions via slow changes in extracellular ACh concentrations. We describe an alternative view by which forebrain signaling in cortex driving cognition is largely phasic (milliseconds to perhaps seconds), and unlikely to be volume-transmitted. This alternative is supported by new evidence from real-time amperometric recordings of cholinergic signaling indicating a specific function of rapid, phasic, transient cholinergic signaling in attentional contexts. Previous neurochemical evidence may be reinterpreted in terms of integrated phasic cholinergic activity that mediates specific behavioral and cognitive operations; this reinterpretation fits well with recent computational models. Optogenetic studies support a causal relationship between cholinergic transients and behavior. This occurs in part via transient-evoked muscarinic receptor-mediated high-frequency oscillations in cortical regions. Such oscillations outlast cholinergic transients and thus link transient ACh signaling with more sustained postsynaptic activity patterns to support relatively persistent attentional biases. Reconceptualizing cholinergic function as spatially specific, phasic, and modulating specific cognitive operations is theoretically powerful and may lead to pharmacologic treatments more effective than those based on traditional views.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Retinoic Acid Is Required for Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Production and Differentiation in the Postnatal Mouse Corpus Callosum</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Myelination of the CNS relies on the production and differentiation of oligodendrocyte (OL) precursor cells (OPCs) into mature OLs. During the first month of postnatal life, OPCs that populate the corpus callosum (CC) arise from neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subcallosal subventricular zone (SVZ), and then differentiate to generate myelinating OLs. However, the signals that regulate these processes are not fully understood. In this study, we show that endogenous expression of the retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) is required for OPC generation and differentiation in the postnatal subcortical white matter. In male and female pups, conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Raldh2&lt;/i&gt; reduced OPC numbers and differentiation. Moreover, decreased OPC numbers coincided with reductions in NSC survival and expression of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling effector protein &lt;i&gt;Gli1&lt;/i&gt; in the SVZ. Additionally, GFAP expression in the CC was decreased, and cortical neuron numbers were altered. Our work suggests a role for endogenous RALDH2-dependent RA synthesis in OPC production and differentiation in the CC, as well as in the development of other cell types derived from NSCs in the embryonic ventricular zone (VZ) and SVZ, as well as the postnatal subcallosal SVZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Preservation of partially mixed selectivity in human posterior parietal cortex across changes in task context</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Recent studies in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have found multiple effectors and cognitive strategies represented within a shared neural substrate in a structure termed &quot;partially mixed selectivity&quot; (Zhang et al., 2017). In this study, we examine whether the structure of these representations are preserved across changes in task context and is thus a robust and generalizable property of the neural population. Specifically, we test whether the structure is conserved from an open-loop motor imagery task (training) to a closed-loop cortical control task (online), a change that has led to substantial changes in neural behavior in prior studies in motor cortex. Recording from a 4x4 mm electrode array implanted in PPC of a human tetraplegic patient participating in a brain-machine interface (BMI) clinical trial, we studied the representations of imagined/attempted movements of the left/right hand and compare their individual BMI control performance using a one dimensional cursor control task. We found that the structure of the representations is largely maintained between training and online control. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the structure observed in the context of an open-loop motor imagery task is maintained and accessible in the context of closed-loop BMI control. These results indicate that it is possible to decode the mixed variables found from a small patch of cortex in PPC and use them individually for BMI control. Furthermore, they show that the structure of the mixed representations is maintained and robust across changes in task context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple effectors and cognitive strategies are represented within a small patch of human posterior parietal cortex (Zhang et al., 2017). However, it is unknown to what degree the structure of the representations is maintained across different task contexts. Here, we focus on the task contexts of brain-machine interface (BMI) training and online control, different contexts that have led to substantial changes in neural behavior in prior studies in motor cortex. We find that the structure of the representation of different movement conditions is largely maintained between the two contexts and that the different representations can all be separately decoded and used for online BMI control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Marked elevation in the brain concentration of N‐acetyl‐L‐aspartate (NAA) is a characteristic feature of Canavan disease, a vacuolar leukodystrophy resulting from deficiency of the oligodendroglial NAA‐cleaving enzyme aspartoacylase. We now demonstrate that inhibiting NAA synthesis by intracisternal administration of a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide to young‐adult aspartoacylase‐deficient mice reverses their pre‐existing ataxia and diminishes cerebellar and thalamic vacuolation and Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Active inference is a normative principle underwriting perception, action,
planning, decision-making and learning in biological or artificial agents. From
its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex
generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours.
Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to
see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical
implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a
complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete state-space
models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives
neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological
processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed
to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous
sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as
follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on
how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a
pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used
to make empirical predictions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were inspired by early findings in the
study of biological vision. They have since become successful tools in computer
vision and state-of-the-art models of both neural activity and behavior on
visual tasks. This review highlights what, in the context of CNNs, it means to
be a good model in computational neuroscience and the various ways models can
provide insight. Specifically, it covers the origins of CNNs and the methods by
which we validate them as models of biological vision. It then goes on to
elaborate on what we can learn about biological vision by understanding and
experimenting on CNNs and discusses emerging opportunities for the use of CNNS
in vision research beyond basic object recognition.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although lagging behind classical computational neuroscience, theoretical and
computational approaches are beginning to emerge to characterize different
aspects of neuron-glial interactions. This chapter aims to provide essential
knowledge on neuron-glial interactions in the mammalian brain, leveraging on
computational studies that focus on structure (anatomy) and function
(physiology) of such interactions in the healthy brain. Although our
understanding of the need of neuron-glial interactions in the brain is still at
its infancy, being mostly based on predictions that await for experimental
validation, simple general modeling arguments borrowed from control theory are
introduced to support the importance of including such interactions in
traditional neuron-based modeling paradigms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06605</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been well established that Functional Connectomes (FCs), as estimated
from functional MRI (fMRI) data, have an individual fingerprint that can be
used to identify an individual from a population (subject-identification).
Although identification rate is high when using resting-state FCs, other tasks
show moderate to low values. Furthermore, identification rate is
task-dependent, and is low when distinct cognitive states, as captured by
different fMRI tasks, are compared. Here we propose an embedding framework,
GEFF (Graph Embedding for Functional Fingerprinting), based on group-level
decomposition of FCs into eigenvectors. GEFF creates an eigenspace
representation of a group of subjects using one or more task FCs (Learning
Stage). In the Identification Stage, we compare new instances of FCs from the
Learning subjects within this eigenspace (validation dataset). The validation
dataset contains FCs either from the same tasks as the Learning dataset or from
the remaining tasks that were not included in Learning. Assessment of
validation FCs within the eigenspace results in significantly increased
subject-identification rates for all fMRI tasks tested and potentially
task-independent fingerprinting process. It is noteworthy that combining
resting-state with one fMRI task for GEFF Learning Stage covers most of the
cognitive space for subject identification. In addition to
subject-identification, GEFF was also used for identification of cognitive
states, i.e. to identify the task associated to a given FC, regardless of the
subject being already in the Learning dataset or not (subject-independent
task-identification). In addition, we also show that eigenvectors from the
Learning Stage can be characterized as task-dominant, subject dominant or
neither, providing a deeper insight into the extent of variance in functional
connectivity across individuals and cognitive states.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired machine learning algorithm,
is closer to the computing mechanism of human brain and more suitable to reveal
the essence of intelligence compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
attracting more and more attention in recent years. In addition, the
information processed by SNN is in the form of discrete spikes, which makes SNN
have low power consumption characteristics. In this paper, we propose an
efficient and strong unsupervised SNN named BioSNet with high biological
plausibility to handle image classification tasks. In BioSNet, we propose a new
biomimetic spiking neuron model named MRON inspired by 'recognition memory' in
the human brain, design an efficient and robust network architecture
corresponding to biological characteristics of the human brain as well, and
extend the traditional voting mechanism to the Vote-for-All (VFA) decoding
layer so as to reduce information loss during decoding. Simulation results show
that BioSNet not only achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised classification
accuracy on MNIST/EMNIST data sets, but also exhibits superior learning
efficiency and high robustness. Specifically, the BioSNet trained with only
dozens of samples per class can achieve a favorable classification accuracy
over 80% and randomly deleting even 95% of synapses or neurons in the BioSNet
only leads to slight performance degradation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A number of observations in recent years demonstrates that across all levels of organization, memory is inherently fluid. On the cognitive-behavioral level, the innocent act of remembering can irrevocably alter the contents of established long-term memories, while the content of dormant long-term memories that is deemed irrelevant, superfluous, or limiting may be pragmatically erased or suppressed. On the cellular level, the proteins implementing the molecular alterations underpinning memories are in a constant state of flux, with proteins being turned over, translocated, reconfigured, substituted, and replaced. Yet, the general perception of memory, and the words used to describe it, suggest a static system characterized by the goal of preserving records of past experiences with high fidelity, in contrast to the reality of an inherently adaptive system purposed to enable survival in a changing world with a pragmatic disregard for the fate of acquired memories. Here, we examine present memory terminology and how it corresponds to our actual understanding of the molecules, cells, and systems underlying memory. We will identify where terms lead us astray and line out possible ways to reform memory nomenclature to better fit the true nature of memory as we begin to know it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quality assessment of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data is essential prior to any analysis, so that appropriate pre-processing can be used to improve data quality and ensure that the presence of MRI artifacts do not affect the results of subsequent image analysis. Manual quality assessment of the data is subjective, possibly error-prone, and infeasible, especially considering the growing number of consortium-like studies, underlining the need for automation of the process. In this paper, we have developed a deep-learning-based automated quality control (QC) tool, QC-Automator, for dMRI data, that can handle a variety of artifacts such as motion, multiband interleaving, ghosting, susceptibility, herringbone, and chemical shifts. QC-Automator uses convolutional neural networks along with transfer learning to train the automated artifact detection on a labeled dataset of ∼332,000 slices of dMRI data, from 155 unique subjects and 5 scanners with different dMRI acquisitions, achieving a 98% accuracy in detecting artifacts. The method is fast and paves the way for efficient and effective artifact detection in large datasets. It is also demonstrated to be replicable on other datasets with different acquisition parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a relatively recent concept in neuroscience that broadly describes the relationship between brain cells and their blood vessels. The NVU incorporates cellular and extracellular components involved in regulating cerebral blood flow and blood–brain barrier function. The NVU within the adult brain has attracted strong research interest and its structure and function is well described, however, the NVU in the developing brain over the fetal and neonatal period remains much less well known. One area of particular interest in perinatal brain development is the impact of known neuropathological insults on the NVU. The aim of this review is to synthesize existing literature to describe structure and function of the NVU in the developing brain, with a particular emphasis on exploring the effects of perinatal insults. Accordingly, a brief overview of NVU components and function is provided, before discussion of NVU development and how this may be affected by perinatal pathologies. We have focused this discussion around three common perinatal insults: prematurity, acute hypoxia, and chronic hypoxia. A greater understanding of processes affecting the NVU in the perinatal period may enable application of targeted therapies, as well as providing a useful basis for research as it expands further into this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diffusible ions (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) are vital for healthy function of all cells, especially brain cells. Unfortunately, the diffusible nature of these ions renders them difficult to study with traditional microscopy in situ within ex vivo brain tissue sections. This mini-review examines the recent progress in the field, using direct elemental mapping techniques to study ion homeostasis during normal brain physiology and pathophysiology, through measurement of ion distribution and concentration in ex vivo brain tissue sections. The mini-review examines the advantages and limitations of specific techniques: proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and the sample preparation requirements to study diffusible ions with these methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity. A collection of associated methods aims to replicate observations made in humans and to identify the mechanisms underlying the distributed neuronal activity in the healthy and disordered brain. Animal fMRI studies have developed rapidly over the past years, fueled by the development of resting-state fMRI connectivity and genetically encoded neuromodulatory tools. Yet, comparisons between sites remain hampered by lack of standardization. Recently, we highlighted that mouse resting-state functional connectivity converges across centers, although large discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity remained. Here, we explore past and present trends within the animal fMRI community and highlight critical aspects in study design, data acquisition, and post-processing operations, that may affect the results and influence the comparability between studies. We also suggest practices aimed to promote the adoption of standards within the community and improve between-lab reproducibility. The implementation of standardized animal neuroimaging protocols will facilitate animal population imaging efforts as well as meta-analysis and replication studies, the gold standards in evidence-based science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Tai Chi Chuan on Inhibitory Control in Elderly Women: An fNIRS Study</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control is a sub-ability of executive function and plays an important role in the entire cognitive process. However, declines in inhibitory control during aging significantly impair the quality of life of elderly people. Investigating methods to delay the decline of inhibitory control has become a focal point in current research. Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) is one effective method used to delay cognitive declines in older adults. However, the specific effects of TCC on inhibitory control and the mechanisms through which TCC may improve cognition in older adults have not been comprehensively investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The study explores possible neurological mechanisms related to the effects of TCC interventions on inhibitory control in older people using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique and reaction times (RTs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 26 healthy, elderly people who had not received TCC training completed all study procedures. The subjects were randomized to either the TCC group or the control group. Subjects in the TCC group were taught TCC by a certified instructor and trained for 8 weeks. The control group continued to perform general daily activities. The Flanker task was administered to every participant to evaluate inhibitory control pre- and post-intervention. While participants were performing the Flanker task, fNIRS data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Post-intervention, significant differences for incongruent flankers were found only for the TCC intervention group. Faster RTs were observed for the incongruent flankers in the TCC group than in the control group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Analysis of the fNIRS data revealed an increase in oxy-Hb in the prefrontal cortex during the incongruent flankers after the TCC exercise intervention.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The TCC intervention significantly improved inhibitory control in older adults, suggesting that TCC is an effective, suitable exercise for improving executive function and neurological health in elderly people.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR1900028457.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Revealing Changes in Brain Functional Networks Caused by Focused-Attention Meditation Using Tucker3 Clustering</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study examines the effects of focused-attention meditation on functional brain states in novice meditators. There are a number of feature metrics for functional brain states, such as functional connectivity, graph theoretical metrics, and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF). It is necessary to choose appropriate metrics and also to specify the region of interests (ROIs) from a number of brain regions. Here, we use a Tucker3 clustering method, which simultaneously selects the feature vectors (graph theoretical metrics and fractional ALFF) and the ROIs that can discriminate between resting and meditative states based on the characteristics of the given data. In this study, breath-counting meditation, one of the most popular forms of focused-attention meditation, was used and brain activities during resting and meditation states were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicated that the clustering coefficients of the eight brain regions, Frontal Inf Oper L, Occipital Inf R, ParaHippocampal R, Cerebellum 10 R, Cingulum Mid R, Cerebellum Crus1 L, Occipital Inf L, and Paracentral Lobule R increased through the meditation. Our study also provided the framework of data-driven brain functional analysis and confirmed its effectiveness on analyzing neural basis of focused-attention meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural processing of sounds in the dorsal and ventral streams of the (human) auditory cortex is optimized for analyzing fine-grained temporal and spectral information, respectively. Here we use a Wilson and Cowan firing-rate modeling framework to simulate spectro-temporal processing of sounds in these auditory streams and to investigate the link between neural population activity and behavioral results of psychoacoustic experiments. The proposed model consisted of two core (A1 and R, representing primary areas) and two belt (Slow and Fast, representing rostral and caudal processing respectively) areas, differing in terms of their spectral and temporal response properties. First, we simulated the responses to amplitude modulated (AM) noise and tones. In agreement with electrophysiological results, we observed an area-dependent transition from a temporal (synchronization) to a rate code when moving from low to high modulation rates. Simulated neural responses in a task of amplitude modulation detection suggested that thresholds derived from population responses in core areas closely resembled those of psychoacoustic experiments in human listeners. For tones, simulated modulation threshold functions were found to be dependent on the carrier frequency. Second, we simulated the responses to complex tones with missing fundamental stimuli and found that synchronization of responses in the Fast area accurately encoded pitch, with the strength of synchronization depending on number and order of harmonic components. Finally, using speech stimuli, we showed that the spectral and temporal structure of the speech was reflected in parallel by the modeled areas. The analyses highlighted that the Slow stream coded with high spectral precision the aspects of the speech signal characterized by slow temporal changes (e.g., prosody), while the Fast stream encoded primarily the faster changes (e.g., phonemes, consonants, temporal pitch). Interestingly, the pitch of a speaker was encoded both spatially (i.e., tonotopically) in Slow area and temporally in Fast area. Overall, performed simulations showed that the model is valuable for generating hypotheses on how the different cortical areas/streams may contribute toward behaviorally relevant aspects of auditory processing. The model can be used in combination with physiological models of neurovascular coupling to generate predictions for human functional MRI experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Computational Model of Interactions Between Neuronal and Astrocytic Networks: The Role of Astrocytes in the Stability of the Neuronal Firing Rate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00092</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research in neuroscience indicates the importance of tripartite synapses and gliotransmission mediated by astrocytes in neuronal system modulation. Although the astrocyte and neuronal network functions are interrelated, they are fundamentally different in their signaling patterns and, possibly, the time scales at which they operate. However, the exact nature of gliotransmission and the effect of the tripartite synapse function at the network level are currently elusive. In this paper, we propose a computational model of interactions between an astrocyte network and a neuron network, starting from tripartite synapses and spanning to a joint network level. Our model focuses on a two-dimensional setup emulating a mixed in vitro neuron-astrocyte cell culture. The model depicts astrocyte-released gliotransmitters exerting opposing effects on the neurons: increasing the release probability of the presynaptic neuron while hyperpolarizing the post-synaptic one at a longer time scale. We simulated the joint networks with various levels of astrocyte contributions and neuronal activity levels. Our results indicate that astrocytes prolong the burst duration of neurons, while restricting hyperactivity. Thus, in our model, the effect of astrocytes is homeostatic; the firing rate of the network stabilizes to an intermediate level independently of neuronal base activity. Our computational model highlights the plausible roles of astrocytes in interconnected astrocytic and neuronal networks. Our simulations support recent findings in neurons and astrocytes in vivo and in vitro suggesting that astrocytic networks provide a modulatory role in the bursting of the neuronal network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex environments provide structured yet variable sensory inputs. To best exploit information from these environments, organisms must evolve the ability to anticipate consequences of new stimuli, and act on these predictions. We propose an evolutionary path for neural networks, leading an organism from reactive behavior to simple proactive behavior and from simple proactive behavior to induction-based behavior. Based on earlier in-vitro and in-silico experiments, we define the conditions necessary in a network with spike-timing dependent plasticity for the organism to go from reactive to proactive behavior. Our results support the existence of specific evolutionary steps and four conditions necessary for embodied neural networks to evolve predictive and inductive abilities from an initial reactive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reversible Loss of Hippocampal Function in a Mouse Model of Demyelination/Remyelination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Demyelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases. Cycles of demyelination, followed by remyelination, appear in the majority of MS patients and are associated with the onset and quiescence of disease-related symptoms, respectively. Previous studies in human patients and animal models have shown that vast demyelination is accompanied by wide-scale changes to brain activity, but details of this process are poorly understood. We used electrophysiological recordings and non-linear fluorescence imaging from genetically encoded calcium indicators to monitor the activity of hippocampal neurons during demyelination and remyelination over a period of 100 days. We found that synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons was diminished in vitro, and that neuronal firing rates in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) were substantially reduced during demyelination in vivo, which partially recovered after a short remyelination period. This new approach allows monitoring how changes in synaptic transmission induced by cuprizone diet affect neuronal activity, and it can potentially be used to study the effects of therapeutic interventions in protecting the functionality of CNS neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Diversity of Axonal and Dendritic Contributions to Neuronal Output</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our general understanding of neuronal function is that dendrites receive information that is transmitted to the axon, where action potentials (APs) are initiated and propagated to eventually trigger neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals. Even though this canonical division of labor is true for a number of neuronal types in the mammalian brain (including neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons or cerebellar Purkinje neurons), many neuronal types do not comply with this classical polarity scheme. In fact, dendrites can be the site of AP initiation and propagation, and even neurotransmitter release. In several interneuron types, all functions are carried out by dendrites as these neurons are devoid of a canonical axon. In this article, we present a few examples of “misbehaving” neurons (with a non-canonical polarity scheme) to highlight the diversity of solutions that are used by mammalian neurons to transmit information. Moreover, we discuss how the contribution of dendrites and axons to neuronal excitability may impose constraints on the morphology of these compartments in specific functional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Multiple Morphometric Assessment of Microglial Cells in Deafferented Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia (MG) are the first cells to react to the abnormal incoming signals that follow an injury of sensory nerves and play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, a common sequel of nerve injuries. Here we present population data on cell number, soma size, and length of processes of MG in the caudal division of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5C) in control mice and at the peak of microgliosis (7 days) following unilateral transection of the infraorbital nerve (IoN). The study is performed combining several bias- and assumption-free imaging and stereological approaches with different immunolabeling procedures, with the objective of tackling some hard problems that often hinder proper execution of MG morphometric studies. Our approach may easily be applied to low-density MG populations, but also works, with limited biases, in territories where MG cell bodies and processes form dense meshworks. In controls, and contralaterally to the deafferented side, MG cell body size and shape and branching pattern matched well the descriptions of “resting” or “surveillant” MG described elsewhere, with only moderate intersubject variability. On the superficial laminae of the deafferented side, however, MG displayed on average larger somata and remarkable diversity in shape. The number of cells and the length of MG processes per mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; increased 5 and 2.5 times, respectively, indicating a net 50% decrease in the mean length of processes per cell. By using specific immunolabeling and cell sorting of vascular macrophages, we found only a negligible fraction of these cells in Sp5C, with no differences between controls and deafferented animals, suggesting that blood-borne monocytes play at most a very limited role in the microgliosis occurring following sensory nerve deafferentation. In sum, here we present reliable morphometric data on MG in control and deafferented trigeminal nuclei using efficient methods that we propose may equally be applied to any morphometric population analysis of these cells under different physiological or pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Intranasal Orexin-A (Hypocretin-1) Administration on Neuronal Activation, Neurochemistry, and Attention in Aged Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function represents a key determinative factor for independent functioning among the elderly, especially among those with age-related cognitive disorders. However; existing pharmacotherapeutic tactics for treating these disorders provide only modest benefits on cognition. The hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system is uniquely positioned, anatomically and functionally, to integrate physiological functions that support proper cognition. The ongoing paucity of orexin receptor agonists has mired the ability to study their potential as cognitive enhancers. Fortunately, intranasal administration of native orexin peptides circumvents this issue and others concerning peptide transport into the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate the ability of intranasal orexin-A (OxA) administration to improve the anatomical, neurochemical, and behavioral substrates of age-related cognitive dysfunction, these studies utilized a rodent model of aging combined with acute intranasal administration of saline or OxA. Here, intranasal OxA increases c-Fos expression in several telencephalic brain regions that mediate important cognitive functions, increases prefrontal cortical acetylcholine efflux, and alters set-shifting-mediated attentional function in rats. Ultimately, these studies provide a framework for the possible mechanisms and therapeutic potential of intranasal OxA in treating age-related cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes a lifelong infection through establishment of latency. Although reactivation from latency can cause life-threatening disease, our molecular understanding of HCMV latency is incomplete. Here we use single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize latency in monocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In monocytes, we identify host cell surface markers that enable enrichment of latent cells harboring higher viral transcript levels, which can reactivate more efficiently, and are characterized by reduced intrinsic immune response that is important for viral gene expression. Significantly, in latent HSPCs, viral transcripts could be detected only in monocyte progenitors and were also associated with reduced immune-response. Overall, our work indicates that regardless of the developmental stage in which HCMV infects, HCMV drives hematopoietic cells towards a weaker immune-responsive monocyte state and that this anergic-like state is crucial for the virus ability to express its transcripts and to eventually reactivate.</description>

	<description>Magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) non-invasively record human brain activity with millisecond resolution providing reliable markers of healthy and disease states. Relating these macroscopic signals to underlying cellular- and circuit-level generators is a limitation that constrains using MEG/EEG to reveal novel principles of information processing or to translate findings into new therapies for neuropathology. To address this problem, we built Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN, https://hnn.brown.edu) software. HNN has a graphical user interface designed to help researchers and clinicians interpret the neural origins of MEG/EEG. HNN's core is a neocortical circuit model that accounts for biophysical origins of electrical currents generating MEG/EEG. Data can be directly compared to simulated signals and parameters easily manipulated to develop/test hypotheses on a signal's origin. Tutorials teach users to simulate commonly measured signals, including event related potentials and brain rhythms. HNN's ability to associate signals across scales makes it a unique tool for translational neuroscience research.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Stepwise polarisation of developing bilayered epidermis is mediated by aPKC and E-cadherin in zebrafish</title>

	<description>The epidermis, a multilayered epithelium, surrounds and protects the vertebrate body. It develops from a bilayered epithelium formed of the outer periderm and underlying basal epidermis. How apicobasal polarity is established in the developing epidermis has remained poorly understood. We show that both the periderm and the basal epidermis exhibit polarised distribution of adherens junctions in zebrafish. aPKC, an apical polarity regulator, maintains the robustness of polarisation of E-cadherin- an adherens junction component- in the periderm. E-cadherin in one layer controls the localisation of E-cadherin in the second layer in a layer non-autonomous manner. Importantly, E-cadherin controls the localisation and levels of Lgl, a basolateral polarity regulator, in a layer autonomous as well non-autonomous manner. Since periderm formation from the enveloping layer precedes the formation of the basal epidermis, our analyses suggest that peridermal polarity, initiated by aPKC, is transduced in a stepwise manner by E-cadherin to the basal layer.</description>

	<description>Neuronal population responses can vary across trials as a result of differences in the relative timing of internal brain processes. In this issue of Neuron, Williams et al. (2020) present an algorithm for inferring and inverting such trial-to-trial differences, thereby revealing an a priori hidden, precise temporal structure of population responses.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Learning spatiotemporal signals using a recurrent spiking network that discretizes time</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Amadeus Maes, Mauricio Barahona, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

Learning to produce spatiotemporal sequences is a common task that the brain has to solve. The same neural substrate may be used by the brain to produce different sequential behaviours. The way the brain learns and encodes such tasks remains unknown as current computational models do not typically use realistic biologically-plausible learning. Here, we propose a model where a spiking recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory biophysical neurons drives a read-out layer: the dynamics of the driver recurrent network is trained to encode time which is then mapped through the read-out neurons to encode another dimension, such as space or a phase. Different spatiotemporal patterns can be learned and encoded through the synaptic weights to the read-out neurons that follow common Hebbian learning rules. We demonstrate that the model is able to learn spatiotemporal dynamics on time scales that are behaviourally relevant and we show that the learned sequences are robustly replayed during a regime of spontaneous activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hPSUoC3dZgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Collaboration leads to cooperation on sparse networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon D. Angus, Jonathan Newton&lt;/p&gt;

For almost four decades, cooperation has been studied through the lens of the prisoner’s dilemma game, with cooperation modelled as the play of a specific strategy. However, an alternative approach to cooperative behavior has recently been proposed. Known as collaboration, the new approach considers mutualistic strategic choice and can be applied to any game. Here, we bring these approaches together and study the effect of collaboration on cooperative dynamics in the standard prisoner’s dilemma setting. It turns out that, from a baseline of zero cooperation in the absence of collaboration, even relatively rare opportunities to collaborate can support material, and robust, levels of cooperation. This effect is mediated by the interaction structure, such that collaboration leads to greater levels of cooperation when each individual strategically interacts with relatively few other individuals, matching well-known characteristics of human interaction networks. Conversely, collaboratively induced cooperation vanishes from dense networks, thus placing environmental limits on collaboration’s successful role in cooperation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hY3eRymbwKc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In pathology, tissue images are evaluated using a light microscope, relying on the expertise and experience of pathologists. There is a great need for computational methods to quantify and standardize histological observations. Computational quantification methods become more and more essential to evaluate tissue images. In particular, the distribution of tumor cells and their microenvironment are of special interest. Here, we systematically investigated tumor cell properties and their spatial neighborhood relations by a new application of statistical analysis to whole slide images of Hodgkin lymphoma, a tumor arising in lymph nodes, and inflammation of lymph nodes called lymphadenitis. We considered properties of more than 400, 000 immunohistochemically stained, CD30-positive cells in 35 whole slide images of tissue sections from subtypes of the classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity, as well as from lymphadenitis. We found that cells of specific morphology exhibited significant favored and unfavored spatial neighborhood relations of cells in dependence of their morphology. This information is important to evaluate differences between Hodgkin lymph nodes infiltrated by tumor cells (Hodgkin lymphoma) and inflamed lymph nodes, concerning the neighborhood relations of cells and the sizes of cells. The quantification of neighborhood relations revealed new insights of relations of CD30-positive cells in different diagnosis cases. The approach is general and can easily be applied to whole slide image analysis of other tumor types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uCnNctQlb8g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

For women with access to healthcare and early detection, breast cancer deaths are caused primarily by metastasis rather than growth of the primary tumor. Metastasis has been difficult to study because it happens deep in the body, occurs over years, and involves a small fraction of cells from the primary tumor. Furthermore, within-tumor heterogeneity relevant to metastasis can also lead to therapy failures and is obscured by studies of bulk tissue. Here we exploit heterogeneity to identify molecular mechanisms of metastasis. We use “organoids”, groups of hundreds of tumor cells taken from a patient and grown in the lab, to probe tumor heterogeneity, with potentially thousands of organoids generated from a single tumor. We show that organoids have the character of biological replicates: within-tumor and between-tumor variation are of similar magnitude. We develop new methods based on population genetics and variance components models to build between-tumor and within-tumor statistical tests, using organoids analogously to large sibships and vastly amplifying the test power. We show great efficiency for tests based on the organoids with the most extreme phenotypes and potential cost savings from pooled tests of the extreme tails, with organoids generated from hundreds of tumors having power predicted to be similar to bulk tests of hundreds of thousands of tumors. We apply these methods to an association test for molecular correlates of invasion, using a novel quantitative invasion phenotype calculated as the spectral power of the organoid boundary. These new approaches combine to show a strong association between invasion and protein expression of Keratin 14, a known biomarker for poor prognosis, with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt; for within-tumor tests of individual organoids and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; for pooled tests of extreme tails. Future studies using these methods could lead to discoveries of new classes of cancer targets and development of corresponding therapeutics.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Optimizing Patient Selection for Endovascular Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke (SELECT): A Prospective, Multicenter Cohort Study of Imaging Selection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25669?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25669?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary imaging modalities used to select patients for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) are noncontrast computed tomography (CT) and CT perfusion (CTP). However, their relative utility is uncertain. We prospectively assessed CT and CTP concordance/discordance and correlated the imaging profiles on both with EVT treatment decisions and clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phase 2, multicenter, prospective cohort study of large‐vessel occlusions presented up to 24 hours from last known well was conducted. Patients received a unified prespecified imaging evaluation (CT, CT angiography, and CTP with Rapid Processing of Perfusion and Diffusion software mismatch determination). The treatment decision, EVT versus medical management, was nonrandomized and at the treating physicians’ discretion. An independent, blinded, neuroimaging core laboratory adjudicated favorable profiles based on predefined criteria (CT:Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ≥ 6, CTP:regional cerebral blood flow (&amp;lt;30%) &amp;lt; 70ml with mismatch ratio ≥ 1.2 and mismatch volume ≥ 10ml).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 4,722 patients screened from January 2016 to February 2018, 361 patients were included. Two hundred eighty‐five (79%) received EVT, of whom 87.0% had favorable CTs, 91% favorable CTPs, 81% both favorable profiles, 16% discordant, and 3% both unfavorable. Favorable profiles on the 2 modalities correlated similarly with 90‐day functional independence rates (favorable CT = 56% vs favorable CTP = 57%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.40–9.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.41). Having a favorable profile on both modalities significantly increased the odds of receiving thrombectomy as compared to discordant profiles (aOR = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.97–8.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Fifty‐eight percent of the patients with favorable profiles on both modalities achieved functional independence as compared to 38% in discordant profiles and 0% when both were unfavorable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for trend). In favorable CT/unfavorable CTP profiles, EVT was associated with high symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (24%) and mortality (53%) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with favorable imaging profiles on both modalities had higher odds of receiving EVT and high functional independence rates. Patients with discordant profiles achieved reasonable functional independence rates, but those with an unfavorable CTP had higher adverse outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain is pivotal for the development of the newborn, which receives its commensal microbiota at birth; dysbiosis may result in altered neurodevelopment. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is actively involved in the stress response but is undeveloped in the newborn. Here, we describe how changes in the commensal microbiota influence the normal development of the HPA axis and review recent findings describing the essential crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the HPA axis and suggesting a role for the maternal and commensal microbiota in the development of the HPA axis and of the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Different Activation Mechanisms of Excitatory Networks in the Rat Oculomotor Integrators for Vertical and Horizontal Gaze Holding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0364-19.2019?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0364-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gaze holding in the horizontal and vertical directions is separately controlled via the oculomotor neural integrators, the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), respectively. Our previous &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated that transient, high-frequency local stimulation of the PHN and the INC increased the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs that lasted for several seconds. The sustained EPSC response of PHN neurons was attributed to the activation of local excitatory networks primarily mediated via Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPA (CP-AMPA) receptors and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated nonselective cation (CAN) channels. However, the contribution of CP-AMPA receptors to the activation of INC excitatory networks appeared to be small. In this study, we clarified the mechanisms of excitatory network activation in the PHN and INC using whole-cell recordings in rat brainstem slices. Although physiological and histological analyses showed that neurons that expressed CP-AMPA receptors existed not only in the PHN but also in the INC, the effect of a CP-AMPA receptor antagonist on the sustained EPSC response was significantly weaker in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. Meanwhile, the effect of an NMDA receptor antagonist on the sustained EPSC response was significantly stronger in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. Furthermore, the current and the charge transfer mediated via NMDA receptors were significantly larger in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. These results strongly suggest that these excitatory networks are activated via different synaptic mechanisms: a CP-AMPA receptor and CAN channel-dependent mechanism and an NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism in horizontal and vertical integrators, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cannabinoid signaling recruits astrocytes to modulate presynaptic function in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles in physiology regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain, where daily cues act on SCN neurons to alter clock timing. Cannabinoid signaling modulates SCN neuronal activity, though the mechanism remains unclear. We propose that neuronal activity generates endocannabinoid release, activating astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, which releases adenosine and activates adenosine-1 receptors (A1Rs) on the presynaptic axon terminals, decreasing GABA release. We demonstrated, in mice, that activation of cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1R) with the agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) reduced the miniature GABA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current (mGPSC) frequency by a mechanism that requires astrocytes and A1R. WIN activated an intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathway in astrocytes. Activating this intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pathway with DREADDs also decreased the mGPSC frequency and required A1R activation. The frequency of spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; events, including those induced by depolarization of a postsynaptic SCN neuron, was reduced by blocking CB1R activation with AM251, demonstrating neuronal endocannabinoid signaling modulates astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in the SCN. Finally, daytime application of WIN or adenosine phase advanced the molecular circadian clock, indicating that this cannabinoid signaling pathway is vital for the timing of circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Astrocytes are a critical component of the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) required for the generation of precise circadian rhythms. We hypothesized that postsynaptic SCN neurons recruit astrocytes via endocannabinoid signaling to modulate presynaptic GABA release. We demonstrate, using a combination of approaches including whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, GCaMP6 calcium imaging in astrocytes, pharmacology, and manipulation of intracellular signaling cascades using DREADD technology, that SCN neurons release cannabinoids that activate astrocyte intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathways to modulate GABA neurotransmission via adenosine. In addition to unraveling this novel signaling cascade in the SCN, we demonstrate that both CB1 receptor activation and adenosine phase advance the molecular circadian clock, suggesting an important role for astrocytes in modulating clock timing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Life Course Adiposity and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Study</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25671?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies have indicated that life course adiposity is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether such an association reflects causality remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether life course adiposity such as birth weight (BW), childhood body mass index (BMI), adult BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) have causal effects on ALS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with life course adiposity were used as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects on ALS. We used summary‐level data from a cohort of 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted one standard deviation (1‐SD) increase in BF% was associated with lower risk of ALS (odds ratio [OR] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54–0.83, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.25E–04) after Bonferroni correction (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05/5). Genetically predicted 1‐SD higher childhood BMI was suggestively associated with lower risk of ALS (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78–0.99, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The weighted median method indicated a suggestive association between BMI and ALS (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69–0.96, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.016). Neither a genetically predicted 1‐SD increase in BW (inverse variance weighted [IVW]: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.87–1.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.939) nor WHR adjusted for BMI (IVW: OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.76–1.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.178) was associated with ALS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide novel evidence supporting a causal role of higher adiposity, taken as a whole, on lower risk of ALS. A deeper understanding of the energy metabolism of ALS is more likely to identify feasible nutritional interventions and even novel therapeutic targets that might improve the survival of ALS patients.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dopamine and Noradrenaline in the Brain; Overlapping or Dissociate Functions?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine and noradrenaline are crucial neuromodulators controlling brain states, vigilance, action, reward, learning, and memory processes. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) and Locus Coeruleus (LC) are canonically described as the main sources of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) with dissociate functions. A comparison of diverse studies shows that these neuromodulators largely overlap in multiple domains such as shared biosynthetic pathway and co-release from the LC terminals, convergent innervations, non-specificity of receptors and transporters, and shared intracellular signaling pathways. DA–NA interactions are mainly studied in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, yet it can be extended to the whole brain given the diversity of catecholamine innervations. LC can simultaneously broadcast both dopamine and noradrenaline across the brain. Here, we briefly review the molecular, cellular, and physiological overlaps between DA and NA systems and point to their functional implications. We suggest that DA and NA may function in parallel to facilitate learning and maintain the states required for normal cognitive processes. Various signaling modules of NA and DA have been targeted for developing of therapeutics. Understanding overlaps of the two systems is crucial for more effective interventions in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Abnormal Pyramidal Decussation and Bilateral Projection of the Corticospinal Tract Axons in Mice Lacking the Heparan Sulfate Endosulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00333</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The corticospinal tract (CST) plays an important role in controlling voluntary movement. Because the CST has a long trajectory throughout the brain toward the spinal cord, many axon guidance molecules are required to navigate the axons correctly during development. Previously, we found that double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryos lacking the heparan sulfate endosulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2, showed axon guidance defects of the CST owing to the abnormal accumulation of Slit2 protein on the brain surface. However, postnatal development of the CST, especially the pyramidal decussation and spinal cord projection, could not be assessed because DKO mice on a C57BL/6 background died soon after birth. We recently found that Sulf1/2 DKO mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and CD-1/ICR background can survive into adulthood and therefore investigated the anatomy and function of the CST in the adult DKO mice. In Sulf1/2 DKO mice, abnormal dorsal deviation of the CST fibers on the midbrain surface persisted after maturation of the CST. At the pyramidal decussation, some CST fibers located near the midline crossed the midline, whereas others located more laterally extended ipsilaterally. In the spinal cord, the crossed CST fibers descended in the dorsal funiculus on the contralateral side and entered the contralateral gray matter normally, whereas the uncrossed fibers descended in the lateral funiculus on the ipsilateral side and entered the ipsilateral gray matter. As a result, the CST fibers that originated from 1 side of the brain projected bilaterally in the DKO spinal cord. Consistently, microstimulation of 1 side of the motor cortex evoked electromyogram responses only in the contralateral forelimb muscles of the wild-type mice, whereas the same stimulation evoked bilateral responses in the DKO mice. The functional consequences of the CST defects in the Sulf1/2 DKO mice were examined using the grid-walking, staircase, and single pellet-reaching tests, which have been used to evaluate motor function in mice. Compared with the wild-type mice, the Sulf1/2 DKO mice showed impaired performance in these tests, indicating deficits in motor function. These findings suggest that disruption of Sulf1/2 genes leads to both anatomical and functional defects of the CST.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Gene Expression Patterns Between Apical and Basal Inner Hair Cells Revealed by RNA-Seq</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tonotopic differences in the structure and physiological function, e.g., synapse number, membrane properties, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of exocytosis and vesicle pool replenishment of inner hair cells (IHCs) along the longitudinal cochlear axis have recently been discovered, suggesting different gene expression patterns of IHCs. To determine whether IHCs present different gene expression patterns along the longitudinal cochlear axis, apical and basal IHCs were collected separately using the suction pipette technique from adult mouse cochleae for RNA-seq and genome-wide transcriptome analysis. We found 689 annotated genes showed more than 2-fold increase in expression. Interestingly, 93.4% of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was upregulated in apical IHCs. Although a subset of genes that related to IHC machinery and deafness were found to be differentially expressed, a gradient of gene expression was indeed detected in Ocm, Pvalb, Prkd1, Fbxo32, Nme2, and Sncg, which may play putative roles in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering and survival regulation. The expression of these genes was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or immunostaining. We conclude that IHCs from different mouse cochlear longitudinal position have different gene expression profiles. Our data might serve as a valuable resource for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying different biological properties as well as the survival regulation of IHCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury Induces Chronic Glutamatergic Dysfunction in Amygdala Circuitry Known to Regulate Anxiety-Like Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01434</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Up to 50% of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors demonstrate persisting and late-onset anxiety disorders indicative of limbic system dysregulation, yet the pathophysiology underlying the symptoms is unclear. We hypothesize that the development of TBI-induced anxiety-like behavior in an experimental model of TBI is mediated by changes in glutamate neurotransmission within the amygdala. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent midline fluid percussion injury or sham surgery. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed at 7 and 28 days post-injury (DPI) followed by assessment of real-time glutamate neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) using glutamate-selective microelectrode arrays. The expression of anxiety-like behavior at 28 DPI coincided with decreased evoked glutamate release and slower glutamate clearance in the CeA, not BLA. Numerous factors contribute to the changes in glutamate neurotransmission over time. In two additional animal cohorts, protein levels of glutamatergic transporters (Glt-1 and GLAST) and presynaptic modulators of glutamate release (mGluR2, TrkB, BDNF, and glucocorticoid receptors) were quantified using automated capillary western techniques at 28 DPI. Astrocytosis and microglial activation have been shown to drive maladaptive glutamate signaling and were histologically assessed over 28 DPI. Alterations in glutamate neurotransmission could not be explained by changes in protein levels for glutamate transporters, mGluR2 receptors, astrocytosis, and microglial activation. Presynaptic modulators, BDNF and TrkB, were significantly decreased at 28 DPI in the amygdala. Dysfunction in presynaptic regulation of glutamate neurotransmission may contribute to anxiety-related behavior and serve as a therapeutic target to improve circuit function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: The Brand Scandal Spillover Effect at the Country Level: Evidence From Event-Related Potentials</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spillover effect of brand scandals commonly exists, and this effect will damage the image of the company, industry or even country in which the scandal occurred. Most previous studies on the brand scandal spillover effect have mainly focused on the corporate and industry levels. However, with the development of brand internalization and media technology, the spillover effect at the country level is becoming increasingly common. In the current study, we conducted an event-related potentials study to explore the spillover effect of brand scandals on the country level as well as its underlying neural basis. Specifically, we compared consumers’ attitudes toward countries of origin with different stereotypes during different types of brand scandals. When a competence scandal took place in a competence stereotype country, a larger P2 mean amplitude was elicited compared to a warmth stereotype country. When a morality scandal took place in a warmth stereotype country, a larger LPP mean amplitude was induced compared to a competence stereotype country. We explain the current results based on expectancy violations theory. When competence scandals take place in competence stereotype countries, there will be a greater degree of violation of expectations compared with that in warmth stereotype countries, which leads to a negative evaluation of the country of origin. When morality scandals take place in warmth stereotype countries, people had a stronger negative emotional arousal when morality scandals happened in the warmth stereotype country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A New Model of Repetitive Traumatic Brain Injury in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) is a major health care concern that causes substantial neurological impairment. To better understand rTBI, we introduced a new model of rTBI in mice induced by sudden rotation in the coronal plane combined with lateral translation delivered twice at an interval of 24 h. By routine histology, histological examination of Prussian blue-stained sections revealed the presence of microbleed in the corpus callosum and brain stem. Amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and neurofilament heavy-chain (NF-200) immunohistochemistry demonstrated axonal injury following rTBI. Swelling, waving, and enlargement axons were observed in the corpus callosum and brain stem 24 h after injury by Bielschowsky staining. Ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy provided further insights into the existence and progression of axonal injury. rTBI led to widespread astrogliosis and microgliosis in white matter, as well as significantly increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. rTBI mice showed a significantly increased loss of righting reflex (LRR) duration within each time point compared with that of sham animals, which was under 15 min. rTBI mice exhibited depression-like behavior at 1 month. rTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. These results suggested that this model might be suitable for investigating rTBI pathophysiology and evaluating preclinical candidate therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Neuroprotective Effect of Resveratrol via Activation of Sirt1 Signaling in a Rat Model of Combined Diabetes and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01400</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) often coexist in patients because having one of these conditions increases risk for the other. These two diseases share several pathophysiological mechanisms, such as specific inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. It is still unclear exactly which mechanisms associated with DM are responsible for increased AD risk. Studies have found that even transient elevation of brain Aβ levels can allow T2DM to slightly disrupt the neural milieu in a way that encourages pathologies associated with the onset of memory deficits and AD. A recent study argues that a potential common pathogenetic mechanism underlying both DM and AD is evidenced by the cooccurrence of amyloid brain legions and deposits containing both tau and Aβ in pancreatic β cells. Given these links, an investigation detailing disease mechanisms as well as treatment options for patients with cooccurring DM and AD is urgently needed. The biological effects of resveratrol relevant to DM and AD treatment include its abilities to modulate oxidative stress and reduce inflammation. A rat model of DM and concomitant AD was created for this study using intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and hippocampal injection of Aβ1–40 to characterize resveratrol’s potential protective action.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Resveratrol significantly increased the Sirt1 expression, inhibited the memory impairment, the increased acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, interleukin-1β and interleukin 6 levels, and the decreased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione in this rat model of diabetes and concomitant AD. The Sirt 1 inhibitor EX527 partially reversed the effects of resveratrol.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that resveratrol may have a neuroprotective action through activation of Sirt1 signaling in diabetes and AD with concurrent onset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Variability in Executive Control Performance Is Predicted by Physical Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00463</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Physical activity (PA) promotes neurogenesis and has neuroprotective effects on the brain, bolstering the structural and functional resources necessary for improved cognitive functioning. Intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive performance is linked to neuropsychological structure and functional ability. Despite evidence of the neurogenerative and neuroprotective effects of PA, limited investigation into the link between PA and IIV has been conducted. Across three studies we investigate the effect of PA on IIV in reaction time (RT) on three modified Flanker Tasks. The International PA Questionnaire was used to evaluate PA while the Attention Network Test (ANT) and two additional modified Flanker Tasks were used to assess executive control and attentional performance. RT coefficients of variation (RTCV) were calculated for each participant by dividing the standard deviation by the mean RT for each stimuli condition. Analysis revealed that basic RT was not associated with PA nor was PA predictive of IIV on the modified Flanker Tasks. However, three consistent findings emerged from analysis of the ANT. First, RTCV and moderate PA were positively related, such that more self-reported moderate PA was associated with greater IIV. Conversely, RTCV and vigorous PA were negatively related. Finally, when controlling for the effects of PA on IIV in young adults, variability decreases as age increases. In sum, PA is predictive of IIV on attentional and executive control tasks in young adults, though only at particular intensities and on certain tasks, indicating that task type and cognitive load are important determinants of the relationship between PA and cognitive performance. These findings are consistent with prior literature that suggests that the role of PA in young adults is reliant on specific interventions and measures in order to detect effects more readily found in adolescent and aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Space generally overshadows time in the construction of theories in cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, we pivot from the spatial axes to the temporal, analyzing fMRI image series to reveal structures in time rather than space. To determine affinities among global brain patterns at different times, core concepts in network analysis (derived from graph theory) were applied temporally, as relations among brain images at every time point during an fMRI scanning epoch. To explore the temporal structures observed through this adaptation of network analysis, data from 180 subjects in the Human Connectome Project were examined, during two experimental conditions: passive movie viewing and rest. The temporal brain, like the spatial brain, exhibits a modular structure, where “modules” are intermittent (distributed in time). These temporal entities are here referred to as themes. Short sequences of themes – motifs – were studied in sequences from 4 to 11 s in length. Many motifs repeated at constant intervals, and are therefore rhythmic; rhythms, converted to frequencies, were often harmonic. We speculate that the structure and interaction of these global oscillations underwrites the capacity to experience and navigate a world which is both recognizably stable and noticeably changing at every moment – a temporal world. In its temporal structure, this brain-constituted world resembles music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Intra- and Inter-subject Variability in EEG-Based Sensorimotor Brain Computer Interface: A Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) for the rehabilitation of motor impairments exploit sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session (intra-subject) variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches, recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment, which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here, we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people, reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Simultaneous Knockdown of Sprouty2 and PTEN Promotes Axon Elongation of Adult Sensory Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00583</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00583</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sprouty2 (Spry2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) are both well-established regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, and knockdown of Spry2 or PTEN enhances axon regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The major role of Spry2 is the inhibition of the rat sarcoma RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, whereas PTEN acts mainly as an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In non-neuronal cells, Spry2 increases the expression and activity of PTEN, and PTEN enhances the amount of Spry2 by the inhibition of the microRNA-21 (miR-21) that downregulates Spry2. Applying dissociated DRG neuron cultures from wild-type (WT) or Spry2 deficient mice, we demonstrate that PTEN protein was reduced after 72 h during rapid axonal outgrowth on the laminin substrate. Furthermore, PTEN protein was decreased in DRG cultures obtained from homozygous Spry2−/− knockout mice. Vice versa, Spry2 protein was reduced by PTEN siRNA in WT and heterozygous Spry2+/− neurons. Knockdown of PTEN in DRG cultures obtained from homozygous Spry2−/− knockout mice promoted axon elongation without increasing axonal branching. Activation of Akt, but not ERK, was stronger in response to PTEN knockdown in homozygous Spry2−/− DRG neurons than in WT neurons. Together, our study confirms the important role of the signaling modulators Spry2 and PTEN in axon growth of adult DRG neurons. Both function as endogenous inhibitors of neuronal growth factor signaling and their simultaneous knockdown promotes axon elongation more efficiently than the single knockdown of each inhibitor. Furthermore, Spry2 and PTEN are reciprocally downregulated in adult DRG neuron cultures. Axon growth is influenced by multiple factors and our results demonstrate that the endogenous inhibitors of axon growth, Spry2 and PTEN, are co-regulated in adult DRG neuron cultures. Together, our data demonstrate that combined approaches may be more useful to improve nerve regeneration than targeting one single inhibitor of axon growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Fast and Efficient Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Into ATP-Responsive Astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00579</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are multifunctional cells in the CNS, involved in the regulation of neurovascular coupling, the modulation of electrolytes, and the cycling of neurotransmitters at synapses. Induction of astrocytes from stem cells remains a largely underdeveloped area, as current protocols are time consuming, lack granularity in astrocytic subtype generation, and often are not as efficient as neural induction methods. In this paper we present an efficient method to differentiate astrocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells. Our technique uses a cell suspension protocol to produce embryoid bodies (EBs) that are neurally inducted and seeded onto laminin coated surfaces. Plated EBs attach to the surface and release migrating cells to their surrounding environment, which are further inducted into the astrocytic lineage, through an optimized, heparin-based media. Characterization and functional assessment of the cells consists of immunofluorescent labeling for specific astrocytic proteins and sensitivity to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stimulation. Our experimental results show that even at the earliest stages of the protocol, cells are positive for astrocytic markers (GFAP, ALDH1L1, S100β, and GLAST) with variant expression patterns and purinergic receptors (P2Y). Generated astrocytes also exhibit differential Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients upon stimulation with ATP, which evolve over the differentiation period. Metabotropic purinoceptors P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R are expressed and we offer preliminary evidence that metabotropic purinoceptors contribute to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Our protocol is simple, efficient and fast, facilitating its use in multiple investigations, particularly in vitro studies of engineered neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: LincRNA Plays a Role in the Effect of CYP46A1 Polymorphism in Alzheimer’s Disease – Related Pathology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism of the cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) gene is thought to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A single nucleotide polymorphism (T/C) in intron 2, rs754203, has been confirmed to be implicated in AD. Rs754203 is located in the long intronic non-coding RNA (LincRNA) sequence, which has previously been shown to be involved in the pathology of many diseases. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of LincRNA in the CYP46A1 gene expression and related AD pathology. SH-SY5Y cells with overexpressed TT or CC genotype CYP46A1 were used. Through RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA assays, we found that LincRNA can affect the CYP46A1 gene expression and the production of 24-OHC and Aβ. Overexpression of LincRNA can significantly inhibit CYP46A1 expression and 24-OHC production, as well as increasing the Aβ expression level. Silencing of LincRNA confirmed the role that it plays in the regulation of CYP46A1, as well as the production of 24-OHC and Aβ. In addition, this effect was stronger in the A type LincRNA than in the G type LincRNA. Results from dual luciferase assays show that LincRNA inhibited the activity of the CYP46A1 gene promoter. This study indicates a possible novel role of LincRNA and provides a new way to look into the relationship between CYP46A1 polymorphism and AD pathology. This may identify a novel pathway through which to explore AD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to Study Cerebral Hemodynamics in Older Adults During Cognitive and Motor Tasks: A Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The integrity of the frontal areas of the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, are critical to preserve cognition and mobility in late life. Prefrontal cortex regions are involved in executive functions and gait control and have been related to the performance of dual-tasks. Dual-task performance assessment may help identify older adults at risk of negative health outcomes. As an alternative to neuroimaging techniques that do not allow assessment during actual motion, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique that can assess neural activation through the measurement of cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels, while the person is performing a motor task in a natural environment as well as during cognitive tasks. The aim of this review was to describe the use of fNIRS to study frontal lobe hemodynamics during cognitive, motor and dual-tasks in older adults. From the 46 included publications, 20 studies used only cognitive tasks, three studies used motor tasks and 23 used dual-tasks. Our findings suggest that fNIRS detects changes in frontal activation in older adults (cognitively healthy and mild cognitive impairment), especially while performing cognitive and dual-tasks. In both the comparison between older and younger adults, and in people with different neurological conditions, compared to healthier controls, the prefrontal cortex seems to experience a higher activation, which could be interpreted in the context of proposed neural inefficiency and limited capacity models. Further research is needed to establish standardized fNIRS protocols, study the cerebral hemodynamic in different neurological and systemic conditions that might influence cortical activation and explore its role in predicting incident health outcomes such as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Gray Matter Volume Associations With Abnormal Gait Imagery in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: Results of a Cross-Sectional Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have worse gait performance compared to cognitive healthy individuals (CHI). The discrepancy between imagined and performed timed up and go test (TUG), known as the TUG delta time, is a marker of brain gait control impairment in individuals with MCI. The study aims to examine the association between the TUG delta time and brain gray matter (GM) volumes in CHI and individuals with MCI. A total of 326 participants, 156 CHI and 170 MCI, with TUG delta time and a brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were selected in this cross-sectional study. Individuals with MCI were older and had greater (i.e., worst performance) performed TUG and TUG delta time compared to CHI. The GM volume association with TUG delta time was examined in CHI and MCI assuming that increased TUG delta time would be associated with locally decreased GM volumes. No significant association was found in CHI, whereas TUG delta time was negatively associated with the GM volume of the right medial temporal lobe in individuals with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Yeast vacuole fusion requires R-SNARE, Q-SNAREs, and HOPS. A HOPS SM-family subunit binds the R- and Qa-SNAREs. We now report that HOPS binds each of the four SNAREs. HOPS catalyzes fusion when the Q-SNAREs are not pre-assembled, ushering them into a functional complex. Co-incubation of HOPS, proteoliposomes bearing R-SNARE, and proteoliposomes with any two Q-SNAREs yields a rapid-fusion complex with 3 SNAREs in a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-assembly. The missing Q-SNARE then induces sudden fusion. HOPS can 'template' SNARE complex assembly through SM recognition of R- and Qa-SNAREs. Though the Qa-SNARE is essential for spontaneous SNARE assembly, HOPS also assembles a rapid-fusion complex between R- and QbQc-SNARE proteoliposomes in the absence of Qa-SNARE, awaiting Qa for fusion. HOPS-dependent fusion is saturable at low concentrations of each Q-SNARE, showing binding site functionality. HOPS thus tethers membranes, recognizes the R-SNARE, and recognizes Qa or Qb/Qc SNAREs, assembling R+Qa or R+QbQc rapid fusion intermediates.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Specific depletion of the motor protein KIF5B leads to deficits in dendritic transport, synaptic plasticity and memory</title>

	<description>The kinesin I family of motor proteins are crucial for axonal transport, but their roles in dendritic transport and postsynaptic function are not well-defined. Gene duplication and subsequent diversification give rise to three homologous kinesin I proteins (KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C) in vertebrates, but it is not clear whether and how they exhibit functional specificity. Here we show that knockdown of KIF5A or KIF5B differentially affects excitatory synapses and dendritic transport in hippocampal neurons. The functional specificities of the two kinesins are determined by their diverse carboxyl-termini, where arginine methylation occurs in KIF5B and regulates its function. KIF5B conditional knockout mice exhibit deficits in dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Our findings provide insights into how expansion of the kinesin I family during evolution leads to diversification and specialization of motor proteins in regulating postsynaptic function.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: LRIT3 is required for Nyctalopin expression and normal ON and OFF pathway signaling in the retina</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The first retinal synapse, photoreceptor-&amp;gt;bipolar cell (BC), is both anatomically and functionally complex. Within the same synaptic region, a change in presynaptic glutamate release is sensed by both ON BCs (DBCs) via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), and OFF BCs (HBCs) via ionotropic glutamate receptors to establish parallel signaling pathways that preferentially encode light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF), respectively. The synaptic structural organization of ON and OFF-type BCs at the photoreceptor terminal differs. DBCs make an invaginating synapse that contains a diverse but incompletely understood complex of interacting proteins (signalplex). HBCs make primarily flat contacts that contain an apparent different set of proteins that is equally uncharacterized. LRIT3 is a synaptic protein known to be essential for ON pathway visual function. In both male and female mice, we demonstrate that LRIT3 interacts with and is required for expression of Nyctalopin, and thus TRPM1 at all DBC dendritic tips, but DBC signalplex components are not required for LRIT3 expression. Using whole-cell and multi-electrode array electrophysiology and glutamate imaging, we demonstrate that the loss of LRIT3 impacts both ON and OFF signaling pathway function. Without LRIT3, excitatory input to type 1 BCs is reduced, as are the visually evoked responses of many OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We conclude that the absence of LRIT3 expression disrupts excitatory input to OFF BCs and, thus disrupts the normal function of OFF RGCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At the first visual synapse, photoreceptor cells signal to two distinct BC populations, one characterized by a depolarizing response to light onset (ON or DBCs), the other by a hyperpolarizing response (OFF or HBCs). The DBC light response depends on a G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor and associated protein complex, known as the DBC signalplex. Loss of function mutations in signalplex proteins lead to loss of scotopic visual function, and causes congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in humans. Here we show how the loss of LRIT3, a previously identified signalplex protein, not only prevents functional assembly of the DBC signalplex, but also alters visual function through both ON and OFF signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Free-ranging dogs do not distinguish between barks without context. (arXiv:2001.06415v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Canids display a vast diversity of social organizations, from solitary-living
to pairs to packs. Domestic dogs have descended from pack-living gray wolf-like
ancestors. Unlike their group living ancestors, free-ranging dogs are
facultatively social, preferring to forage solitarily. They are scavengers by
nature, mostly dependent on human garbage and generosity for their sustenance.
Free-ranging dogs are highly territorial, often defending their territories
using vocalizations. Vocal communication plays a critical role between inter
and intraspecies and group interaction and maintaining their social dynamics.
Barking is the most common among the different types of vocalizations of dogs.
Dogs have a broad hearing range and can respond to sounds over long distances.
Domestic dogs have been shown to have the ability to distinguish between
barking in different contexts. Since free-ranging dogs regularly engage in
various kinds of interactions with each other, it is interesting to know
whether they are capable of distinguishing between vocalizations of their own
and other groups. In this study, a playback experiment was used to test if dogs
can distinguish between barking of their own group member from a non-group
member. Though dogs respond to barking from other groups in territorial
exchanges, they did not respond differently to the self and other group barking
in the playback experiments. This suggests a role of context in the
interactions between dogs and opens up possibilities for future studies on the
comparison of the responses of dogs in playback experiments with their natural
behavior through long-term observations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A technical critique of the free energy principle as presented in &quot;Life as we know it&quot;. (arXiv:2001.06408v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We summarize the argument in Friston (2013,
https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2013.0475&quot;&gt;2013.0475&lt;/a&gt;) and highlight some technical errors. We
also discuss how these errors affect the similar Friston (2014,
https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2014.23062&quot;&gt;2014.23062&lt;/a&gt;51). The errors call into question the
purported interpretation that the internal coordinates of every system with a
Markov blanket will appear to engage in Bayesian inference. In particular, we
identify three formal errors in the main argument of Friston (2013): The first
concerns the rewriting of the equations of motion of systems with Markov
blankets which turns out not to be equivalent. We prove the non-equivalence
with a counterexample that exhibits a Markov blanket but does not satisfy the
rewritten equations. Our counterexample also invalidates the corresponding (but
more general) rewritten equations in the more recent Friston (2019,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1906.10184&quot;&gt;arXiv:1906.10184v1&lt;/a&gt; ). The second error is the lack of a proof of the existence
of the free energy as claimed by the Free Energy Lemma. The third is the
assumption that a non-negative function whose gradient vanishes at some point
necessarily has a minimum at that point and that its value at this minimum is
zero. However, if the function is constant, which is the case here, its
gradient vanishes everywhere, it has no minimum at any point, and its value can
be arbitrarily large. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges
on this point, and we hence conclude that it is unjustified.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic core-periphery structure of information sharing networks in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. (arXiv:2001.06371v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural computation is associated with the emergence, reconfiguration and
dissolution of cell assemblies in the context of varying oscillatory states.
Here, we describe the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of cell assemblies
through temporal network formalism. We use a sliding window approach to extract
sequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus
and enthorinal cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise
functional connectivity properties evolve along time. First, we find that
information sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery structure
in which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units
link to more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating
to the core or to the periphery substantially change across time-windows.
Second, we find that discrete network states can be defined on top of this
continuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching between
network states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to
the core and is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory
states. Third, we characterize different styles of temporal connectivity that
cells can exhibit within each state of the sharing network. While inhibitory
cells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization only
poorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells.
Cells can also change temporal connectivity style when the network changes
state. Altogether, these findings reveal that the sharing of information
mediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and enthorinal cortex cell
assemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been
identified by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional
connectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural coincidence detection strategies during perception of multi-pitch musical tones. (arXiv:2001.06212v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06212</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06212</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-pitch perception is investigated in a listening test using 30
recordings of musical sounds with two tones played simultaneously, except for
two gong sounds with inharmonic overtone spectrum, judging roughness and
separateness as the ability to tell the two tones in each recording apart. 13
sounds were from a Western guitar playing all 13 intervals in one octave, the
other sounds were mainly from non-Western instruments comparing familiar with
unfamiliar instrument sounds for Western listeners. Additionally the sounds
were processed in a cochlear model transferring the mechanical basilar membrane
motion into neural spikes followed by a post-processing simulating different
degrees of coincidence detection. Separateness perception showed a clear
distinction between familiar and unfamiliar sounds, while roughness perception
did not. By correlating perception with simulation different perception
strategies were found. Familiar sounds correlated strongly positive with high
degrees of coincidence detection, where only 3-5 periodicities were left, while
unfamiliar sounds correlated with low coincidence levels. This corresponds to
an attention to pitch and timbre respectively. Additionally, separateness
perception shows an opposite correlation between perception and neural
correlates between familiar and unfamiliar sounds. This correlates with the
perceptional finding of the distinction between familiar and unfamiliar sounds
with separateness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Reinforcement learning for suppression of collective activity in oscillatory ensembles. (arXiv:1909.12154v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12154</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12154</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a use of modern data-based machine learning approaches to suppress
self-sustained collective oscillations typically signaled by ensembles of
degenerative neurons in the brain. The proposed hybrid model relies on two
major components: an environment of oscillators and a policy-based
reinforcement learning block. We report a model-agnostic synchrony control
based on proximal policy optimization and two artificial neural networks in an
Actor-Critic configuration. A class of physically meaningful reward functions
enabling the suppression of collective oscillatory mode is proposed. The
synchrony suppression is demonstrated for two models of neuronal populations --
for the ensembles of globally coupled limit-cycle Bonhoeffer-van der Pol
oscillators and for the bursting Hindmarsh--Rose neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback-guided motor-imagery training (NF-MIT) has been proposed as a promising intervention following upper limb motor impairment. In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Shape of Water Stream Induces Differences in P300 and Alpha Oscillation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Touching is a fundamental human behavior used to evaluate objects in the external world. Many previous studies have used tactile stimulation to conduct psychological and psychophysiological experiments. However, most of these studies used solid material, not water stream, as an experimental stimulus. To investigate water perception, or to easily control the temperature of an experimental stimulus, it is important to be able to control the water stimulus. In this study, we investigated the usability of water as an experimental stimulus for electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and report the basic EEG response to water stimulus. We developed a tactile stimulation device using a water stream to study EEG responses, with the ability to control the stimulus onset timing. As stimuli, we selected two types of water stream, normal and soft, based on a psychological experiment to confirm a difference of subjective feeling induced by these water streams. We conducted a typical oddball task using the two different water streams and recorded EEG waveforms from 64 electrodes while participants touched the water streams. We calculated P300 at the Pz electrode, alpha asymmetry at the frontal electrodes, and alpha suppression at the parietal area. As a result, we observed typical P300 differentiation based on the stimulus proportion (target 20% and standard 80%). We observed a weaker alpha suppression when participants touched the soft water stream compared to the normal shower. These results demonstrate the usability of water stream in psychophysiological studies and suggested that alpha suppression could be a candidate to evaluate comfort of water stream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparing Cyclicity Analysis With Pre-established Functional Connectivity Methods to Identify Individuals and Subject Groups Using Resting State fMRI</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The resting state fMRI time series appears to have cyclic patterns, which indicates presence of cyclic interactions between different brain regions. Such interactions are not easily captured by pre-established resting state functional connectivity methods including zero-lag correlation, lagged correlation, and dynamic time warping distance. These methods formulate the functional interaction between different brain regions as similar temporal patterns within the time series. To use information related to temporal ordering, cyclicity analysis has been introduced to capture pairwise interactions between multiple time series. In this study, we compared the efficacy of cyclicity analysis with aforementioned similarity-based techniques in representing individual-level and group-level information. Additionally, we investigated how filtering and global signal regression interacted with these techniques. We obtained and analyzed fMRI data from patients with tinnitus and neurotypical controls at two different days, a week apart. For both patient and control groups, we found that the features generated by cyclicity and correlation (zero-lag and lagged) analyses were more reliable than the features generated by dynamic time warping distance in identifying individuals across visits. The reliability of all features, except those generated by dynamic time warping, improved as the global signal was regressed. Nevertheless, removing fluctuations &amp;gt;0.1 Hz deteriorated the reliability of all features. These observations underscore the importance of choosing appropriate preprocessing steps while evaluating different analytical methods in describing resting state functional interactivity. Further, using different machine learning techniques including support vector machines, discriminant analyses, and convolutional neural networks, our results revealed that the manifestation of the group-level information within all features was not sufficient enough to dissociate tinnitus patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates further investigation regarding the representation of group-level information within different features to better identify tinnitus-related alternation in the functional organization of the brain. Our study adds to the growing body of research on developing diagnostic tools to identify neurological disorders, such as tinnitus, using resting state fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the clinical and molecular features in patients with ALS4 and mutations in the senataxin (&lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt;) gene, and to develop tools for evaluating &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study involved 32 patients, including 31 with mutation in &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; at c.1166 T&amp;gt;C (p.Leu389Ser) and one with mutation at c.1153 G&amp;gt;A (p.Glu385Lys). Clinical characterization of the patients included neurological examination, blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fibroblasts and motor neurons were obtained to model the disease and characterize the molecular alteration in senataxin function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report key clinical features of ALS4. Laboratory analysis showed alteration of serum creatine kinase and creatinine in the Leu389Ser ALS4 cohort. MRI showed increased muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities which correlates with disease duration (thigh fat fraction R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35, p = 0.01, lower leg fat fraction R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.49, p &amp;lt; 0.01). DEXA measurements showed lower extremities are more affected than the upper extremities (average fat Z‐scores of 2.1 and 0.6, respectively). A cellular assay for SETX function confirmed that like the Leu389Ser mutation, the Glu385Lys variant leads to a gain of senataxin function and thus a decrease in R‐loops.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified clinical laboratory and radiological features of ALS4, and hence they should be monitored for disease progression. The molecular characterization of R‐loop levels in patient‐derived cells provides insight into the disease pathology and assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of candidate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial structure of an evolving population affects the balance of natural selection versus genetic drift. Some structures amplify selection, increasing the role that fitness differences play in determining which mutations become fixed. Other structures suppress selection, reducing the effect of fitness differences and increasing the role of random chance. This phenomenon can be modeled by representing spatial structure as a graph, with individuals occupying vertices. Births and deaths occur stochastically, according to a specified update rule. We study &lt;i&gt;death-Birth&lt;/i&gt; updating: An individual is chosen to die and then its neighbors compete to reproduce into the vacant spot. Previous numerical experiments suggested that amplifiers of selection for this process are either rare or nonexistent. We introduce a perturbative method for this problem for weak selection regime, meaning that mutations have small fitness effects. We show that fixation probability under weak selection can be calculated in terms of the coalescence times of random walks. This result leads naturally to a new definition of effective population size. Using this and other methods, we uncover the first known examples of transient amplifiers of selection (graphs that amplify selection for a particular range of fitness values) for the death-Birth process. We also exhibit new families of “reducers of fixation”, which decrease the fixation probability of all mutations, whether beneficial or deleterious.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VIgN6AScWdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The fixation probability of a single mutant invading a population of residents is among the most widely-studied quantities in evolutionary dynamics. Amplifiers of natural selection are population structures that increase the fixation probability of advantageous mutants, compared to well-mixed populations. Extensive studies have shown that many amplifiers exist for the Birth-death Moran process, some of them substantially increasing the fixation probability or even guaranteeing fixation in the limit of large population size. On the other hand, no amplifiers are known for the death-Birth Moran process, and computer-assisted exhaustive searches have failed to discover amplification. In this work we resolve this disparity, by showing that any amplification under death-Birth updating is necessarily &lt;i&gt;bounded&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;transient&lt;/i&gt;. Our boundedness result states that even if a population structure does amplify selection, the resulting fixation probability is close to that of the well-mixed population. Our transience result states that for any population structure there exists a threshold &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⋆&lt;/sup&gt; such that the population structure ceases to amplify selection if the mutant fitness advantage &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is larger than &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⋆&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, we also extend the above results to &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;-death-Birth updating, which is a combination of Birth-death and death-Birth updating. On the positive side, we identify population structures that maintain amplification for a wide range of values &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;. These results demonstrate that amplification of natural selection depends on the specific mechanisms of the evolutionary process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c0_gkrtm8d4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells contain a thiol redox regulatory network to coordinate metabolic and developmental activities with exogenous and endogenous cues. This network controls the redox state and activity of many target proteins. Electrons are fed into the network from metabolism and reach the target proteins via redox transmitters such as thioredoxin (TRX) and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTR). Electrons are drained from the network by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through thiol peroxidases, e.g., peroxiredoxins (PRX). Mathematical modeling promises access to quantitative understanding of the network function and was implemented by using published kinetic parameters combined with fitting to known biochemical data. Two networks were assembled, namely the ferredoxin (FD), FD-dependent TRX reductase (FTR), TRX, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) pathway with 2-cysteine PRX/ROS as oxidant, and separately the FD, FD-dependent NADP reductase (FNR), NADPH, NTRC-pathway for 2-CysPRX reduction. Combining both modules allowed drawing several important conclusions of network performance. The resting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration was estimated to be about 30 nM in the chloroplast stroma. The electron flow to metabolism exceeds that into thiol regulation of FBPase more than 7000-fold under physiological conditions. The electron flow from NTRC to 2-CysPRX is about 5.32-times more efficient than that from TRX-f1 to 2-CysPRX. Under severe stress (30 μM H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) the ratio of electron flow to the thiol network relative to metabolism sinks to 1:251 whereas the ratio of e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; flow from NTRC to 2-CysPRX and TRX-f1 to 2-CysPRX rises up to 1:67. Thus, the simulation provides clues on experimentally inaccessible parameters and describes the functional state of the chloroplast thiol regulatory network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/je4rA2iFbGs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A new method for inferring timetrees from temporally sampled molecular sequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007046</guid>

Pathogen timetrees are phylogenies scaled to time. They reveal the temporal history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is, temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here, we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches, and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets, we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets, RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD, TreeTime, and treedater), we found that no method performed the best in every scenario. So, we provide a brief guideline for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis. RTDT is implemented for use via a graphical user interface and in high-throughput settings in the newest release of cross-platform MEGA X software, freely available from http://www.megasoftware.net.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pQiuHUzZKK0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Safety and Efficacy of Otaplimastat in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Requiring tPA (SAFE‐TPA): A Multicenter, Randomized, Double‐Blind, Placebo‐Controlled Phase 2 Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otaplimastat is a neuroprotectant that inhibits matrix metalloprotease pathway, and reduces edema and intracerebral hemorrhage induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in animal stroke models. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of otaplimastat in patients receiving rtPA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase 2, 2‐part, multicenter trial in stroke patients (19–80 years old) receiving rtPA. Intravenous otaplimastat was administered &amp;lt;30 minutes after rtPA. Stage 1 was a single‐arm, open‐label safety study in 11 patients. Otaplimastat 80 mg was administered twice daily for 3 days. Stage 2 was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 69 patients, assigned (1:1:1) to otaplimastat 40 mg, otaplimastat 80 mg, or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma (PH) on day 1. Secondary endpoints included serious adverse events (SAEs), mortality, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution at 90 days (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; identifier: NCT02787278).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No safety issues were encountered in stage 1. The incidence of PH during stage 2 was comparable: 0 of 22 with the placebo, 0 of 22 with otaplimastat 40 mg, and 1 of 21 with the 80 mg dose. No differences in SAEs (13%, 17%, 14%) or death (8.3%, 4.2%, 4.8%) were observed among the 3 groups. Three adverse events (chills, muscle rigidity, hepatotoxicity) were judged to be related to otaplimastat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous otaplimastat adjunctive therapy in patients receiving rtPA is feasible and generally safe. The functional efficacy of otaplimastat needs to be investigated with further large trials. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:233–245&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The neurohypophysis (NH), located at the posterior lobe of the pituitary, is a major neuroendocrine tissue, which mediates osmotic balance, blood pressure, reproduction, and lactation by means of releasing the neurohormones oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) from the brain into the peripheral blood circulation. The major cellular components of the NH are hypothalamic axonal termini, fenestrated endothelia and pituicytes, the resident astroglia. However, despite the physiological importance of the NH, the exact molecular signature defining neurohypophyseal cell types and in particular the pituicytes, remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we captured seven distinct cell types in the NH and intermediate lobe (IL) of adult male mouse. We revealed novel pituicyte markers showing higher specificity than previously reported. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that pituicyte is an astrocytic cell type whose transcriptome resembles that of tanycyte. Single molecule &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization revealed spatial organization of the major cell types implying intercellular communications. We present a comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of neurohypophyseal cell types serving as a valuable resource for further functional research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Two-photon fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to probe the structure and functions of cells in living biological tissue. Two-photon excitation generates fluorescence from the focal plane, but also from outside the focal plane, with out-of-focus fluorescence increasing as the focus is pushed deeper into tissue. It has been postulated that the two-photon depth limit, beyond which results become inaccurate, is where in-focus and out-of-focus fluorescence are equal, which we term the balance depth. Calculations suggest that the balance depth should be at ~600 µm in mouse cortex. Neither the two-photon depth limit nor the balance depth have been measured in brain tissue. We found the depth limit and balance depth of two-photon excitation in mice with GCaMP6 indicator expression in all layers of visual cortex, by comparing near-simultaneous two-photon and three-photon excitation. Two-photon and three-photon results from superficial locations were almost identical. two-photon results were inaccurate beyond the balance depth, consistent with the depth limit matching the balance depth for two-photon excitation. However, the two-photon depth limit and balance depth were at 450 µm, shallower than predicted by calculations. Our results were from tissue with a largely homogenous distribution of fluorophores. The expected balance depth is deeper in tissue with fewer fluorophores outside the focal plane and our results therefore establish a superficial bound on the two-photon depth limit in mouse visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The auditory brainstem compares sound-evoked excitation and inhibition from both ears to compute sound source location and determine spatial acuity. Although alterations to the anatomy and physiology of the auditory brainstem have been demonstrated in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) it is not known whether these changes cause spatial acuity deficits in FXS. To test the hypothesis that FXS-related alterations to brainstem circuits impair spatial hearing abilities, a reflexive prepulse inhibition (PPI) task, with variations in sound (gap, location, masking) as the prepulse stimulus, was used on &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice and B6 controls. Specifically, &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; mice show decreased PPI compared to wildtype during gap detection, changes in sound source location, and spatial release from masking with no alteration to their overall startle thresholds compared to wildtype. Lastly, &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; mice have increased latency to respond in these tasks suggesting additional impairments in the pathway responsible for reacting to a startling sound. This study further supports data in humans with FXS that show similar deficits in PPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study to characterize auditory spatial acuity in a mouse model of FXS. We saw minor differences in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; mice compared to B6 mice in several measures of auditory acuity as measured by inhibition of the startle response. &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; mice had increased latency to startle for almost all conditions compared to B6 mice suggesting altered timing to acoustic cues. These experiments further show that, consistent with patient report and anatomical/physiological data, the auditory system is altered in a mouse model of FXS, though with some potential compensation leading to a subtle behavioral impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25680?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the dose‐response relationship of daridorexant, a new dual orexin receptor antagonist, on sleep variables in subjects with insomnia disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults (≤64 years) with insomnia disorder were randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive daily oral placebo, daridorexant (5, 10, 25, or 50 mg), or 10 mg zolpidem for 30 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in wake time after sleep onset from baseline to Days 1&amp;amp;2. Secondary outcome measures were change in latency to persistent sleep from baseline to Days 1&amp;amp;2, change in subjective wake time after sleep onset and subjective latency to sleep onset from baseline to Week 4. Safety was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1005 subjects screened, 359 (64% female) were randomized and received ≥1 dose. A significant dose‐response (Multiple Comparison Procedure‐Modelling, two‐sided p&amp;lt;0.001) was found in the reduction of wake after sleep onset and latency to persistent sleep from baseline to Days 1&amp;amp;2 with daridorexant. These reductions were sustained through to Days 28&amp;amp;29 (p=0.050 and p=0.042, respectively). Similar dose‐dependent relationships were observed for subjective wake after sleep onset and subjective latency to sleep onset. The incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events was 35%, 38%, 38%, and 34% in subjects treated with 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg daridorexant, respectively, compared with 30% for placebo, and 40% for 10 mg zolpidem. There were no clinically‐relevant treatment‐related serious adverse events. Four subjects withdrew due to adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daridorexant induced a dose‐dependent reduction in wake time after sleep onset in subjects with insomnia disorder. &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; (NCT02839200)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non‐motor symptoms, reduced striatal dopamine signaling and loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. It is now known that the pathological process in Parkinson's disease may begin decades before the clinical diagnosis and include a variety of neuronal alterations in addition to the dopamine system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study examined the density of all synapses with synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) in Parkinson's disease subjects with mild bilateral disease (N=12) and matched normal controls (N=12) using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; high‐resolution PET imaging as well as &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; autoradiography in an independent sample with Parkinson's disease (N=15) and normal controls (N=13) in the substantia nigra and putamen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group‐by‐brain region interaction effect (F&lt;sub&gt;10,22&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.52, p = 0.007) was observed in the primary brain areas with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; SV2A binding. Post hoc analyses revealed that Parkinson's disease group exhibited lower SV2A in the substantia nigra (‐45%; p &amp;lt; 0.001), red nucleus (‐31%; p = 0.03) and locus coeruleus (‐17%; p = 0.03). Exploratory analyses also revealed lower SV2A binding in clinically relevant cortical areas. Using autoradiography, we confirmed lower SV2A in the substantia nigra (‐17%; p &amp;lt; 0.005) and nonsignificant findings in the putamen (‐4%; p = 0.06).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides the first evidence of synaptic loss in brainstem nuclei involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in living patients. SV2A imaging holds promise for understanding synaptic changes central to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory dysfunction is a common consequence of many forms of neurological injury, including stroke and nerve damage. Rehabilitative paradigms that incorporate sensory retraining can provide modest benefits, but the majority of patients are left with lasting sensory loss. We have developed a novel strategy that uses closed‐loop vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with tactile rehabilitation to enhance synaptic plasticity and facilitate recovery of sensory function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical case report provides initial evidence that a similar implementation of closed‐loop VNS paired with a tactile rehabilitation regimen could improve recovery of somatosensory function. Here, we sought to build on these promising initial clinical data and rigorously evaluate the ability of VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation to improve recovery in an animal model of chronic sensory loss. The study design, including planned sample size, assessments, and statistical comparisons, was preregistered prior to beginning data collection (&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/xsnj5/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://osf.io/xsnj5/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation resulted in a significant and nearly complete recovery of mechanosensory withdrawal thresholds. Equivalent tactile rehabilitation without VNS failed to improve sensory function. This VNS‐dependent restoration of sensory thresholds was maintained for several months after the cessation of stimulation, illustrating long‐term benefits. Moreover, VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation resulted in significant generalized improvements in other measures of sensorimotor forepaw function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the safety and tolerability of VNS therapy, these findings suggest that incorporating VNS paired with sensory retraining into rehabilitative regimens may represent a fundamentally new method to increase recovery of sensory function after neurological injury.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05847</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a pixel-based deep Active Inference algorithm (PixelAI) inspired
in human body perception and successfully validated in robot body perception
and action as a use case. Our algorithm combines the free energy principle from
neuroscience, rooted in variational inference, with deep convolutional decoders
to scale the algorithm to directly deal with images input and provide online
adaptive inference. The approach enables the robot to perform 1) dynamical body
estimation of arm using only raw monocular camera images and 2) autonomous
reaching to &quot;imagined&quot; arm poses in the visual space. We statistically analyzed
the algorithm performance in a simulated and a real Nao robot. Results show how
the same algorithm deals with both perception an action, modelled as an
inference optimization problem.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Hopf Bifurcation in Mean Field Explains Critical Avalanches in Excitation-Inhibition Balanced Neuronal Networks: A Mechanism for Multiscale Variability. (arXiv:2001.05626v2 [cond-mat.dis-nn] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05626</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05626</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical neural circuits display highly irregular spiking in individual
neurons but variably sized collective firing, oscillations and critical
avalanches at the population level, all of which have functional importance for
information processing. Theoretically, the balance of excitation and inhibition
inputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches
may originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical
reconciliation of these multilevel dynamic aspects remains an open question.
Herein, we show that excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced network with synaptic
kinetics can maintain irregular spiking dynamics with different levels of
synchrony and critical avalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point.
The mechanism is unveiled by a novel mean-field theory that derives the field
equations governing the network macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I
balanced state of the network manifesting irregular individual spiking is
characterized by a macroscopic stable state, which can be either a fixed point
or a periodic motion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in
the macroscopic field. Furthermore, these multiscale variable behaviours can be
jointly observed in the spontaneous activities of mouse cortical slice in
vitro, indicating universality of the theoretical prediction. Our theory
unveils the mechanism that permits complex neural activities in different
spatiotemporal scales to coexist and elucidates a possible origin of the
criticality of neural systems. It also provides a theoretical framework for
analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of E-I balanced networks and its
relationship to the microscopic counterparts, which can be useful for
large-scale modeling and computation of cortical dynamics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor failure is the leading cause of death in spinal cord injury (SCI). Cervical injuries disrupt connections between brainstem neurons that are the primary source of excitatory drive to respiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord and their targets. In addition to direct connections from bulbospinal neurons, respiratory motor neurons also receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from propriospinal neurons, yet their role in the control of breathing is often overlooked. In this review, we will present evidence that propriospinal neurons play important roles in patterning muscle activity for breathing. These roles likely include shaping the pattern of respiratory motor output, processing and transmitting sensory afferent information, coordinating ventilation with motor activity, and regulating accessory and respiratory muscle activity. In addition, we discuss recent studies that have highlighted the importance of propriospinal neurons for recovery of respiratory muscle function following SCI. We propose that molecular genetic approaches to target specific developmental neuron classes in the spinal cord would help investigators resolve the many roles of propriospinal neurons in the control of breathing. A better understanding of how spinal circuits pattern breathing could lead to new treatments to improve breathing following injury or disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Feedback Modulates Audio-Visual Spatial Recalibration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00074</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00074</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In an ever-changing environment, crossmodal recalibration is crucial to maintain precise and coherent spatial estimates across different sensory modalities. Accordingly, it has been found that perceived auditory space is recalibrated toward vision after consistent exposure to spatially misaligned audio-visual stimuli (VS). While this so-called ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) yields internal consistency between vision and audition, it does not necessarily lead to consistency between the perceptual representation of space and the actual environment. For this purpose, feedback about the true state of the external world might be necessary. Here, we tested whether the size of the VAE is modulated by external feedback and reward. During adaptation audio-VS with a fixed spatial discrepancy were presented. Participants had to localize the sound and received feedback about the magnitude of their localization error. In half of the sessions the feedback was based on the position of the VS and in the other half it was based on the position of the auditory stimulus. An additional monetary reward was given if the localization error fell below a certain threshold that was based on participants’ performance in the pretest. As expected, when error feedback was based on the position of the VS, auditory localization during adaptation trials shifted toward the position of the VS. Conversely, feedback based on the position of the auditory stimuli reduced the visual influence on auditory localization (i.e., the ventriloquism effect) and improved sound localization accuracy. After adaptation with error feedback based on the VS position, a typical auditory VAE (but no visual aftereffect) was observed in subsequent unimodal localization tests. By contrast, when feedback was based on the position of the auditory stimuli during adaptation, no auditory VAE was observed in subsequent unimodal auditory trials. Importantly, in this situation no visual aftereffect was found either. As feedback did not change the physical attributes of the audio-visual stimulation during adaptation, the present findings suggest that crossmodal recalibration is subject to top–down influences. Such top–down influences might help prevent miscalibration of audition toward conflicting visual stimulation in situations in which external feedback indicates that visual information is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Differential tDCS and tACS Effects on Working Memory-Related Neural Activity and Resting-State Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01440</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS and tACS, respectively) entail capability to modulate human brain dynamics and cognition. However, the comparability of these approaches at the level of large-scale functional networks has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, 44 subjects were randomly assigned to receive sham (N = 15), tDCS (N = 15), or tACS (N = 14). The first electrode (anode in tDCS) was positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the target area, and the second electrode (cathode in tDCS) was placed over the right supraorbital region. tDCS was delivered with a constant current of 2 mA. tACS was fixed to 2 mA peak-to-peak with 6 Hz frequency. Stimulation was applied concurrently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, both at rest and during the performance of a verbal working memory (WM) task. After stimulation, subjects repeated the fMRI WM task. Our results indicated that at rest, tDCS increased functional connectivity particularly within the default-mode network (DMN), while tACS decreased it. When comparing both fMRI WM tasks, it was observed that tDCS displayed decreased brain activity post-stimulation as compared to online. Conversely, tACS effects were driven by neural increases online as compared to post-stimulation. Interestingly, both effects primarily occurred within DMN-related areas. Regarding the differences in each fMRI WM task, during the online fMRI WM task, tACS engaged distributed neural resources which did not overlap with the WM-dependent activity pattern, but with some posterior DMN regions. In contrast, during the post-stimulation fMRI WM task, tDCS strengthened prefrontal DMN deactivations, being these activity reductions associated with faster responses. Furthermore, it was observed that tDCS neural responses presented certain consistency across distinct fMRI modalities, while tACS did not. In sum, tDCS and tACS modulate fMRI-derived network dynamics differently. However, both effects seem to focus on DMN regions and the WM network-DMN shift, which are highly affected in aging and disease. Thus, albeit exploratory and needing further replication with larger samples, our results might provide a refined understanding of how the DMN functioning can be externally modulated through commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which may be of eventual clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)-constructed functional network (FN) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can effectively mine alterations in brain function during aging due to the non-invasive and effective advantages of fMRI. With global health research focusing on aging, several open fMRI datasets have been made available that combine deep learning with big data and are a new, promising trend and open issue for brain information detection in fMRI studies of brain aging. In this study, we proposed a new method based on deep learning from the perspective of big data, named Deep neural network (DNN) with Autoencoder (AE) pretrained Functional connectivity Analysis (DAFA), to deeply mine the important functional connectivity changes in fMRI during brain aging. First, using resting-state fMRI data from 421 subjects from the CamCAN dataset, functional connectivities were calculated using sliding window method, and the complex functional patterns were mined by an AE. Then, to increase the statistical power and reliability of the results, we used an AE-pretrained DNN to relabel the functional connectivities of each subject to classify them as belonging to the attributes of young or old individuals. A method called search-back analysis was performed to find alterations in brain function during aging according to the relabeled functional connectivities. Finally, behavioral data regarding fluid intelligence and response time were used to verify the revealed functional changes. Compared to traditional methods, DAFA revealed additional, important aged-related changes in FC patterns [e.g., FC connections within the default mode (DMN) and the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as connections between the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks, between the DMN and the frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular/sensorimotor/occipital/cerebellum networks, and between the sensorimotor and frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular networks], which were correlated to behavioral data. These findings demonstrated that the proposed DAFA method was superior to traditional FC-determining methods in discovering changes in brain functional connectivity during aging. In addition, it may be a promising method for exploring important information in other fMRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading type of dementia worldwide. Despite an increasing burden of disease due to a rapidly aging population, there is still a lack of complete understanding of the precise pathological mechanisms which drive its progression. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an essential role in the normal function and excitability of neuronal networks. While previous studies have shown alterations in the function of the glutamatergic system in AD, the underlying etiology of beta amyloid (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;) induced changes has not been explored. Here we have investigated the acute effects of stereotaxic hippocampal Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; injection on specific glutamatergic receptors and transporters in the mouse hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy 3 days after Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; injection in aged male C57BL/6 mice, before the onset of neuronal cell death. We show that acute injection of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; is sufficient to induce cognitive deficits 3 days post-injection. We also report no significant changes in glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, VGluT1, and VGluT2 in response to acute injection of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; when compared with the ACSF-vehicle injected mice. However, we observed increased expression in the DG hilus and ventral stratum (str.) granulosum, CA3 str. radiatum and str. oriens, and CA1 str. radiatum of the GluN1 subunit, and increased expression within the CA3 str. radiatum and decreased expression within the DG str. granulosum of the GluN2A subunit in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; injected mice compared to NC, and a similar trend observed when compared to ACSF-injected mice. We also observed alterations in expression patterns of glutamatergic receptor subunits and transporters within specific layers of hippocampal subregions in response to a microinjection stimulus. These findings indicate that the pathological alterations in the glutamatergic system observed in AD are likely to be partially a result of both acute and chronic exposure to Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and implies a much more complex circuit mechanism associated with glutamatergic dysfunction than simply glutamate-mediated excitotoxic neuronal death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Emotion Measurements Through the Touch of Materials Surfaces</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The emotion generated by the touch of materials is studied via a protocol based on blind assessment of various stimuli. The human emotional reaction felt toward a material is estimated through (i) explicit measurements, using a questionnaire collecting valence and intensity, and (ii) implicit measurements of the activity of the autonomic nervous system, via a pupillometry equipment. A panel of 25 university students (13 women, 12 men), aged from 18 to 27, tested blind twelve materials such as polymers, sandpapers, wood, velvet and fur, randomly ordered. After measuring the initial pupil diameter, taken as a reference, its variation during the tactile exploration was recorded. After each touch, the participants were asked to quantify the emotional value of the material. The results show that the pupil size variation follows the emotional intensity. It is significantly larger during the touch of materials considered as pleasant or unpleasant, than with the touch of neutral materials. Moreover, after a time period of about 0.5 s following the stimulus, the results reveal significant differences between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, as well as differences according to gender, i.e., higher pupil dilatation of women than men. These results suggest (i) that the autonomic nervous system is initially sensitive to high arousing stimulation, and (ii) that, after a certain period, the pupil size changes according to the cognitive interest induced and the emotional regulation adopted. This research shows the interest of the emotional characterization of materials for product design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Unsupervised Learning of Persistent and Sequential Activity</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00097</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two strikingly distinct types of activity have been observed in various brain structures during delay periods of delayed response tasks: Persistent activity (PA), in which a sub-population of neurons maintains an elevated firing rate throughout an entire delay period; and Sequential activity (SA), in which sub-populations of neurons are activated sequentially in time. It has been hypothesized that both types of dynamics can be “learned” by the relevant networks from the statistics of their inputs, thanks to mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. However, the necessary conditions for a synaptic plasticity rule and input statistics to learn these two types of dynamics in a stable fashion are still unclear. In particular, it is unclear whether a single learning rule is able to learn both types of activity patterns, depending on the statistics of the inputs driving the network. Here, we first characterize the complete bifurcation diagram of a firing rate model of multiple excitatory populations with an inhibitory mechanism, as a function of the parameters characterizing its connectivity. We then investigate how an unsupervised temporally asymmetric Hebbian plasticity rule shapes the dynamics of the network. Consistent with previous studies, we find that for stable learning of PA and SA, an additional stabilization mechanism is necessary. We show that a generalized version of the standard multiplicative homeostatic plasticity (Renart et al., 2003; Toyoizumi et al., 2014) stabilizes learning by effectively masking excitatory connections during stimulation and unmasking those connections during retrieval. Using the bifurcation diagram derived for fixed connectivity, we study analytically the temporal evolution and the steady state of the learned recurrent architecture as a function of parameters characterizing the external inputs. Slow changing stimuli lead to PA, while fast changing stimuli lead to SA. Our network model shows how a network with plastic synapses can stably and flexibly learn PA and SA in an unsupervised manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evaluation of Resting Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of a Neural Mass Model Using Resting fMRI Connectivity and EEG Microstates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state brain activities have been extensively investigated to understand the macro-scale network architecture of the human brain using non-invasive imaging methods such as fMRI, EEG, and MEG. Previous studies revealed a mechanistic origin of resting-state networks (RSNs) using the connectome dynamics modeling approach, where the neural mass dynamics model constrained by the structural connectivity is simulated to replicate the resting-state networks measured with fMRI and/or fast synchronization transitions with EEG/MEG. However, there is still little understanding of the relationship between the slow fluctuations measured with fMRI and the fast synchronization transitions with EEG/MEG. In this study, as a first step toward evaluating experimental evidence of resting state activity at two different time scales but in a unified way, we investigate connectome dynamics models that simultaneously explain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and EEG microstates. Here, we introduce empirical rsFC and microstates as evaluation criteria of simulated neuronal dynamics obtained by the Larter-Breakspear model in one cortical region connected with those in other cortical regions based on structural connectivity. We optimized the global coupling strength and the local gain parameter (variance of the excitatory and inhibitory threshold) of the simulated neuronal dynamics by fitting both rsFC and microstate spatial patterns to those of experimental ones. As a result, we found that simulated neuronal dynamics in a narrow optimal parameter range simultaneously reproduced empirical rsFC and microstates. Two parameter groups had different inter-regional interdependence. One type of dynamics was synchronized across the whole brain region, and the other type was synchronized between brain regions with strong structural connectivity. In other words, both fast synchronization transitions and slow BOLD fluctuation changed based on structural connectivity in the two parameter groups. Empirical microstates were similar to simulated microstates in the two parameter groups. Thus, fast synchronization transitions correlated with slow BOLD fluctuation based on structural connectivity yielded characteristics of microstates. Our results demonstrate that a bottom-up approach, which extends the single neuronal dynamics model based on empirical observations into a neural mass dynamics model and integrates structural connectivity, effectively reveals both macroscopic fast, and slow resting-state network dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Network Models Predict That Pyramidal Neuron Hyperexcitability and Synapse Loss in the dlPFC Lead to Age-Related Spatial Working Memory Impairment in Rhesus Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00089</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies have shown spatial working memory impairment with aging in several animal species, including humans. Persistent activity of layer 3 pyramidal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) neurons during delay periods of working memory tasks is important for encoding memory of the stimulus. In vitro studies have shown that these neurons undergo significant age-related structural and functional changes, but the extent to which these changes affect neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory is not understood fully. Here, we confirm previous studies showing impairment on the Delayed Recognition Span Task in the spatial condition (DRSTsp), and increased in vitro action potential firing rates (hyperexcitability), across the adult life span of the rhesus monkey. We use a bump attractor model to predict how empirically observed changes in the aging dlPFC affect performance on the Delayed Response Task (DRT), and introduce a model of memory retention in the DRSTsp. Persistent activity—and, in turn, cognitive performance—in both models was affected much more by hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons than by a loss of synapses. Our DRT simulations predict that additional changes to the network, such as increased firing of inhibitory interneurons, are needed to account for lower firing rates during the DRT with aging reported in vivo. Synaptic facilitation was an essential feature of the DRSTsp model, but it did not compensate fully for the effects of the other age-related changes on DRT performance. Modeling pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability and synapse loss simultaneously led to a partial recovery of function in both tasks, with the simulated level of DRSTsp impairment similar to that observed in aging monkeys. This modeling work integrates empirical data across multiple scales, from synapse counts to cognitive testing, to further our understanding of aging in non-human primates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Altered Levels and Isoforms of Tau and Nuclear Membrane Invaginations in Huntington’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00574</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the early reports of neurofibrillary Tau pathology in brains of some Huntington’s disease (HD) patients, mounting evidence of multiple alterations of Tau in HD brain tissue has emerged in recent years. Such Tau alterations range from increased total levels, imbalance of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (increased 4R-/3R-Tau ratio) or by post-translational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation or truncation. Besides, the detection in HD brains of a new Tau histopathological hallmark known as Tau nuclear rods (TNRs) or Tau-positive nuclear indentations (TNIs) led to propose HD as a secondary Tauopathy. After their discovery in HD brains, TNIs have also been reported in hippocampal neurons of early Braak stage AD cases and in frontal and temporal cortical neurons of FTD-MAPT cases due to the intronic IVS10+16 mutation in the Tau gene (MAPT) which results in an increased 4R-/3R-Tau ratio similar to that observed in HD. TNIs are likely pathogenic for contributing to the disturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport observed in HD. A key question is whether correction of any of the mentioned Tau alterations might have positive therapeutic implications for HD. The beneficial effect of decreasing Tau expression in HD mouse models clearly implicates Tau in HD pathogenesis. Such beneficial effect might be exerted by diminishing the excess total levels of Tau or specifically by diminishing the excess 4R-Tau, as well as any of their downstream effects. In any case, since gene silencing drugs are under development to attenuate both Huntingtin (HTT) expression for HD and MAPT expression for FTD-MAPT, it is conceivable that the combined therapy in HD patients might be more effective than HTT silencing alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most frequently occurring movement disorder, with an increasing incidence due to an aging population. For many years, the post-mortem brain was regarded as the gold standard for the analysis of the human pathology of this disease. However, modern stem cell technologies, including the analysis of patient-specific neurons and glial cells, have opened up new avenues for dissecting the pathologic mechanisms of PD. Most data on morphological changes, such as cell death or changes in neurite complexity, or functional deficits were acquired in 2D and few in 3D models. This review will examine the prerequisites for human disease modeling in PD, covering the generation of midbrain neurons, 3D organoid midbrain models, the selection of controls including genetically engineered lines, and the study of cell-cell interactions. We will present major disease phenotypes in human in vitro models of PD, focusing on those phenotypes that have been detected in genetic and sporadic PD models. An additional point covered in this review will be the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived technologies to model cell-cell interactions in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: CaV1.3 L-Type Calcium Channels Increase the Vulnerability of Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons in MPTP Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) over those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain poorly understood. DA neurons of SNpc and VTA are autonomous pacemakers but pacemaking in SNpc but not in VTA is accompanied by calcium influx through L-type calcium channel, Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 contributing to increased intracellular calcium and hence to cell death. Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt;, an alternatively spliced short variant of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 has increased calcium influx. We, therefore studied the role of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (full-length channel) and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; in mouse SNpc in PD pathogenesis by quantifying mRNA levels of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; in SNpc and followed the change in their levels in MPTP induced parkinsonism mouse model. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we observed the localization of mRNA of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive DA neurons. Further, mRNA levels of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; were higher in SNpc as compared to the cortex. Upon MPTP treatment, mRNA levels of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; maintained their levels in SNpc in spite of the loss of ~50% of the DA neurons. This indicates that the expression of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; is maintained at a robust level during the degenerative process in the parkinsonism model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;miR-146a is a microRNA (miRNA) involved in neuroinflammation and aging; alterations in its expression were described in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, most of the studies conducted so far on this miRNA included a limited number of participants and produced contradictory results. We compared miR-146a levels in plasma from 33 AD patients vs. 28 age-matched non-affected controls (CTRL) through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). No difference between the case and the control group was evidenced, but a correlation was detected between miR-146a levels and subjects’ age (p &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as between miR-146a levels and patients’ Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p = 0.011), in an enlarged group of 51 AD patients and 45 CTRL supporting a role for this miRNA in aging processes and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since its origins, thousands of years ago, agriculture has been challenged by the presence of evolving plant pathogens. Temporal rotations of host and non-host crops have helped farmers to control epidemics among other utilities, but further efforts for strategy assessment are needed. Here, we present a methodology for developing crop rotation strategies optimal for control of pathogens informed by numerical simulations of eco-evolutionary dynamics in one field. This approach can integrate agronomic criteria used in crop rotations—soil quality and cash yield—and the analysis of pathogen evolution in systems where hosts are artificially selected. Our analysis shows which rotation patterns perform better in maximising crop yield when an unspecified infection occurs, with yield being dependent on both soil quality and the strength of the epidemic. Importantly, the use of non-host crops, which both improve soil quality and control the epidemic results in similar rational rotation strategies for diverse agronomic and infection conditions. We test the repeatability of the best rotation patterns over multiple decades, an essential end-user goal. Our results provide sustainable strategies for optimal resource investment for increased food production and lead to further insights into the minimisation of pesticide use in a society demanding ever more efficient agriculture.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Rt757zAX7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Humans and other animals adapt motor commands to predictable disturbances within tens of trials in laboratory conditions. A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a force field prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; An important function of the nervous system is to adapt motor commands in anticipation of predictable disturbances, which supports motor learning when we move in novel environments such as force fields. Here we show that movement control when exposed to unpredictable disturbances exhibit similar traits: motor corrections become tuned to the force field, and they evoke after effects within an ongoing sequence of movements. We propose and discuss the framework of adaptive control to explain these results: a real-time learning algorithm, which complements feedback control in the presence of model errors. This candidate model potentially links movement control and trial-by-trial adaptation of motor commands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by the rapid appearance and disappearance of local skin edema and flares with itching. It is characterized by various macroscopic skin eruptions unique to patients and/or subtypes of urticaria with respect to shape, size, color, and/or duration of eruptions. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying multifarious eruptions in urticaria is largely unknown. The eruptions are believed to be evoked by histamine release from mast cells in the skin. However, the majority of visible characteristics of urticaria cannot be explained by a simple injection of histamine to the skin. To explain the multifarious eruptions of urticaria, we developed a single reaction-diffusion model suggesting the self-activation and self-inhibition regulation of histamine release from mast cells. Using the model, we found that various geometrical shapes of eruptions typically observed in patients can be explained by the model parameters and randomness or strength of the initial stimuli to mast cells. Furthermore, we verified that the wheal-expanding speed of urticaria, which is shown to be much smaller than that of the intradermal injection experimental system may be explained by our model and a simple diffusion equation. Our study suggests that the simple reaction-diffusion dynamics, including the independent self-activating and -inhibitory regulation of histamine release, may account for the essential mechanism underlying the formation of multifarious eruptions in urticaria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/agkwHgohOw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Advanced brain imaging analysis methods, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), functional connectivity, and functional alignment, have become powerful tools in cognitive neuroscience over the past decade. These tools are implemented in custom code and separate packages, often requiring different software and language proficiencies. Although usable by expert researchers, novice users face a steep learning curve. These difficulties stem from the use of new programming languages (e.g., Python), learning how to apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional fMRI data, and minimal documentation and training materials. Furthermore, most standard fMRI analysis packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, SPM) focus on preprocessing and univariate analyses, leaving a gap in how to integrate with advanced tools. To address these needs, we developed BrainIAK (brainiak.org), an open-source Python software package that seamlessly integrates several cutting-edge, computationally efficient techniques with other Python packages (e.g., Nilearn, Scikit-learn) for file handling, visualization, and machine learning. To disseminate these powerful tools, we developed user-friendly tutorials (in Jupyter format; https://brainiak.org/tutorials/) for learning BrainIAK and advanced fMRI analysis in Python more generally. These materials cover techniques including: MVPA (pattern classification and representational similarity analysis); parallelized searchlight analysis; background connectivity; full correlation matrix analysis; inter-subject correlation; inter-subject functional connectivity; shared response modeling; event segmentation using hidden Markov models; and real-time fMRI. For long-running jobs or large memory needs we provide detailed guidance on high-performance computing clusters. These notebooks were successfully tested at multiple sites, including as problem sets for courses at Yale and Princeton universities and at various workshops and hackathons. These materials are freely shared, with the hope that they become part of a pool of open-source software and educational materials for large-scale, reproducible fMRI analysis and accelerated discovery.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oLWKbgzX3Gk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Environmental factors interact with internal rules of population regulation, sometimes perturbing systems to alternate dynamics though changes in parameter values. Yet, pinpointing when such changes occur in naturally fluctuating populations is difficult. An algorithmic approach that can identify the timing and magnitude of parameter shifts would facilitate understanding of abrupt ecological transitions with potential to inform conservation and management of species. The “Dynamic Shift Detector” is an algorithm to identify changes in parameter values governing temporal fluctuations in populations with nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm examines population time series data for the presence, location, and magnitude of parameter shifts. It uses an iterative approach to fitting subsets of time series data, then ranks the fit of break point combinations using model selection, assigning a relative weight to each break. We examined the performance of the Dynamic Shift Detector with simulations and two case studies. Under low environmental/sampling noise, the break point sets selected by the Dynamic Shift Detector contained the true simulated breaks with 70–100% accuracy. The weighting tool generally assigned breaks intentionally placed in simulated data (i.e., true breaks) with weights averaging &amp;gt;0.8 and those due to sampling error (i.e., erroneous breaks) with weights averaging &amp;lt;0.2. In our case study examining an invasion process, the algorithm identified shifts in population cycling associated with variations in resource availability. The shifts identified for the conservation case study highlight a decline process that generally coincided with changing management practices affecting the availability of hostplant resources. When interpreted in the context of species biology, the Dynamic Shift Detector algorithm can aid management decisions and identify critical time periods related to species’ dynamics. In an era of rapid global change, such tools can provide key insights into the conditions under which population parameters, and their corresponding dynamics, can shift.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pv4TenRPku0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Evaluating the Burstlet Theory of Inspiratory Rhythm and Pattern Generation</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) generates the rhythm and rudimentary motor pattern for inspiratory breathing movements. Here, we test &quot;burstlet&quot; theory (Kam et al., 2013a), which posits that low amplitude burstlets, subthreshold from the standpoint of inspiratory bursts, reflect the fundamental oscillator of the preBötC. In turn, a discrete suprathreshold process transforms burstlets into full amplitude inspiratory bursts that drive motor output, measurable via hypoglossal nerve (XII) discharge &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recap observations by Kam and Feldman in neonatal mouse slice preparations: field recordings from preBötC demonstrate bursts and concurrent XII motor output intermingled with lower amplitude burstlets that do not produce XII motor output. Manipulations of excitability affect the relative prevalence of bursts and burstlets and modulate their frequency. Whole-cell and photonic recordings of preBötC neurons suggest that burstlets involve inconstant subsets of rhythmogenic interneurons. We conclude that discrete rhythm- and pattern-generating mechanisms coexist in the preBötC and that burstlets reflect its fundamental rhythmogenic nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Predicted Position Error Triggers Catch-Up Saccades during Sustained Smooth Pursuit</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;For humans, visual tracking of moving stimuli often triggers catch-up saccades during smooth pursuit. The switch between these continuous and discrete eye movements is a trade-off between tolerating sustained position error (PE) when no saccade is triggered or a transient loss of vision during the saccade due to saccadic suppression. de Brouwer et al. (2002b) demonstrated that catch-up saccades were less likely to occur when the target re-crosses the fovea within 40–180 ms. To date, there is no mechanistic explanation for how the trigger decision is made by the brain. Recently, we proposed a stochastic decision model for saccade triggering during visual tracking (Coutinho et al., 2018) that relies on a probabilistic estimate of predicted PE (PE&lt;sub&gt;pred&lt;/sub&gt;). Informed by model predictions, we hypothesized that saccade trigger time length and variability will increase when pre-saccadic predicted errors are small or visual uncertainty is high (e.g., for blurred targets). Data collected from human participants performing a double step-ramp task showed that large pre-saccadic PE&lt;sub&gt;pred&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;10°) produced short saccade trigger times regardless of the level of uncertainty while saccade trigger times preceded by small PE&lt;sub&gt;pred&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;lt;10°) significantly increased in length and variability, and more so for blurred targets. Our model also predicted increased signal-dependent noise (SDN) as retinal slip (RS) increases; in our data, this resulted in longer saccade trigger times and more smooth trials without saccades. In summary, our data supports our hypothesized predicted error-based decision process for coordinating saccades during smooth pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SIRT3 Haploinsufficiency Aggravates Loss of GABAergic Interneurons and Neuronal Network Hyperexcitability in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/3/694?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Impaired mitochondrial function and aberrant neuronal network activity are believed to be early events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how mitochondrial alterations contribute to aberrant activity in neuronal circuits is unknown. In this study, we examined the function of mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the pathogenesis of AD. Compared with AppPs1 mice, Sirt3-haploinsufficient AppPs1 mice (Sirt3&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;AppPs1) exhibit early epileptiform EEG activity and seizure. Both male and female Sirt3&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;AppPs1 mice were observed to die prematurely before 5 months of age. When comparing male mice among different genotypes, Sirt3 haploinsufficiency renders GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex vulnerable to degeneration and associated neuronal network hyperexcitability. Feeding Sirt3&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;AppPs1 AD mice with a ketone ester-rich diet increases SIRT3 expression and prevents seizure-related death and the degeneration of GABAergic neurons, indicating that the aggravated GABAergic neuron loss and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Sirt3&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;AppPs1 mice are caused by SIRT3 reduction and can be rescued by increase of SIRT3 expression. Consistent with a protective role in AD, SIRT3 levels are reduced in association with cerebral cortical Aβ pathology in AD patients. In summary, SIRT3 preserves GABAergic interneurons and protects cerebral circuits against hyperexcitability, and this neuroprotective mechanism can be bolstered by dietary ketone esters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABAergic neurons provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. By preserving mitochondrial function, SIRT3 protects parvalbumin and calretinin interneurons against Aβ-associated dysfunction and degeneration in AppPs1 Alzheimer's disease mice, thus restraining neuronal network hyperactivity. The neuronal network dysfunction that occurs in Alzheimer's disease can be partially reversed by physiological, dietary, and pharmacological interventions to increase SIRT3 expression and enhance the functionality of GABAergic interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Hsc70 Ameliorates the Vesicle Recycling Defects Caused by Excess {alpha}-Synuclein at Synapses</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein overexpression and aggregation are linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and several other neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to effects in the cell body, α-synuclein accumulation occurs at presynapses where the protein is normally localized. While it is generally agreed that excess α-synuclein impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We show here that acute introduction of excess human α-synuclein at a classic vertebrate synapse, the lamprey reticulospinal synapse, selectively impaired the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during synaptic vesicle recycling, leading to an increase in endocytic intermediates and a severe depletion of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, human α-synuclein and lamprey -synuclein both interact &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with Hsc70, the chaperone protein that uncoats CCVs at synapses. After introducing excess α-synuclein to the giant axons of lampreys (males and females), Hsc70 availability was reduced at stimulated synapses, suggesting Hsc70 sequestration as a possible mechanism underlying the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects. In support of this hypothesis, increasing the levels of exogenous Hsc70 along with α-synuclein ameliorated the CCV uncoating and vesicle recycling defects. These experiments identify a reduction in Hsc70 availability at synapses, and consequently its function, as the mechanism by which α-synuclein induces synaptic vesicle recycling defects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a viable chaperone-based strategy for reversing the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects associated with excess α-synuclein, which may be of value for improving synaptic function in PD and other synuclein-linked diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic defects caused by α-synuclein overexpression are linked to cognitive deficits in PD and other diseases. However, the mechanisms by which excess α-synuclein impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking are unknown. Data presented here demonstrate that acute introduction of excess α-synuclein at a classical vertebrate synapse inhibits CCV uncoating, leading to impaired vesicle recycling. Furthermore, increasing α-synuclein also reduced synaptic levels of Hsc70, the clathrin uncoating chaperone protein, indicating sequestration of Hsc70 as a possible underlying mechanism. Subsequently increasing exogenous Hsc70 restored CCV uncoating and vesicle recycling. This study identifies a novel molecular mechanism underlying the α-synuclein-induced synaptic defects and presents one viable strategy for reversing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Optogenetic activation of {beta}-endorphin terminals in the medial preoptic nucleus regulates sexual receptivity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Estrogen and progesterone act in neural circuits to elicit lordosis, the stereotypical female sexual receptivity behavior. Estradiol acts through membrane receptors to rapidly activate a limbic-hypothalamic circuit consisting of the arcuate (ARH), medial preoptic (MPN), and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. This initial activation results in a transient but necessary inhibition of lordosis, which appears to be a result of the release of beta-endorphin (β-End) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) terminals onto cells containing the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the MPN. To functionally examine the role of the MOR in the hypothalamic lordosis circuit, we transfected a channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus into POMC cell bodies in the ARH and photostimulated POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive female Pomc-cre mice. Following estrogen and progesterone priming, sexual receptivity was assessed by measuring the lordosis quotient. Following an initial trial for sexual receptivity, mice were photostimulated during behavioral testing, and brains were processed for MOR immunohistochemistry. Photostimulation decreased the lordosis quotient only in ChR2-expressing Pomc-cre mice. Furthermore, photostimulation of ChR2 in POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN resulted in the internalization of MOR, indicating activation of the receptor. Our results suggest that the activation of the MOR in the MPN is sufficient to attenuate lordosis behavior in a hormone-primed, sexually receptive female mouse. These data support a central role of MOR in female sexual behavior, and provide further insight into the hypothalamus control of sexual receptivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The µ-opioid receptor (MOR) has been shown to modify lordosis, the female sexual receptivity behavior. Estrogen and progesterone facilitate lordosis, though the initial effects of estradiol in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) inhibit the behavior through MOR activity in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN). The present study uses optogenetics to directly stimulate proopiomelanocortin/beta-endorphin axonal terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive female mice to examine the effects of MOR activity on lordosis. Photostimulation of these terminals is sufficient to activate and internalize the MOR, and to attenuate lordosis behavior in otherwise sexually receptive mice. Our results provide further evidence of an ARH to MPN projection that, by activating MOR, is inhibitory to lordosis behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: TrkB signaling influences gene expression in cortistatin-expressing interneurons</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its cognate receptor tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB) to promote the function of several classes of inhibitory interneurons. We previously reported that loss of BDNF-TrkB signaling in cortistatin-expressing (Cort) interneurons leads to behavioral hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures in mice. We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from the cortex of mice with disruption of BDNF-TrkB signaling in cortistatin interneurons, and identified differential expression of genes important for excitatory neuron function. Using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq, we define a molecular profile for Cort-expressing inhibitory neurons and subsequently compared the translatome of normal and TrkB-depleted Cort neurons, revealing alterations in calcium signaling and axon development. Several of the genes enriched in Cort neurons and differentially expressed in TrkB depleted neurons are also implicated in autism and epilepsy. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways as critical for the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and support the hypothesis that loss of BDNF signaling in Cort interneurons leads to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence suggests that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its receptor TrkB to promote inhibitory interneuron function, including a sub-population of cortistatin-expressing (Cort) neurons. This study identifies how TrkB depletion in Cort neurons impacts the Cort interneuron transcriptome as well as gene expression in the surrounding cellular milieu of mouse cortex. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways in the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and further implicate BDNF signaling as critical for regulating excitatory/inhibitory balance. We identified BDNF-regulation of a number of genes expressed in Cort neurons that are implicated in both autism and epilepsy, which is of note because these conditions are highly comorbid, and are hypothesized to share underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A mid-thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) severely impairs activation of the lower limb sensorimotor spinal networks, leading to paralysis. Various neuromodulatory techniques including electrical and pharmacological activation of the spinal networks have been successful in restoring locomotor function after SCI. We hypothesized that the combination of self-training in a natural environment with epidural stimulation (ES), quipazine (Quip), and strychnine (Strych) would result in greater activity in a cage environment after paralysis compared to either intervention alone. To assess this, we developed a method measuring and characterizing the chronic EMG recordings from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (Sol) muscles while rats were freely moving in their home cages. We then assessed the relationship between the change in recorded activity over time and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in animals receiving treatments. We found that the combination of ES, Quip, and Strych (sqES) generated the greatest level of recovery followed by ES + Quip (qES) while ES + Strych (sES) and ES alone showed least improvement in recorded activity. Further, we observed an exponential relationship between late response (LR) component of the MEPs and spontaneously generated step-like activity. Our data demonstrate the feasibility and potential importance of quantitatively monitoring mechanistic factors linked to activity-dependence in response to combinatorial interventions compared to individual therapies after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Increase of Neocortical Presynaptic Efficacy via Maturation of Vesicle Replenishment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of neocortical synapses to transmit during bursts of action potentials (APs) increases during development but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. We investigated synaptic efficacy at synapses between layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) during development, using paired recordings, presynaptic two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, and numerical simulations. Our data confirm a developmental increase in paired-pulse ratios (PPRs). Independent of age, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging revealed no AP invasion failures and linear summation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, making differences in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling an unlikely reason for developmental changes in PPR. Cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes indicate that neither the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) nor replenishment rates were different between age groups, while the time-courses of depression differed significantly. At young synapses, EPSCs depressed rapidly to near steady-state during the first four APs, and synaptic failures (F&lt;sub&gt;syn&lt;/sub&gt;) increased from 0 to 30%. At mature synapses this drop was significantly slower and strongly biphasic, such that near steady-state depression was reached not before 18 APs with F&lt;sub&gt;syn&lt;/sub&gt; remaining between 0 and 5%. While young synapses reliably transmitted during pairs of APs, albeit with strong depression, mature synapses maintained near 100% transfer efficacy with significantly less depression during high-frequency bursts of APs. Our analysis indicates that at mature synapses a replenishment pool (RepP) is responsible for their high efficacy during bursting activity, while this RepP is functionally immature at young synapses. Hence, our data provide evidence that the functional maturation of a RepP underlies increasing synaptic efficacy during the development of an excitatory cortical synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To clarify the different regional brain electroencephalogram (EEG) activities and biochemical responses in seizure and epilepsy models, we assessed the EEG and c-Fos immunolabeling characteristics in a lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model. The regional brain activities were evaluated by EEG and c-Fos immunolabeling. ZnT3 immunostaining was performed to observe hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) within 7 days after the induction of SE in the lithium-pilocarpine model. The EEG recordings showed distinctive features of activation in different brain areas. With the aggravation of the behavioral manifestations of the seizures, the frequency and amplitude of the discharges on EEG gradually increased. SE was eventually induced and sustained. The labeling of c-Fos was enhanced in the cortex and hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG); however, compared to the PTZ-induced seizure model, c-Fos staining could only be observed in the striatum and thalamus in the lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. In each brain region, prominent c-Fos labeling was observed 2 h and 4 h after the induction of SE or seizures and diminished at 24 h. During the lithium-pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy phase after SE induction, MFS was observed 7 days after SE and was accompanied by the dynamic evolution of epileptic EEG activities. These findings validated the lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE model as an epilepsy model with a specific spatial-temporal profile of neural activation. The EEG characteristics and c-Fos expression patterns differ from those presented in a previous study using a PTZ-induced seizure model. Hippocampal mossy fiber spouting might be associated with spontaneous seizures during the chronic phase and can be detected at least within 1 week by ZnT3 staining after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The lhfpl5 Ohnologs lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b Are Required for Mechanotransduction in Distinct Populations of Sensory Hair Cells in Zebrafish</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two lhfpl5 genes (lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed. Here we show that the zebrafish lhfpl5 genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: lhfpl5a expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while lhfpl5b expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, lhfpl5a mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of lhfpl5b affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the assessment of motor imagery (MI) ability in humans. Commonly, MI ability is measured through two methodologies: a self-administered questionnaire (MIQ-3) and the mental chronometry (MC), which measures the temporal discrepancy between the actual and the imagined motor tasks. However, both measures rely on subjects' self-assessment and do not use physiological measures. In this study, we propose a novel set of features extracted from the nonlinear dynamics of the eye gaze signal to discriminate between good and bad imagers. To this aim, we designed an experiment where twenty volunteers, categorized as good or bad imagers according to MC, performed three tasks: a motor task (MT), a visual Imagery task (VI), and a kinaesthetic Imagery task (KI). Throughout the experiment, the subjects' eye gaze was continuously monitored using an eye-tracking system. Eye gaze time series were analyzed through recurrence quantification analysis of the reconstructed phase space and compared between the two groups. Statistical results have shown how nonlinear eye behavior can express an inner dynamics of imagery mental process and may be used as a more objective and physiological-based measure of MI ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Untreated Patients Dying With AIDS Have Loss of Neocortical Neurons and Glia Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depletes its host CD4 cells, ultimately leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In brain, the HIV confines itself to astrocytes and microglia, the resident brain macrophages, but does not infect oligodendrocytes and neurons. Nonetheless, cognitive symptoms associated with HIV and AIDS are attributed to loss of axons and white matter damage. We used design-based stereology to estimate the numbers of neocortical neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia), in a series of 12 patients dying with AIDS before the era of retroviral treatments, and in 13 age-matched control brains. Relative to the control material, there was a 19% loss of neocortical neuron (p = 0.04) and a 29% reduction of oligodendrocytes (p = 0.003) in the patients with AIDS, whereas astrocyte and microglia numbers did not differ between patients and controls. Furthermore, we saw a 17% reduction in mean hemispheric volume in the AIDS group (p = 0.0015), which was driven by neocortical and white matter loss (p &amp;lt; 0.05), while the archicortex, subcortical gray matter, and ventricular volumes were within normal limits. Our results confirm previous reports of neuronal loss in AIDS. The new finding of oligodendrocyte loss supports the proposal that HIV in the brain provokes demyelination and axonal dysfunction and suggests that remyelination treatment strategies may be beneficial to patients suffering from HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Self-Face Paradigm Improves the Performance of the P300-Speller System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00093</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Previous studies have shown that the performance of the famous face P300-speller was better than that of the classical row/column flashing P300-speller. Furthermore, in some studies, the brain was more active when responding to one's own face than to a famous face, and a self-face stimulus elicited larger amplitude event-related potentials (ERPs) than did a famous face. Thus, we aimed to study the role of the self-face paradigm on further improving the performance of the P300-speller system with the famous face P300-speller paradigm as the control paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We designed two facial P300-speller paradigms based on the self-face and a famous face (Ming Yao, a sports star; the famous face spelling paradigm) with a neutral expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ERP amplitudes were significantly greater in the self-face than in the famous face spelling paradigm at the parietal area from 340 to 480 ms (P300), from 480 to 600 ms (P600f), and at the fronto-central area from 700 to 800 ms. Offline and online classification results showed that the self-face spelling paradigm accuracies were significantly higher than those of the famous face spelling paradigm at superposing first two times (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Similar results were found for information transfer rates (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The self-face spelling paradigm significantly improved the performance of the P300-speller system. This has significant practical applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and could avoid infringement issues caused by using images of other people's faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Aberrant Whole-Brain Transitions and Dynamics of Spontaneous Network Microstates in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Functional Connectivity (DFC) analysis is a promising approach for the characterization of brain electrophysiological activity. In this study, we investigated abnormal alterations due to mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) using DFC of the source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings. Brain activity in several well-known frequency bands was first reconstructed using beamforming of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase-locking values, which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). Subsequently, we estimated normalized Laplacian transformations of individual, statistically and topologically filtered quasi-static graphs. The corresponding eigenvalues of each node synchronization were then computed and through the neural-gas algorithm, we quantized the evolution of the eigenvalues resulting in distinct network microstates (NMstates). The discrimination level between the two groups was assessed using an iterative cross-validation classification scheme with features either the NMstates in each frequency band, or the combination of the so-called chronnectomics (flexibility index, occupancy time of NMstate, and Dwell time) with the complexity index over the evolution of the NMstates across all frequency bands. Classification performance based on chronnectomics showed 80% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, and 49% specificity. However, performance was much higher (accuracy: 91–97%, sensitivity: 100%, and specificity: 77–93%) when focusing on the microstates. Exploring the mean node degree within and between brain anatomical networks (default mode network, frontoparietal, occipital, cingulo-opercular, and sensorimotor), a reduced pattern occurred from lower to higher frequency bands, with statistically significant stronger degrees for the HC than the mTBI group. A higher entropic profile on the temporal evolution of the modularity index was observed for both NMstates for the mTBI group across frequencies. A significant difference in the flexibility index was observed between the two groups for the β frequency band. The latter finding may support a central role of the thalamus impairment in mTBI. The current study considers a complete set of frequency-dependent connectomic markers of mTBI-caused alterations in brain connectivity that potentially could serve as markers to assess the return of an injured subject back to normality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: TREM2 Regulates Heat Acclimation-Induced Microglial M2 Polarization Involving the PI3K-Akt Pathway Following EMF Exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00591</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The function of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) has been described within microglia with a beneficial activated phenotype. However, the role of TREM2 underlying microglial phenotypic alterations in the cross-tolerance protection of heat acclimation (HA) against the inflammatory stimuli electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is less well known. Here, we investigated the TREM2-related signaling mechanism induced by HA in EMF-stimulated N9 microglial cells (N9 cells). We found that EMF exposure significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and the expression of M1 markers (CD11b and CD86); meanwhile, decreased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and the expression of M2 markers (CD206 and Arg1) in N9 cells. Clearly, HA treatment decreased the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and the expression of CD11b and CD86, and enhanced the production of IL-4 and IL-10 and the expression of CD206 and Arg1. Moreover, TREM2 esiRNA and selective inhibitor of PI3K clearly decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines production, M2 markers expression, and phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt following HA plus EMF stimulation. These results indicate that TREM2 and PI3K-Akt pathway are involved in the cross-tolerance protective effect of HA in microglial polarization towards the EMF exposure. This finding inspires future studies that aim to explore the non-drug approaches underlying EMF stimulation and other central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Two Autism/Dyslexia Linked Variations of DOCK4 Disrupt the Gene Function on Rac1/Rap1 Activation, Neurite Outgrowth, and Synapse Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00577</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and dyslexia are both neurodevelopmental disorders with high prevalence in children. Both disorders have strong genetic basis, and share similar social communication deficits co-occurring with impairments of reading or language. However, whether these two disorders share common genetic risks remain elusive. DOCK4 (dedicator for cytokinesis 4), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac1, is one of few genes that are associated with both ASD and dyslexia. Dock4 is important for neuronal development and social behaviors. Two DOCK4 variations, Exon27-52 deletion (protein product: Dock4-945VS) and a missense mutation at rs2074130 (protein product: Dock4-R853H), are associated with dyslexia and/or ASD with reading difficulties. The present study explores the molecular and cellular functions of these two DOCK4 variants on neuronal development, by comparing them with the wild-type Dock4 protein. Notably, it is revealed that both mutants of Dock4 showed decreased ability to activate not only Rac1, but also another small GTPase Rap1. Consistently, both mutants were dysfunctional for regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeleton. Using Neuro-2a cells and hippocampus neurons as models, we found that both mutants had compromised function in promoting neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine formation. Electrophysiological recordings further showed that R853H partially lost the ability to promote excitatory synaptic transmission, whereas 945VS totally lost the ability. Together, we identified R853 as a previously uncharacterized site for the regulation of the integrity of Dock4 function, and provides insights in understanding the common molecular pathophysiology of ASD and dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Biphasic Effect of Buspirone on the H-Reflex in Acute Spinal Decerebrated Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00573</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological treatment facilitating locomotor expression will also have some effects on reflex expression through the modulation of spinal circuitry. Buspirone, a partial serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;), was recently shown to facilitate and even trigger locomotor movements in mice after complete spinal lesion (Tx). Here, we studied its effect on the H-reflex after acute Tx in adult mice. To avoid possible impacts of anesthetics on H-reflex depression, experiments were performed after decerebration in un-anesthetized mice (N = 20). The H-reflex in plantar muscles of the hind paw was recorded after tibial nerve stimulation 2 h after Tx at the 8th thoracic vertebrae and was compared before and every 10 min after buspirone (8 mg/kg, i.p.) for 60 min (N = 8). Frequency-dependent depression (FDD) of the H-reflex was assessed before and 60 min after buspirone. Before buspirone, a stable H-reflex could be elicited in acute spinal mice and FDD of the H-reflex was observed at 5 and 10 Hz relative to 0.2 Hz, FDD was still present 60 min after buspirone. Early after buspirone, the H-reflex was significantly decreased to 69% of pre-treatment, it then increased significantly 30–60 min after treatment, reaching 170% 60 min after injection. This effect was not observed in a control group (saline, N = 5) and was blocked when a 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist (NAD-299) was administered with buspirone (N = 7). Altogether results suggest that the reported pro-locomotor effect of buspirone occurs at a time where there is a 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors mediated reflex depression followed by a second phase marked by enhancement of reflex excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Podoplanin Gene Disruption in Mice Promotes in vivo Neural Progenitor Cells Proliferation, Selectively Impairs Dentate Gyrus Synaptic Depression and Induces Anxiety-Like Behaviors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Podoplanin (Pdpn), a brain-tumor-related glycoprotein identified in humans and animals, is endogenously expressed in several organs critical for life support such as kidney, lung, heart and brain. In the brain, Pdpn has been identified in proliferative nestin-positive adult neural progenitor cells and in neurons of the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), a structure associated to anxiety, critical for learning and memory functions and severely damaged in people with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The in vivo role of Pdpn in adult neurogenesis and anxiety-like behavior remained however unexplored. Using mice with disrupted Pdpn gene as a model organism and applying combined behavioral, molecular biological and electrophysiological assays, we here show that the absence of Pdpn selectively impairs long-term synaptic depression in the neurogenic DG without affecting the CA3-Schaffer’s collateral-CA1 synapses. Pdpn deletion also enhanced the proliferative capacity of DG neural progenitor cells and diminished survival of differentiated neuronal cells in vitro. In addition, mice with podoplanin gene disruption showed increased anxiety-like behaviors in experimentally validated behavioral tests as compared to wild type littermate controls. Together, these findings broaden our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms influencing hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in vivo and reveal Pdpn as a novel molecular target for future studies addressing general anxiety disorder and synaptic depression-related memory dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with cognitive decline and dysregulation of the circadian system, which modulates hippocampal-dependent memory as well as biological processes underlying hippocampal function. While circadian dysfunction and memory impairment are common features of aging and several neurodegenerative brain disorders, how aging impacts the circadian expression patterns of proteins involved in processes that underlie hippocampal-dependent memory is not well understood. In this study, we profiled the hippocampal proteomes of young and middle-aged mice across two circadian cycles using quantitative mass spectrometry in order to explore aging-associated changes in the temporal orchestration of biological pathways. Of the ∼1,420 proteins that were accurately quantified, 15% (214 proteins) displayed circadian rhythms in abundance in the hippocampus of young mice, while only 1.6% (23 proteins) were rhythmic in middle-aged mice. Remarkably, aging disrupted the circadian regulation of proteins involved in cellular functions critical for hippocampal function and memory, including dozens of proteins participating in pathways of energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. These included processes such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, synaptic vesicle cycling, long-term potentiation, and cytoskeletal organization. Moreover, aging altered the daily expression rhythms of proteins implicated in hallmarks of aging and the pathogenesis of several age-related neurodegenerative brain disorders affecting the hippocampus. Notably, we identified age-related alterations in the rhythmicity of proteins involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of proteostasis, as well as proteins involved in the pathogenesis of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. These insights into aging-induced changes in the hippocampal proteome provide a framework for understanding how the age-dependent circadian decline may contribute to cognitive impairment and the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing global threat to healthcare in the aging population. In the USA alone, it is estimated that one in nine persons over the age of 65 years is living with AD. The pathology is marked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, which is further enhanced by the neuroinflammatory process. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) are the major neuroinflammatory pathways that intensify AD pathogenesis. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)-mediated epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in the genesis and neuropathology of AD. Therefore, therapeutic drugs, which can target Aβ production, NLRP3 activation, and HDAC2 levels, may play a major role in reducing Aβ levels and the prevention of associated neuropathology of AD. In this study, we demonstrate that withaferin A (WA), an extract from Withania somnifera plant, significantly inhibits the Aβ production and NF-κB associated neuroinflammatory molecules’ gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cytokine release inhibitory drug 3 (CRID3), an inhibitor of NLRP3, significantly prevents inflammasome-mediated gene expression in our in vitro AD model system. We have also observed that mithramycin A (MTM), an HDAC2 inhibitor, significantly upregulated the synaptic plasticity gene expression and downregulated HDAC2 in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (SH-APP cells). Therefore, the introduction of these agents targeting Aβ production, NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation, and HDAC2 levels will have a translational significance in the prevention of neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distinct populations of neurons activated by heroin and cocaine in the striatum as assessed by catFISH</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Despite the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all addictive drugs, there is evidence suggesting that opioid and psychostimulant drugs differ substantially in terms of their neurobiological and behavioural effects. These differences may reflect separate neural circuits engaged by the two drugs. Here we used the catFISH technique to investigate the degree of overlap between neurons engaged by heroin versus cocaine in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The catFISH technique is a within-subject procedure that takes advantage of the different transcriptional time-course of the immediate-early genes &lt;i&gt;homer 1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;arc&lt;/i&gt; to determine to what extent two stimuli separated by an interval of 25 min engage the same neuronal population. We found that throughout the striatal complex the neuronal populations activated by non-contingent intravenous injections of cocaine (800 µg/kg) and heroin (100 and 200 µg/kg), administered at an interval of 25 min from each other, overlapped to a much lesser extent than in the case of two injections of cocaine (800 µg/kg), also 25 min apart. The greatest reduction in overlap between populations activated by cocaine and heroin was in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (~30% and ~22%, respectively, of the overlap observed for the sequence cocaine-cocaine). Our results point toward a significant separation between neuronal populations activated by heroin and cocaine in the striatal complex. We propose that our findings are a proof of concept that these two drugs are encoded differently in a brain area believed to be a common neurobiological substrate to drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite significant advances in the substance use disorders field, effective prevention and treatment strategies are scarce and still under active development. Here we add to growing evidence indicating major differences in the neurobiological effects of opioid versus psychostimulant drugs, which is at odds with the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all addictive drugs. This suggests that, to be effective, development of prevention and treatment strategies should not look for a &quot;silver bullet&quot; solution to all drug addictions. Instead, they should be tailored to the specific drug preference of pathological users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;In this study, we use an optogenetic inhibitor of JNK in dendritic spine sub-compartments of rat hippocampal neurons. JNK inhibition exerts rapid (within seconds) reorganisation of actin in the spine-head. Using real-time FRET to measure JNK activity, we find that either excitotoxic insult (NMDA) or endocrine stress (corticosterone), activate spine-head JNK causing internalization of AMPARs and spine retraction. Both events are prevented upon optogenetic inhibition of JNK, and rescued by JNK inhibition even 2 h after insult. Moreover, we identify that the fast-acting anti-depressant ketamine reduces JNK activity in hippocampal neurons suggesting that JNK inhibition may be a downstream mediator of its anti-depressant effect. In conclusion, we show that JNK activation plays a role in triggering spine elimination by NMDA or corticosterone stress, whereas inhibition of JNK facilitates regrowth of spines even in the continued presence of glucocorticoid. This identifies that JNK acts locally in the spine-head to promote AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage following stress, and reveals a protective function for JNK inhibition in preventing spine regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Identifying mechanisms that underlie dendritic spine elimination is important if we are to understand maladaptive changes that contribute to psychiatric disease. Compartment-specific, fast-acting tools can expedite this endeavor. Here we use a light-activated inhibitor of JNK to control kinase activity specifically in dendritic spines. Light-activation of the JNK inhibitor reduces AMPA receptor removal and spine regression in response to corticosterone and NMDA stress. Furthermore, we find that the anti-depressant drug ketamine lowers JNK activity in hippocampal neurons and prevents spine regression, though direct JNK inhibition is more effective. This study identifies a role for JNK in spine regression and may be relevant for endocrine control of synaptic strength and for conditions where chronic glucocorticoid stress leads to spine elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter pathways that surround the hippocampus comprise its afferent and efferent connections, and are therefore crucial in mediating the function of the hippocampus. We recently demonstrated a role for the hippocampus in both spatial memory and olfactory identification in humans. In the current study, we focused our attention on the fimbria-fornix white matter bundle and investigated its relationship with spatial memory and olfactory identification. We administered a virtual navigation task and an olfactory identification task to 55 young healthy adults and measured the volume of the fimbria-fornix. We found that the volume of the right fimbria-fornix and its subdivisions is correlated with both navigational learning and olfactory identification in those who use hippocampus-based spatial memory strategies, and not in those who use caudate nucleus-based navigation strategies. These results are consistent with our recent finding that spatial memory and olfaction rely on similar neural networks and structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cross-Frequency Coupling in Descending Motor Pathways: Theory and Simulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Coupling of neural oscillations is essential for the transmission of cortical motor commands to motoneuron pools through direct and indirect descending motor pathways. Most studies focus on iso-frequency coupling between brain and muscle activities, i.e., cortico-muscular coherence, which is thought to reflect motor command transmission in the mono-synaptic corticospinal pathway. Compared to this direct pathway, indirect corticobulbospinal motor pathways involve multiple intermediate synaptic connections via spinal interneurons. Neuronal processing of synaptic inputs can lead to modulation of inter-spike intervals which produces cross-frequency coupling. This theoretical study aims to evaluate the effect of the number of synaptic layers in descending pathways on the expression of cross-frequency coupling between supraspinal input and the cumulative output of the motoneuron pool using a computer simulation. We simulated descending pathways as various layers of interneurons with a terminal motoneuron pool using Hogdkin–Huxley styled neuron models. Both cross- and iso-frequency coupling between the supraspinal input and the motorneuron pool output were computed using a novel generalized coherence measure, i.e., n:m coherence. We found that the iso-frequency coupling is only dominant in the mono-synaptic corticospinal tract, while the cross-frequency coupling is dominant in multi-synaptic indirect motor pathways. Furthermore, simulations incorporating both mono-synaptic direct and multi-synaptic indirect descending pathways showed that increased reliance on a multi-synaptic indirect pathway over a mono-synaptic direct pathway enhances the dominance of cross-frequency coupling between the supraspinal input and the motorneuron pool output. These results provide the theoretical basis for future human subject study quantitatively assessing motor command transmission in indirect vs. direct pathways and its changes after neurological disorders such as unilateral brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Investigating Individual Pre-trauma Susceptibility to a PTSD-Like Phenotype in Animals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a complex condition that develops after experiencing a severe emotional trauma, with or without physical trauma. There is no known cure and evidence-based treatments, which are effective in reducing symptoms, have low retention rates. It is therefore important, in addition to seeking new therapeutics, to identify ways to reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. The fact that some, but not all, individuals exposed to the same traumatic event develop PTSD suggests that there is individual susceptibility. Investigating susceptibility and underlying factors will be better guided if there is a coherent framework for such investigations. In this review, we propose that susceptibility is a dynamic state that is comprised of susceptibility factors (before trauma) and sequalae factors (during or after trauma, but before PTSD diagnosis). We define key features of susceptibility and sequalae factors as: (1) they are detectable before trauma (susceptibility factors) or during/shortly after trauma (sequalae factors), (2) they can be manipulated, and (3) manipulation of these factors alters the likelihood of developing PTSD, thus affecting resilience. In this review we stress the importance of investigating susceptibility to PTSD with appropriate animal models, because prospective human studies are expensive and manipulation of susceptibility and sequalae factors for study purposes may not always be feasible. This review also provides a brief overview of a subset of animal models that study PTSD-related behaviors and related alterations in endocrine and brain systems that focus on individual differences, peri- and post-trauma. Attention is drawn to the RISP model (Revealing Individual Susceptibility to a PTSD-like Phenotype) which assesses susceptibility before trauma. Using the RISP model and expression of plasticity-associated immediate early genes, Arc and Homer1a, we have identified impaired hippocampal function as a potential susceptibility factor. We further discuss other putative susceptibility factors and approaches to mitigate them. We assert that this knowledge will guide successful strategies for interventions before, during or shortly after trauma that can decrease the probability of developing PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Astrocytes and Microglia Are Resistant to NAD+-Mediated Cell Death Along the ARTC2/P2X7 Axis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ADP-ribosylation of the P2X7k splice variant on mouse T cells by Ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTC2.2 in response to its substrate extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) triggers cell death. Since NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is released as a danger signal during tissue damage, this NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced cell death (NICD) may impact the survival of other cell populations co-expressing P2X7 and of one of the ARTC2 isoforms (ARTC2.1, ARTC2.2). NICD of brain-resident, non-T cell populations has only been rudimentarily investigated. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of two glia cell populations, astrocytes and microglia, towards NICD. We found that astrocytes and microglia strongly upregulate cell surface levels of ARTC2.1 and ADP-ribosylation of cell surface proteins in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 inhibitor U0126, but do not respond to extracellular NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with P2X7 activation and induction of cell death. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes and microglia preferentially express the ADP-ribosylation-insensitive P2X7a splice variant, likely accounting for the resistance of these cells to NICD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To investigate the mechanisms underlying the gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) changes in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study consisted of 21 patients with aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. All participants underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and testing each individual’s visual acuity was done.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder patients showed significantly reduced GMV in the left calcarine, left thalamus and right lingual gyrus of the NMOSD patients when compared to HC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). NMOSD patients showed significantly decreased FC values (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in both the left and right calcarine, right lingual gyrus and left thalamus, respectively, when compared to HC. We also observed a positive correlation between the FC values of the left thalamus, bilateral calcarine gyrus and the visual acuity, respectively (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, a negative association was seen between the duration of the disease, frequency of optic neuritis, and the FC values in the lingual gyrus, bilateral calcarine gyrus, and right lingual gyrus, respectively (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Reduced visual acuity and frequency of optic neuritis are associated with alterations in the GMV and FC in NMOSD. Our current study, which provides imaging evidence on the impairment involved in NMOSD, sheds light on pathophysiological responses of optic neuritis attack on the brain especially on the visual network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Automated Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using a Convolutional Neural Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significant progress in speech recognition, image classification, automotive software engineering, and neuroscience. This impressive progress is largely due to a combination of algorithmic breakthroughs, computation resource improvements, and access to a large amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: In this paper, we focus on the automated detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using CNN with a brain imaging dataset. We detected ASD patients using most common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a multi-site dataset named the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange (ABIDE). The proposed approach was able to classify ASD and control subjects based on the patterns of functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed model is able to detect ASD correctly with an accuracy of 70.22% using the ABIDE I dataset and the CC400 functional parcellation atlas of the brain. Also, the CNN model developed used fewer parameters than the state-of-art techniques and is hence computationally less intensive. Our developed model is ready to be tested with more data and can be used to prescreen ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Fitness Framework: Towards Assessing, Training and Augmenting Individual-Difference Factors Underpinning High-Performance Cognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00466</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00466</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this article is to introduce the concept of Cognitive Fitness (CF), identify its key ingredients underpinning both real-time task performance and career longevity in high-risk occupations, and to canvas a holistic framework for their assessment, training, and augmentation. CF as a capacity to deploy neurocognitive resources, knowledge and skills to meet the demands of operational task performance, is likely to be multi-faceted and differentially malleable. A taxonomy of CF constructs derived from Cognitive Readiness (CR) and Mental fitness (MF) literature maps into phases of operational cycle from foundational to advanced, mission-ready and recovery. Foundational cognitive attributes, such as attention, executive control and co-action, were hypothesized to be trainable at the initial Cognitive Gym phase. More advanced training targets at the CR phase included stress and arousal regulation, adaptability, teamwork, situation awareness (including detection, sense-making and prediction) and decision making (de-biasing and confidence calibration). The mission-ready training phase is focused on tolerances (to sleep loss, monotony, pain, frustration, uncertainty) and resistance (to distraction, deception or manipulation). Operational Augmentation phase relies on support tools such as decision aids and fatigue countermeasures, while the Recovery phase employs reflexive (e.g., mindfulness), and restorative practices (e.g., nutrition and sleep hygiene). The periodization of cognitive training in this cycle is hypothesized to optimize both real-time cognitive performance and the resilience that enables life-long thriving. One of the most promising avenues of validating this hypothesis is by developing an expert consensus on the key CF ingredients and their relative importance in high-performance settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuroinflammation and White Matter Alterations in Obesity Assessed by Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00464</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human obesity is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, alterations in brain structure and function, and cognitive impairment. Rodent models of obesity show that high-calorie diets cause brain inflammation (neuroinflammation) in multiple regions, including the hippocampus, and impairments in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. To determine if similar effects exist in humans with obesity, we applied Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) to evaluate neuroinflammation and axonal integrity. We examined diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in two independent cohorts of obese and non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: 25 obese/21 non-obese; Cohort 2: 18 obese/41 non-obese). We applied Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to allow whole-brain white matter (WM) analyses and compare DBSI-derived isotropic and anisotropic diffusion measures between the obese and non-obese groups. In both cohorts, the obese group had significantly greater DBSI-derived restricted fraction (DBSI-RF; an indicator of neuroinflammation-related cellularity), and significantly lower DBSI-derived fiber fraction (DBSI-FF; an indicator of apparent axonal density) in several WM tracts (all corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, using region of interest analyses, average DBSI-RF and DBSI-FF values in the hippocampus were significantly greater and lower, respectively, in obese relative to non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: p = 0.045; Cohort 2: p = 0.008). Hippocampal DBSI-FF and DBSI-RF and amygdalar DBSI-FF metrics related to cognitive performance in Cohort 2. In conclusion, these findings suggest that greater neuroinflammation-related cellularity and lower apparent axonal density are associated with human obesity and cognitive performance. Future studies are warranted to determine a potential role for neuroinflammation in obesity-related cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Short-Term Classification Learning Promotes Rapid Global Improvements of Information Processing in Human Brain Functional Connectome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classification learning is a preeminent human ability within the animal kingdom but the key mechanisms of brain networks regulating learning remain mostly elusive. Recent neuroimaging advancements have depicted human brain as a complex graph machinery where brain regions are nodes and coherent activities among them represent the functional connections. While long-term motor memories have been found to alter functional connectivity in the resting human brain, a graph topological investigation of the short-time effects of learning are still not widely investigated. For instance, classification learning is known to orchestrate rapid modulation of diverse memory systems like short-term and visual working memories but how the brain functional connectome accommodates such modulations is unclear. We used publicly available repositories (openfmri.org) selecting three experiments, two focused on short-term classification learning along two consecutive runs where learning was promoted by trial-by-trial feedback errors, while a further experiment was used as supplementary control. We analyzed the functional connectivity extracted from BOLD fMRI signals, and estimated the graph information processing in the cerebral networks. The information processing capability, characterized by complex network statistics, significantly improved over runs, together with the subject classification accuracy. Instead, null-learning experiments, where feedbacks came with poor consistency, did not provoke any significant change in the functional connectivity over runs. We propose that learning induces fast modifications in the overall brain network dynamics, definitely ameliorating the short-term potential of the brain to process and integrate information, a dynamic consistently orchestrated by modulations of the functional connections among specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cross-Situational Statistical Learning of New Words Despite Bilateral Hippocampal Damage and Severe Amnesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00448</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00448</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Word learning requires learners to bind together arbitrarily-related phonological, visual, and conceptual information. Prior work suggests that this binding can be robustly achieved via incidental cross-situational statistical exposure to words and referents. When cross-situational statistical learning (CSSL) is tested in the laboratory, there is no information on any given trial to identify the referent of a novel word. However, by tracking which objects co-occur with each word across trials, learners may acquire mappings through statistical association. While CSSL behavior is well-characterized, its brain correlates are not. The arbitrary nature of CSSL mappings suggests hippocampal involvement, but the incremental, statistical nature of the learning raises the possibility of neocortical or procedural learning systems. Prior studies have shown that neurological patients with hippocampal pathology have word-learning impairments, but this has not been tested in a statistical learning paradigm. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test whether patients with bilateral hippocampal pathology (N = 3) could learn new words in a CSSL paradigm. In the task, patients and healthy comparison participants completed a CSSL word-learning task in which they acquired eight word/object mappings. During each trial of the CSSL task, participants saw two objects on a computer display, heard one novel word, and selected the most likely referent. Across trials, words were 100% likely to co-occur with their referent, but only 14.3% likely with non-referents. Two of three amnesic patients learned the associations between objects and word forms, although performance was impaired relative to healthy comparison participants. Our findings show that the hippocampus is not strictly necessary for CSSL for words, although it may facilitate such learning. This is consistent with a hybrid account of CSSL supported by implicit and explicit memory systems, and may have translational applications for remediation of (word-) learning deficits in neurological populations with hippocampal pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Inhibitory Network Bistability Explains Increased Interneuronal Activity Prior to Seizure Onset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00081</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00081</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent experimental literature has revealed that GABAergic interneurons exhibit increased activity prior to seizure onset, alongside additional evidence that such activity is synchronous and may arise abruptly. These findings have led some to hypothesize that this interneuronal activity may serve a causal role in driving the sudden change in brain activity that heralds seizure onset. However, the mechanisms predisposing an inhibitory network toward increased activity, specifically prior to ictogenesis, without a permanent change to inputs to the system remain unknown. We address this question by comparing simulated inhibitory networks containing control interneurons and networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons modeled to mimic treatment with 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), an agent commonly used to model seizures in vivo and in vitro. Our in silico study demonstrates that model inhibitory networks with 4-AP interneurons are more prone than their control counterparts to exist in a bistable state in which asynchronously firing networks can abruptly transition into synchrony driven by a brief perturbation. This transition into synchrony brings about a corresponding increase in overall firing rate. We further show that perturbations driving this transition could arise in vivo from background excitatory synaptic activity in the cortex. Thus, we propose that bistability explains the increase in interneuron activity observed experimentally prior to seizure via a transition from incoherent to coherent dynamics. Moreover, bistability explains why inhibitory networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons are more vulnerable to this change in dynamics, and how such networks can undergo a transition without a permanent change in the drive. We note that while our comparisons are between networks of control and ictogenic neurons, the conclusions drawn specifically relate to the unusual dynamics that arise prior to seizure, and not seizure onset itself. However, providing a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon specifically in a pro-ictogenic setting generates experimentally testable hypotheses regarding the role of inhibitory neurons in pre-ictal neural dynamics, and motivates further computational research into mechanisms underlying a newly hypothesized multi-step pathway to seizure initiated by inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: VIP/PACAP-Based Drug Development: The ADNP/NAP-Derived Mirror Peptides SKIP and D-SKIP Exhibit Distinctive in vivo and in silico Effects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) was discovered and first characterized in the laboratory of Prof. Illana Gozes to be regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) toward neuroprotection. Importantly, ADNP is a master regulator of &amp;gt;400 genes, essential for brain formation, while its haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairments. Recently, de novo mutations in ADNP were identified as leading to the autism-like ADNP syndrome, mimicked by the Adnp-deficient mouse model. Furthermore, novel peptide derivatives of the neuroprotective ADNP-snippet NAP (NAPVSIPQ), developed in our laboratory, include SKIP and the mirroring all D-amino acid SKIP (D-SKIP). We now extended previous evidence suggesting potential antagonistic features for D-SKIP, compared with the neuroprotective peptide SKIP, as was observed by NMR analysis and social/olfactory functional testing. Here, an impact of the Adnp genotype was observed in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test measuring cognition, coupled with improvement by SKIP, opposing the inert/exacerbating effect of D-SKIP. In the elevated plus-maze and open field tests measuring anxiety-related behaviors, contrasting effects of SKIP and D-SKIP were found, with SKIP improving/preserving the normal phenotype of the mouse, and D-SKIP causing alterations. Lastly, an in silico analysis suggested that SKIP and D-SKIP bind the microtubule end binding (EB) proteins EB1 and EB3 in different conformations, thereby indicating distinctive natures for the two peptides, potentially mediating differential in vivo effects. Altogether, our findings corroborate the notion of D-SKIP acting as an antagonist, thus distinguishing it from the neuroprotective SKIP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent uncontrolled seizures and has an idiopathic “genetic” etiology or a symptomatic “acquired” component. Genetic studies have revealed that many epilepsy susceptibility genes encode ion channels, including voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels. The high prevalence of ion channels in epilepsy pathogenesis led to the causative concept of “ion channelopathies,” which can be elicited by specific mutations in the coding or promoter regions of genes in genetic epilepsies. Intriguingly, expression changes of the same ion channel genes by augmentation of specific transcription factors (TFs) early after an insult can underlie acquired epilepsies. In this study, we review how the transcriptional regulation of ion channels in both genetic and acquired epilepsies can be controlled, and compare these epilepsy “ion channelopathies” with other neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Daily exposure of awake mice to a phase-reversing visual grating stimulus leads to enhancement of the visual-evoked potential (VEP) in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1). This stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) resembles and shares mechanistic requirements with canonical long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). However, it remains to be determined how this augmentation of a population response translates into altered neuronal activity of individual V1 neurons. To address this question, we performed longitudinal calcium imaging of layer 4 excitatory neurons in V1 and tracked changes associated with the induction and expression of SRP. We found no evidence for a net change in the fraction of visually responsive neurons as the stimulus became familiar. However, endoscopic calcium imaging of layer 4 principal neurons revealed that somatic calcium transients in response to phase-reversals of the familiar visual stimulus are reduced and undergo strong within-session adaptation. Conversely, neuropil calcium responses and VEPs are enhanced during familiar stimulus viewing, and the VEPs show reduced within-session adaptation. Consistent with the exquisite selectivity of SRP, the plasticity of cellular responses to phase-reversing gratings did not translate into altered orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. Our findings suggest a model in which augmentation of fast, short-latency synaptic (dendritic) responses, manifested as enhanced layer 4 VEPs, recruits inhibition to suppress cellular activity. Reduced cellular activity to the familiar stimulus may account for the behavioral correlate of SRP, orientation-selective long-term habituation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Chronic PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade Does Not Affect Cognition or Promote Tau Clearance in a Tauopathy Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade with an antibody has been shown to reduce amyloid-β plaques, associated pathologies and cognitive impairment in mouse models. More recently, this approach has shown effectiveness in a tauopathy mouse model to improve cognition and reduce tau lesions. Follow-up studies by other laboratories did not see similar benefits of this type of therapy in other amyloid-β plaque models. Here, we report a modest increase in locomotor activity but no effect on cognition or tau pathology, in a different more commonly used tauopathy model following a weekly treatment for 12 weeks with the same PD-1 antibody and isotype control as in the original Aβ- and tau-targeting studies. These findings indicate that further research is needed before clinical trials based on PD-1 checkpoint immune blockage are devised for tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Through a number of an extensive autopsy, biomarker, and genomics studies, researchers have recently defined a novel type of dementia known as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE is perhaps best characterized by the presence of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43, which plays multi-functional roles through interactions with DNA and RNA, leading to significant alterations in the transcription and translation of particular genes. As individuals of advanced age represent a rapidly growing demographic group globally, there is a steadily increasing rate of LATE incidence that has to date received insufficient recognition despite its serious implications for public health. TDP-43 is the common pathology of various age-related dementia, therefore, it may be a potential and promising therapeutic target for such diseases. In the present review, we discuss the pathways regulating TDP-43 expression, metabolism, and disease activity in order to better understand the link between TDP-43 proteinopathy and LATE at the genetic, pathological, and clinical levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: DetEdit: A graphical user interface for annotating and editing events detected in long-term acoustic monitoring data</title>

Passive acoustic monitoring has become an important data collection method, yielding massive datasets replete with biological, environmental and anthropogenic information. Automated signal detectors and classifiers are needed to identify events within these datasets, such as the presence of species-specific sounds or anthropogenic noise. These automated methods, however, are rarely a complete substitute for expert analyst review. The ability to visualize and annotate acoustic events efficiently can enhance scientific insights from large, previously intractable datasets. A MATLAB-based graphical user interface, called &lt;i&gt;DetEdit&lt;/i&gt;, was developed to accelerate the editing and annotating of automated detections from extensive acoustic datasets. This tool is highly-configurable and multipurpose, with uses ranging from annotation and classification of individual signals or signal-clusters and evaluation of signal properties, to identification of false detections and false positive rate estimation. &lt;i&gt;DetEdit&lt;/i&gt; allows users to step through acoustic events, displaying a range of signal features, including time series of received levels, long-term spectral averages, time intervals between detections, and scatter plots of peak frequency, RMS, and peak-to-peak received levels. Additionally, it displays either individual, or averaged sound pressure waveforms, and power spectra within each acoustic event. These views simultaneously provide analysts with signal-level detail and encounter-level context. &lt;i&gt;DetEdit&lt;/i&gt; creates datasets of signal labels for further analyses, such as training classifiers and quantifying occurrence, abundances, or trends. Although designed for evaluating underwater-recorded odontocete echolocation click detections, &lt;i&gt;DetEdit&lt;/i&gt; can be adapted to almost any stereotyped impulsive signal. Our software package complements available tools for the bioacoustic community and is provided open source at https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/DetEdit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h3cfPYcpED4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing threat to public health. Current methods of determining AMR rely on inefficient phenotypic approaches, and there remains incomplete understanding of AMR mechanisms for many pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. Given the rapid, ongoing increase in availability of high-density genomic data for a diverse array of bacteria, development of algorithms that could utilize genomic information to predict phenotype could both be useful clinically and assist with discovery of heretofore unrecognized AMR pathways. To facilitate understanding of the connections between DNA variation and phenotypic AMR, we developed a new bioinformatics tool, variant mapping and prediction of antibiotic resistance (VAMPr), to (1) derive gene ortholog-based sequence features for protein variants; (2) interrogate these explainable gene-level variants for their known or novel associations with AMR; and (3) build accurate models to predict AMR based on whole genome sequencing data. We curated the publicly available sequencing data for 3,393 bacterial isolates from 9 species that contained AMR phenotypes for 29 antibiotics. We detected 14,615 variant genotypes and built 93 association and prediction models. The association models confirmed known genetic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, such as &lt;i&gt;blaKPC&lt;/i&gt; and carbapenem resistance consistent with the accurate nature of our approach. The prediction models achieved high accuracies (mean accuracy of 91.1% for all antibiotic-pathogen combinations) internally through nested cross validation and were also validated using external clinical datasets. The VAMPr variant detection method, association and prediction models will be valuable tools for AMR research for basic scientists with potential for clinical applicability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gf9k_mpe_uQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of actin protrusion dynamics in cell migration through a degradable viscoelastic extracellular matrix: Insights from a computational model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007250</guid>

Actin protrusion dynamics plays an important role in the regulation of three-dimensional (3D) cell migration. Cells form protrusions that adhere to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), mechanically probe the ECM and contract in order to displace the cell body. This results in cell migration that can be directed by the mechanical anisotropy of the ECM. However, the subcellular processes that regulate protrusion dynamics in 3D cell migration are difficult to investigate experimentally and therefore not well understood. Here, we present a computational model of cell migration through a degradable viscoelastic ECM. This model is a 2D representation of 3D cell migration. The cell is modeled as an active deformable object that captures the viscoelastic behavior of the actin cortex and the subcellular processes underlying 3D cell migration. The ECM is regarded as a viscoelastic material, with or without anisotropy due to fibrillar strain stiffening, and modeled by means of the meshless Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. ECM degradation is captured by local fluidization of the material and permits cell migration through the ECM. We demonstrate that changes in ECM stiffness and cell strength affect cell migration and are accompanied by changes in number, lifetime and length of protrusions. Interestingly, directly changing the total protrusion number or the average lifetime or length of protrusions does not affect cell migration. A stochastic variability in protrusion lifetime proves to be enough to explain differences in cell migration velocity. Force-dependent adhesion disassembly does not result in faster migration, but can make migration more efficient. We also demonstrate that when a number of simultaneous protrusions is enforced, the optimal number of simultaneous protrusions is one or two, depending on ECM anisotropy. Together, the model provides non-trivial new insights in the role of protrusions in 3D cell migration and can be a valuable contribution to increase the understanding of 3D cell migration mechanics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QBjgc7MAzWg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Allopregnanolone Modulates GABAAR-Dependent CaMKIIδ3 and BDNF to Protect SH-SY5Y Cells Against 6-OHDA-Induced Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00569</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Allopregnanolone (APα), as a functional neurosteroid, exhibits the neuroprotective effect on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) through γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR), but it has not been completely understood about its molecular mechanisms. In order to investigate the neuroprotective effect of APα, as well as to clarify its possible molecular mechanisms, SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines were incubated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which has been widely used as an in vitro model for PD, along with APα alone or in combination with GABAAR antagonist (bicuculline, Bic), intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelator (EGTA) and voltage-gated L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker (Nifedipine). The viability, proliferation, and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, the expression levels of calmodulin (CaM), Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ3 (CaMKIIδ3), cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as the interaction between CaMKIIδ3 and CDK1 or BDNF, were detected by morphological and molecular biological methodology. Our results found that the cell viability and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and TH/BrdU-positive cells in 6-OHDA-treated SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased with the concomitant reduction in the expression levels of aforementioned proteins, which were ameliorated following APα administration. In addition, Bic could further increase the number of TH or BrdU-positive cells as well as the expression levels of aforementioned proteins except for TH/BrdU-double positive cells, while EGTA and Nifedipine could attenuate the expression levels of CaM, CaMKIIδ3 and BDNF. Moreover, there existed a direct interaction between CaMKIIδ3 and CDK1 or BDNF. As a result, APα-induced an increase in the number of TH-positive SH-SY5Y cells might be mediated through GABAAR via Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM/CaMKIIδ3/BDNF (CDK1) signaling pathway, which would ultimately facilitate to elucidate PD pathogenesis and hold a promise as an alternative therapeutic target for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamic distribution decomposition for single-cell snapshot time series identifies subpopulations and trajectories during iPSC reprogramming</title>

Recent high-dimensional single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry are enabling time series experiments to monitor the temporal evolution of cell state distributions and to identify dynamically important cell states, such as fate decision states in differentiation. However, these technologies are destructive, and require analysis approaches that temporally map between cell state distributions across time points. Current approaches to approximate the single-cell time series as a dynamical system suffer from too restrictive assumptions about the type of kinetics, or link together pairs of sequential measurements in a discontinuous fashion. We propose Dynamic Distribution Decomposition (DDD), an operator approximation approach to infer a continuous distribution map between time points. On the basis of single-cell snapshot time series data, DDD approximates the continuous time Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a finite set of basis functions. This procedure can be interpreted as a continuous time Markov chain over a continuum of states. By only assuming a memoryless Markov (autonomous) process, the types of dynamics represented are more general than those represented by other common models, e.g., chemical reaction networks, stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we can &lt;i&gt;a posteriori&lt;/i&gt; check whether the autonomy assumptions are valid by calculation of prediction error—which we show gives a measure of autonomy within the studied system. The continuity and autonomy assumptions ensure that the same dynamical system maps between all time points, not arbitrarily changing at each time point. We demonstrate the ability of DDD to reconstruct dynamically important cell states and their transitions both on synthetic data, as well as on mass cytometry time series of iPSC reprogramming of a fibroblast system. We use DDD to find previously identified subpopulations of cells and to visualise differentiation trajectories. Dynamic Distribution Decomposition allows interpretation of high-dimensional snapshot time series data as a low-dimensional Markov process, thereby enabling an interpretable dynamics analysis for a variety of biological processes by means of identifying their dynamically important cell states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0-mUa0zfZ6o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Healthy Subjects With Extreme Patterns of Performance Differ in Functional Network Topology and Benefits From Nicotine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00083</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Do subjects with atypical patterns in attentional and executive behaviour show different brain network topology and react differently towards nicotine administration? The efficacy of pro-cognitive drugs like nicotine considerably varies between subjects and previous theoretical and empirical evidence suggest stronger behavioural nicotine effects in subjects with low performance. One problem is, however, how to best define low performance, especially if several cognitive functions are assessed for subject characterisation. We here present a method that used a multivariate, robust outlier detection algorithm to identify subjects with suspicious patterns of performance in attentional and executive functioning. In contrast to univariate approaches, this method is sensitive towards extreme positions within the multidimensional space that do not have to be extreme values in the individual behavioural distributions. The method was applied to a dataset of healthy, non-smoking subjects (n = 34) who were behaviorally characterised by an attention and executive function test on which N = 12 volunteers were classified as outliers. All subjects then underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan to characterise brain network topology and an experimental behavioural paradigm under placebo and nicotine (7 mg patch) that gauged aspects of attention and executive function. Our results indicate that subjects with an atypical multivariate pattern in attention and executive functioning showed significant differences in nodal brain network integration in visual association and pre-motor brain regions during resting state. These differences in brain network topology significantly predicted larger individual nicotine effects on attentional processing. In summary, the current approach successfully identified a subgroup of healthy volunteers with low behavioural performance who differ in brain network topology and attentional benefit from nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Correlates of Vestibular Processing During a Spaceflight Analog With Elevated Carbon Dioxide (CO2): A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00080</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00080</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astronauts return to Earth from spaceflight missions with impaired mobility and balance; recovery can last weeks postflight. This is due in large part to the altered vestibular signaling and sensory reweighting that occurs in microgravity. The neural mechanisms of spaceflight-induced vestibular changes are not well understood. Head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) is a common spaceflight analog environment that allows for study of body unloading, fluid shifts, and other consequences of spaceflight. Subjects in this context still show vestibular changes despite being in Earth’s gravitational environment, potentially due to sensory reweighting. Previously, we found evidence of sensory reweighting and reduced neural efficiency for vestibular processing in subjects who underwent a 70-day HDBR intervention. Here we extend this work by evaluating the impact of HDBR paired with elevated carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to mimic International Space Station conditions on vestibular neural processing. Eleven participants (6 males, 34 ± 8 years) completed 30 days of HDBR combined with 0.5% atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Participants underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post- HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while we measured brain activity in response to pneumatic skull taps (a validated method of vestibular stimulation). We also measured mobility and balance performance several times before and after the intervention. We found support for adaptive neural changes within the vestibular system during bed rest that subsequently recovered in several cortical and cerebellar regions. Further, there were multiple brain regions where greater pre- to post- deactivation was associated with reduced pre- to post- balance declines. That is, increased deactivation of certain brain regions associated with better balance post-HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We also found that, compared to HDBR alone (n = 13 males; 29 ± 3 years) HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is associated with greater increases in activation of multiple frontal, parietal, and temporal regions during vestibular stimulation. This suggests interactive or additive effects of bed rest and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, we found stronger correlations between pre- to post- HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; brain changes and dependence on the visual system during balance for subjects who developed signs of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). Together, these findings have clear implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of bed rest and spaceflight-related changes in vestibular processing, as well as adaptation to altered sensory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Presynaptic Boutons That Contain Mitochondria Are More Stable</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The addition and removal of presynaptic terminals reconfigures neuronal circuits of the mammalian neocortex, but little is known about how this presynaptic structural plasticity is controlled. Since mitochondria can regulate presynaptic function, we investigated whether the presence of axonal mitochondria relates to the structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons in mouse neocortex. We found that the overall density of axonal mitochondria did not appear to influence the loss and gain of boutons. However, positioning of mitochondria at individual presynaptic sites did relate to increased stability of those boutons. In line with this, synaptic localization of mitochondria increased as boutons aged and showed differing patterns of localization at en passant and terminaux boutons. These results suggest that mitochondria accumulate locally at boutons over time to increase bouton stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acute Liver Failure Induces Glial Reactivity, Oxidative Stress and Impairs Brain Energy Metabolism in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00327</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acute liver failure (ALF) implies a severe and rapid liver dysfunction that leads to impaired liver metabolism and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Recent studies have suggested that several brain alterations such as astrocytic dysfunction and energy metabolism impairment may synergistically interact, playing a role in the development of HE. The purpose of the present study is to investigate early alterations in redox status, energy metabolism and astrocytic reactivity of rats submitted to ALF. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted either to subtotal hepatectomy (92% of liver mass) or sham operation to induce ALF. Twenty-four hours after the surgery, animals with ALF presented higher plasmatic levels of ammonia, lactate, ALT and AST and lower levels of glucose than the animals in the sham group. Animals with ALF presented several astrocytic morphological alterations indicating astrocytic reactivity. The ALF group also presented higher mitochondrial oxygen consumption, higher enzymatic activity and higher ATP levels in the brain (frontoparietal cortex). Moreover, ALF induced an increase in glutamate oxidation concomitant with a decrease in glucose and lactate oxidation. The increase in brain energy metabolism caused by astrocytic reactivity resulted in augmented levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and a decreased activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). These findings suggest that in the early stages of ALF the brain presents a hypermetabolic state, oxidative stress and astrocytic reactivity, which could be in part sustained by an increase in mitochondrial oxidation of glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Expression Profiles and Functional Prediction of tRNA-Derived Small RNAs in Rats After Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00326</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is mostly caused by trauma. As the primary mechanical injury is unavoidable, a focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the SCI-induced secondary injury is necessary to develop promising treatments for patients with SCI. Transfer RNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) is a novel class of short, non-coding RNA, possessing potential regulatory functions in various diseases. However, the functional roles of tsRNAs in traumatic SCI have not been determined yet. We used a combination of sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), bioinformatics, and luciferase reporter assay to screen the expression profiles and identify the functional roles of tsRNAs after SCI. As a result, 297 differentially expressed tsRNAs were identified in rats’ spinal cord 1 day after contusion. Of those, 155 tsRNAs were significantly differentially expressed: 91 were significantly up-regulated, whereas 64 were significantly down-regulated after SCI (fold change &amp;gt; 1.5; P &amp;lt; 0.05). Bioinformatics analyses revealed candidate tsRNAs (tiRNA-Gly-GCC-001, tRF-Gly-GCC-012, tRF-Gly-GCC-013, and tRF-Gly-GCC-016) that might play regulatory roles through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and neurotrophin signaling pathways by targeting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We validated the candidate tsRNAs and found opposite trends in the expression levels of the tsRNAs and BDNF after SCI. Finally, tiRNA-Gly-GCC-001 was identified to target BDNF using the luciferase reporter assay. In summary, we found an altered tsRNA expression pattern and predicted tiRNA-Gly-GCC-001 might be involved in the MAPK and neurotrophin pathways by targeting the BDNF, thus regulating the post-SCI pathophysiologic processes. This study provides novel insights for future investigations to explore the mechanisms and therapeutic targets for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Internal Clocks, mGluR7 and Microtubules: A Primer for the Molecular Encoding of Target Durations in Cerebellar Purkinje Cells and Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of studies in the field of timing and time perception have generally focused on sub- and supra-second time scales, specific behavioral processes, and/or discrete neuronal circuits. In an attempt to find common elements of interval timing from a broader perspective, we review the literature and highlight the need for cell and molecular studies that can delineate the neural mechanisms underlying temporal processing. Moreover, given the recent attention to the function of microtubule proteins and their potential contributions to learning and memory consolidation/re-consolidation, we propose that these proteins play key roles in coding temporal information in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). The presence of microtubules at relevant neuronal sites, as well as their adaptability, dynamic structure, and longevity, makes them a suitable candidate for neural plasticity at both intra- and inter-cellular levels. As a consequence, microtubules appear capable of maintaining a temporal code or engram and thereby regulate the firing patterns of PCs and MSNs known to be involved in interval timing. This proposed mechanism would control the storage of temporal information triggered by postsynaptic activation of mGluR7. This, in turn, leads to alterations in microtubule dynamics through a “read-write” memory process involving alterations in microtubule dynamics and their hexagonal lattice structures involved in the molecular basis of temporal memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inflammatory Role of TLR-MyD88 Signaling in Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder leading to chronic inflammation, demyelination, axonal, and neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite intense research efforts, the pathogenesis of MS still remains unclear. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of type I transmembrane receptors that play a crucial role in the innate immune response. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is the adaptor of major TLRs. It has been widely considered that the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway plays an important role in the occurrence and development of autoimmune disease. Data have revealed that the TLR-MyD88 signaling may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, by regulating the antigen presentation of dendritic cells, the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the activation of T cells and B cells. Here, we summarize the role of TLRs and MyD88 in MS and discuss the possible therapies that are based on these molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multi-sensory Responsiveness and Personality Traits Predict Daily Pain Sensitivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00077</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00077</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: A continuous effort has been devoted to identifying factors that contribute to individual differences in pain perception. Amongst the personality traits, Neuroticism is assumed to be the most significant moderator of experimental and clinical pain. Multi-sensory responsiveness to daily sensations has been shown to be associated with pain perception. Yet, neither the relationship between personality traits and multi-sensory responsiveness nor the impact of both these factors to pain perception have been examined. Thus, this study aims to explore the contribution of both multi-sensory responsiveness and personality traits to pain perception in a daily context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A community-based sample of 204 adults completed the Sensory Responsiveness Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The partial eta-square demonstrated that the SRQ-IS Aversive sub-scale score had the strongest relationship with the PSQ-Total score, accounting for 9% of the variation. The regression coefficient relating PSQ-Total score with SRQ-IS Aversive, and BFI sub-scales of Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness-to-Experience scores was found to be r = 0.39 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), accounting for 16% of the variance, and yielding a large effect size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report on the interplay between aversive responsiveness to daily sensations and personality traits of Neuroticism, Openness-to-Experience, and Extraversion as contributing factors to daily pain sensitivity, amongst which aversive responsiveness was found as the major contributing factor. This study may broaden the understanding of the pain experience variability, both in practice and in experimental research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: One-Shot Tagging During Wake and Cueing During Sleep With Spatiotemporal Patterns of Transcranial Electrical Stimulation Can Boost Long-Term Metamemory of Individual Episodes in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5–12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has not yet addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, or dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings. Further, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over one’s lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive non-sensory paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes in immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). In particular, we demonstrated that these STAMPs can be re-applied as brief pulses during SWOs in sleep to achieve about 10–20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes compared to the control episodes at 48 hours after initial viewing. We found that STAMPs can not only facilitate but also impair metamemory for the targeted episodes based on an interaction between pre-sleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (8–12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Chronically Implanted Microelectrodes Cause c-fos Expression Along Their Trajectory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When designing electrodes and probes for brain–machine interfaces, one of the challenges faced involves minimizing the brain-tissue response, which would otherwise create an environment that is detrimental for the accurate functioning of such probes. Following the implantation process, the brain reacts with a sterile inflammation response and resulting astrocytic glial scar formation, potentially resulting in neuronal cell loss around the implantation site. Such alterations in the naïve brain tissue can hinder both the quality of neuronal recordings, and the efficacy of deep-brain stimulation. In this study, we chronically implanted a glass-supported polyimide microelectrode in the dorsolateral striatum of Sprague–Dawley rats. The effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) was investigated using c-fos immunoreactivity techniques. GFAP and ED1 immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the brain-tissue response. No changes in c-fos expression were found for either the acute or chronic stimulus groups; although a c-fos expression was found along the length of the implantation trajectory, following chronic implantation of our stiffened polyimide microelectrode. Furthermore, we also observed the formation of a glial scar around the microelectrode, with an accompanying low number of inflammation cells. Histological and statistical analysis of NeuN-positive cells did not demonstrate a pronounced “kill zone” with accompanying neuronal cell death around the implantation site, neither on the polymer side, nor on the glass side of the PI-glass probe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Unsupervised Cerebrovascular Segmentation of TOF-MRA Images Based on Deep Neural Network and Hidden Markov Random Field Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated cerebrovascular segmentation of time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) images is an important technique, which can be used to diagnose abnormalities in the cerebrovascular system, such as vascular stenosis and malformation. Automated cerebrovascular segmentation can direct show the shape, direction and distribution of blood vessels. Although deep neural network (DNN)-based cerebrovascular segmentation methods have shown to yield outstanding performance, they are limited by their dependence on huge training dataset. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cerebrovascular segmentation method of TOF-MRA images based on DNN and hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model. Our DNN-based cerebrovascular segmentation model is trained by the labeling of HMRF rather than manual annotations. The proposed method was trained and tested using 100 TOF-MRA images. The results were evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which reached a value of 0.79. The trained model achieved better performance than that of the traditional HMRF-based cerebrovascular segmentation method in binary pixel-classification. This paper combines the advantages of both DNN and HMRF to train the model with a not so large amount of the annotations in deep learning, which leads to a more effective cerebrovascular segmentation method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Contact Heat Evoked Potentials Are Responsive to Peripheral Sensitization: Requisite Stimulation Parameters</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sensitizing effect of capsaicin has been previously characterized using laser and contact heat evoked potentials (LEPs and CHEPs) by stimulating in the primary area of hyperalgesia. Interestingly, only CHEPs reveal changes consistent with notion of peripheral sensitization (i.e., reduced latencies). The aim of this study was to investigate contact heat stimulation parameters necessary to detect peripheral sensitization related to the topical application of capsaicin, and therefore significantly improve the current method of measuring peripheral sensitization via CHEPs. Rapid contact heat stimulation (70°C/s) was applied from three different baseline temperatures (35, 38.5, and 42°C) to a 52°C peak temperature, before and after the topical application of capsaicin on the hand dorsum. Increased pain ratings in the primary area of hyperalgesia were accompanied by reduced N2 latency. Changes in N2 latency were, however, only significant following stimulation from 35 and 38.5°C baseline temperatures. These findings suggest that earlier recruitment of capsaicin-sensitized afferents occurs between 35 and 42°C, as stimulations from 42°C baseline were unchanged by capsaicin. This is in line with reduced thresholds of type II A-delta mechanoheat (AMH) nociceptors following sensitization. Conventional CHEP stimulation, with a baseline temperature below 42°C, is well suited to objectively detect evidence of peripheral sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deficits in basal ganglia-based inhibitory and timing circuits along with sensorimotor internal modeling mechanisms are thought to underlie stuttering. However, much remains to be learned regarding the precise manner how these deficits contribute to disrupting both speech and cognitive functions in those who stutter. Herein, we examine the suitability of electroencephalographic (EEG) mu rhythms for addressing these deficits. We review some previous findings of mu rhythm activity differentiating stuttering from non-stuttering individuals and present some new preliminary findings capturing stuttering-related deficits in working memory. Mu rhythms are characterized by spectral peaks in alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (14–25 Hz) frequency bands (mu-alpha and mu-beta). They emanate from premotor/motor regions and are influenced by basal ganglia and sensorimotor function. More specifically, alpha peaks (mu-alpha) are sensitive to basal ganglia-based inhibitory signals and sensory-to-motor feedback. Beta peaks (mu-beta) are sensitive to changes in timing and capture motor-to-sensory (i.e., forward model) projections. Observing simultaneous changes in mu-alpha and mu-beta across the time-course of specific events provides a rich window for observing neurophysiological deficits associated with stuttering in both speech and cognitive tasks and can provide a better understanding of the functional relationship between these stuttering symptoms. We review how independent component analysis (ICA) can extract mu rhythms from raw EEG signals in speech production tasks, such that changes in alpha and beta power are mapped to myogenic activity from articulators. We review findings from speech production and auditory discrimination tasks demonstrating that mu-alpha and mu-beta are highly sensitive to capturing sensorimotor and basal ganglia deficits associated with stuttering with high temporal precision. Novel findings from a non-word repetition (working memory) task are also included. They show reduced mu-alpha suppression in a stuttering group compared to a typically fluent group. Finally, we review current limitations and directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Revealing Relationships Among Cognitive Functions Using Functional Connectivity and a Large-Scale Meta-Analysis Database</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To characterize each cognitive function per se and to understand the brain as an aggregate of those functions, it is vital to relate dozens of these functions to each other. Knowledge about the relationships among cognitive functions is informative not only for basic neuroscientific research but also for clinical applications and developments of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. In the present study, we propose an exhaustive data mining approach to reveal relationships among cognitive functions based on functional brain mapping and network analysis. We began our analysis with 109 pseudo-activation maps (cognitive function maps; CFM) that were reconstructed from a functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analysis database, each of which corresponds to one of 109 cognitive functions such as ‘emotion,’ ‘attention,’ ‘episodic memory,’ etc. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity between the CFMs, we mapped the cognitive functions onto a two-dimensional space where the relevant functions were located close to each other, which provided a rough picture of the brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis of cognitive functions using clustering of voxels in each CFM connected to the other 108 CFMs with various strengths. As a result, a CFM for each cognitive function was subdivided into several parts, each of which is strongly associated with some CFMs for a subset of the other cognitive functions, which brought in sub-concepts (i.e., sub-functions) of the cognitive function. Moreover, we conducted network analysis for the network whose nodes were parcels derived from whole-brain parcellation based on the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities. Since each parcel is characterized by associations with the 109 cognitive functions, network analyses using them are expected to inform about relationships between cognitive and network characteristics. Indeed, we found that informational diversities of interaction between parcels and densities of local connectivity were dependent on the kinds of associated functions. In addition, we identified the homogeneous and inhomogeneous network communities about the associated functions. Altogether, we suggested the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Measuring the Non-linear Directed Information Flow in Schizophrenia by Multivariate Transfer Entropy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People living with schizophrenia (SCZ) experience severe brain network deterioration. The brain is constantly fizzling with non-linear causal activities measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) and despite the variety of effective connectivity methods, only few approaches can quantify the direct non-linear causal interactions. To circumvent this problem, we are motivated to quantitatively measure the effective connectivity by multivariate transfer entropy (MTE) which has been demonstrated to be able to capture both linear and non-linear causal relationships effectively. In this work, we propose to construct the EEG effective network by MTE and further compare its performance with the Granger causal analysis (GCA) and Bivariate transfer entropy (BVTE). The simulation results quantitatively show that MTE outperformed GCA and BVTE under varied signal-to-noise conditions, edges recovered, sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, its applications to the P300 task EEG of healthy controls (HC) and SCZ patients further clearly show the deteriorated network interactions of SCZ, compared to that of the HC. The MTE provides a novel tool to potentially deepen our knowledge of the brain network deterioration of the SCZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Multiplex Neural Circuit Tracing With G-Deleted Rabies Viral Vectors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuits interconnect to organize large-scale networks that generate perception, cognition, memory, and behavior. Information in the nervous system is processed both through parallel, independent circuits and through intermixing circuits. Analyzing the interaction between circuits is particularly indispensable for elucidating how the brain functions. Monosynaptic circuit tracing with glycoprotein (G) gene-deleted rabies viral vectors (RVΔG) comprises a powerful approach for studying the structure and function of neural circuits. Pseudotyping of RVΔG with the foreign envelope EnvA permits expression of transgenes such as fluorescent proteins, genetically-encoded sensors, or optogenetic tools in cells expressing TVA, a cognate receptor for EnvA. Trans-complementation with rabies virus glycoproteins (RV-G) enables trans-synaptic labeling of input neurons directly connected to the starter neurons expressing both TVA and RV-G. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously map neuronal connections from multiple cell populations and their interactions between intermixing circuits solely with the EnvA/TVA-mediated RV tracing system in a single animal. To overcome this limitation, here, we multiplexed RVΔG circuit tracing by optimizing distinct viral envelopes (oEnvX) and their corresponding receptors (oTVX). Based on the EnvB/TVB and EnvE/DR46-TVB systems derived from the avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV), we developed optimized TVB receptors with lower or higher affinity (oTVB-L or oTVB-H) and the chimeric envelope oEnvB, as well as an optimized TVE receptor with higher affinity (oTVE-H) and its chimeric envelope oEnvE. We demonstrated independence of RVΔG infection between the oEnvA/oTVA, oEnvB/oTVB, and oEnvE/oTVE systems and in vivo proof-of-concept for multiplex circuit tracing from two distinct classes of layer 5 neurons targeting either other cortical or subcortical areas. We also successfully labeled common input of the lateral geniculate nucleus to both cortico-cortical layer 5 neurons and inhibitory neurons of the mouse V1 with multiplex RVΔG tracing. These oEnvA/oTVA, oEnvB/oTVB, and oEnvE/oTVE systems allow for differential labeling of distinct circuits to uncover the mechanisms underlying parallel processing through independent circuits and integrated processing through interaction between circuits in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cocaine Self-administration and Extinction Inversely Alter Neuron to Glia Exosomal Dynamics in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00581</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alteration of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in cocaine-seeking behaviors. Astroglial mechanisms for maintaining extracellular glutamate homeostasis through cysteine/glutamate exchanger (xCT) and glutamate transporter GLT1 are dysregulated following cocaine exposure and contribute to altered glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. However, how these astroglial proteins become dysregulated in cocaine addiction remains unknown. We recently showed that neuron to astroglial exosome signaling is essential to maintain GLT1 protein expression by transferring neuronal miR-124-3p into astrocytes to suppress GLT1-inhibiting microRNAs (miRs) in astrocytes. In the current study, by selectively labeling neuronal exosomes using CD63-GFP&lt;sup&gt;f/+&lt;/sup&gt; exosome reporter mice, we examined how the self-administration and extinction stages of the mouse cocaine self-administration model alter neuronal exosome signaling to astrocytes and microglia in the NAc. We found that cocaine (but not food) self-administration strongly reduces the internalization of neuronal exosomes, particularly in astrocytes in the NAc (but not in motor cortex), which can be effectively reversed by extinction training. In parallel, cocaine self-administration alone specifically and differentially affects activation of glial cells by decreasing GFAP expression in astrocytes but increasing Iba1 expression in microglia. However, extinction training fully reverses the increased Iba1 expression in microglia but only partially reverses the reduction of GFAP in astrocytes. Taken together, our study reveals altered in vivo dynamics of NAc neuronal exosomes in the cocaine addiction model, providing new insights about how altered neuron to glial exosome signaling may contribute to astroglial dysfunction in cocaine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mild Inactivation of RE-1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) Reduces Susceptibility to Kainic Acid-Induced Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00580</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;RE-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST) controls several steps in neural development by modulating the expression of a wide range of neural genes. Alterations in REST expression have been associated with the onset of epilepsy; however, whether such alterations are deleterious or represent a protective homeostatic response remains elusive. To study the impact of REST modulation on seizure propensity, we developed a tool for its negative modulation in vivo. The tool is composed of the paired-amphipathic helix 1 (PAH1) domain, a competitive inhibitor of REST activation by mSin3, fused to the light-oxygen-voltage sensing 2 (LOV2) domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1, a molecular switch to alternatively hide or expose the PAH1 inhibitor. We employed the C450A and I539E light-independent AsLOV2 variants to mimic the closed (inactive) and open (active) states of LOV2-PAH1, respectively. Recombinant AAV1/2 viral particles (rAAVs) allowed LOV2-PAH1 expression in HEK293T cells and primary neurons, and efficiently transduced hippocampal neurons in vivo. mRNA expression analysis revealed an increased expression of several neuronal genes in the hippocampi of mice expressing the open probe. AAV-transduced mice received a single dose of kainic acid (KA), a treatment known to induce a transient increase of REST levels in the hippocampus. Remarkably, mice expressing the active variant displayed a reduced number of KA-induced seizures, which were less severe compared to mice carrying the inactive probe. These data support the validity of our tool to modulate REST activity in vivo and the potential impact of REST modulation on epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Non-amyloidal Component Region of α-Synuclein Is Important for α-Synuclein Transport Within Axons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00540</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proper transport of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) protein, α-synuclein (α-syn), is thought to be crucial for its localization and function at the synapse. Previous work has shown that defects in long distance transport within narrow caliber axons occur early in PD, but how such defects contribute to PD is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that the NAC region is involved in facilitating proper transport of α-syn within axons via its association with membranes. Excess α-syn or fPD mutant α-syn&lt;sup&gt;A53T&lt;/sup&gt; accumulates within larval axons perturbing the transport of synaptic proteins. These α-syn expressing larvae also show synaptic morphological and larval locomotion defects, which correlate with the extent of α-syn-mediated axonal accumulations. Strikingly, deletion of the NAC region (α-syn&lt;sup&gt;Δ71–82&lt;/sup&gt;) prevented α-syn accumulations and axonal blockages, and reduced its synaptic localization due to decreased axonal entry and axonal transport of α-syn, due to less α-syn bound to membranes. Intriguingly, co-expression α-syn&lt;sup&gt;Δ71–82&lt;/sup&gt; with full-length α-syn rescued α-syn accumulations and synaptic morphological defects, and decreased the ratio of the insoluble higher molecular weight (HMW)/soluble low molecular weight (LMW) α-syn, indicating that this region is perhaps important for the dimerization of α-syn on membranes. Together, our observations suggest that under physiological conditions, α-syn associates with membranes via the NAC region, and that too much α-syn perturbs axonal transport via aggregate formation, instigating synaptic and behavioral defects seen in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Blood-Brain Barrier and Delivery of Protein and Gene Therapeutics to Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and treatment of the brain in aging require the development of new biologic drugs, such as recombinant proteins or gene therapies. Biologics are large molecule therapeutics that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB drug delivery is the limiting factor in the future development of new therapeutics for the brain. The delivery of recombinant protein or gene medicines to the brain is a binary process: either the brain drug developer re-engineers the biologic with BBB drug delivery technology, or goes forward with brain drug development in the absence of a BBB delivery platform. The presence of BBB delivery technology allows for engineering the therapeutic to enable entry into the brain across the BBB from blood. Brain drug development may still take place in the absence of BBB delivery technology, but with a reliance on approaches that have rarely led to FDA approval, e.g., CSF injection, stem cells, small molecules, and others. CSF injection of drug is the most widely practiced approach to brain delivery that bypasses the BBB. However, drug injection into the CSF results in limited drug penetration to the brain parenchyma, owing to the rapid export of CSF from the brain to blood. A CSF injection of a drug is equivalent to a slow intravenous (IV) infusion of the pharmaceutical. Given the profound effect the existence of the BBB has on brain drug development, future drug or gene development for the brain will be accelerated by future advances in BBB delivery technology in parallel with new drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Emerging Role of Sirtuin 2 in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00372</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD), the main risk factor of which is age, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, thus presenting a substantial burden on the health of affected individuals as well as an economic burden. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a subtype in the family of sirtuins, belongs to class III histone deacetylases (HDACs). It is known that SIRT2 levels increase with aging, and a growing body of evidence has been accumulating, showing that the activity of SIRT2 mediates various processes involved in PD pathogenesis, including aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn), microtubule function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy. There have been conflicting reports about the role of SIRT2 in PD, in that some studies indicate its potential to induce the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and that inhibition of SIRT2 may, therefore, have protective effects in PD. Other studies suggest a protective role of SIRT2 in the context of neuronal damage. As current treatments for PD are directed at alleviating symptoms and are very limited, a comprehensive understanding of the enzymology of SIRT2 in PD may be essential for developing novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. This review article will provide an update on our knowledge of the structure, distribution, and biological characteristics of SIRT2, and highlight its role in the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Changes in Cortical Connectivity During Surgical Anesthesia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An advanced understanding of the neurophysiologic changes that occur with aging may help improve care for older, vulnerable surgical patients. The objective of this study was to determine age-related changes in cortical connectivity patterns during surgical anesthesia. This was a substudy analysis of a prospective, observational study characterizing cortical connectivity during surgical anesthesia in adult patients (n = 45) via whole-scalp (16-channel) electroencephalography. Functional connectivity was estimated using a weighted phase lag index (wPLI), which was classified into a discrete set of states through k-means analysis. Temporal dynamics were quantified by occurrence rate and state transition probabilities. The mean global connectivity state transition probability [13.4% (±8.1)] was not correlated with age (ρ = 0.100, p = 0.513). Increasing age was inversely correlated with prefrontal-frontal alpha-beta connectivity (ρ = −0.446, p = 0.002) and positively correlated with frontal-parietal theta connectivity (ρ = 0.414, p = 0.005). After adjusting for anesthetic-related confounders, prefrontal-frontal alpha-beta connectivity remained significantly associated with age (β = −0.625, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.26; p = 0.001), while frontal-parietal theta connectivity was no longer significant (β = 0.436, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.90; p = 0.066). Specific transition states were also examined. Between frontal-parietal connectivity states, transitioning from theta-alpha to theta-dominated connectivity positively correlated with age (ρ = 0.545, p = 0.001). Dynamic connectivity states during surgical anesthesia, particularly involving alpha and theta bandwidths, maybe an informative measure to assess neurophysiologic changes that occur with aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of incurable neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ; plaques) and tau hyperphosphorylation as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain followed by neuronal death, cognitive decline, and memory loss. The high prevalence of AD in the developed world has become a major public health challenge associated with social and economic burdens on individuals and society. Due to there being limited options for early diagnosis and determining the exact pathophysiology of AD, finding effective therapeutic strategies has become a great challenge. Several possible risk factors associated with AD pathology have been identified; however, their roles are still inconclusive. Recent clinical trials of the drugs targeting Aβ and tau have failed to find a cure for the AD pathology. Therefore, effective preventive strategies should be followed to reduce the exponential increase in the prevalence of cognitive decline and dementia, especially AD. Although the search for new therapeutic targets is a great challenge for the scientific community, the roles of lifestyle interventions and nutraceuticals in the prevention of many metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases are highly appreciated in the literature. In this article, we summarize the molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathology and the possible ameliorative action of lifestyle and nutritional interventions including diet, exercise, Calorie restriction (CR), and various bioactive compounds on cognitive decline and dementia. This article will provide insights into the role of non-pharmacologic interventions in the modulation of AD pathology, which may offer the benefit of improving quality of life by reducing cognitive decline and incident AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Sleep Apnea Syndrome in an Elderly Population Admitted to a Geriatric Unit: Prevalence and Effect on Cognitive Function</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea leads to cognitive impairment in older patients, but its association with neurodegeneration remains controversial, and most studies do not distinguish between the more common obstructive form (OSAS) and the rarer central form (CSAS).&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of the different forms of sleep apnea in a cohort of cognitively impaired elderly patients (&amp;gt;70 years) and to investigate their associations with cognitive deficit, weighted against known risk factors for neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Overnight polygraphy was performed for 76 consecutive patients admitted to our geriatric unit. Their cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental-State Exam (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and Stroop test. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine associations between cognitive function and independent variables describing demographics, sleep apnea measures, and cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The cohort comprised 58 women and 18 men aged a mean of 84 years (range, 73–96). Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) was diagnosed in 48 patients (63%), of which 31 (41%) with OSAS and 17 (22%) with CSAS. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that MDRS was lower in patients with OSAS (β = −10.03, p = 0.018), that Stroop Colors and Words delays increased with AHI (β = 0.17, p = 0.030 and β = 0.31, p = 0.047) and that that Stroop Interference delay was higher in patients with CSAS (β = 24.45, p = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea is thus highly prevalent in elderly patients with cognitive impairment. OSAS was associated with lower general cognitive function, while CSAS was only associated with increased Stroop Interference delays. Elderly patients with cognitive deficit could benefit from sleep apnea screening and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Positive Allosteric Modulation of Alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Transiently Improves Memory but Aggravates Inflammation in LPS-Treated Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation accompanies or even precedes the development of cognitive changes in many brain pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, dampening inflammatory reactions within the brain is a promising strategy for supporting cognitive functions in elderly people and for preventing the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α7 subunits (α7 nAChRs) are involved in regulating cell survival, inflammation, and memory. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficiency of α7-specific therapy at different stages of inflammation and to compare the effects of orthosteric agonist PNU282987 and type 2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU120596 in mice after a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The data presented demonstrate that PNU282987 protected mice from LPS-induced impairment of episodic memory by decreasing IL-6 levels in the blood, stabilizing the brain mitochondria and up-regulating the brain α7-, α3-, and α4-containing nAChRs. Such treatment was efficient when given simultaneously with LPS or a week after LPS injection and was not efficient if LPS had been injected 2 months before. PNU120596 also decreased IL-6, stabilized mitochondria and up-regulated the brain nAChRs. However, its memory-improving effect was transient and disappeared after the end of the injection cycle. Moreover, cessation of PNU120596 treatment resulted in a sharp increase in IL-1β and IL-6 levels in the blood. It is concluded that activating α7 nAChRs protects the mouse brain from the pathogenic effect of LPS in the early stages of inflammation but is not efficient when irreversible changes have already occurred. The use of a PAM does not improve the effect of the agonist, possibly potentiates the effect of endogenous agonists, and results in undesirable effects after treatment cessation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Oncological neurosurgery relies heavily on making continuous, intra-operative tumor-brain delineations based on image-guidance. Limitations of currently available imaging techniques call for the development of real-time image-guided resection tools, which allow for reliable functional and anatomical information in an intra-operative setting. Functional ultrasound (fUS), is a new mobile neuro-imaging tool with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, which allows for the detection of small changes in blood dynamics that reflect changes in metabolic activity of activated neurons through neurovascular coupling. We have applied fUS during conventional awake brain surgery to determine its clinical potential for both intra-operative functional and vascular brain mapping, with the ultimate aim of achieving maximum safe tumor resection.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;During awake brain surgery, fUS was used to image tumor vasculature and task-evoked brain activation with electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) as a gold standard. For functional imaging, patients were presented with motor, language or visual tasks, while the probe was placed over (ESM-defined) functional brain areas. For tumor vascular imaging, tumor tissue (pre-resection) and tumor resection cavity (post-resection) were imaged by moving the hand-held probe along a continuous trajectory over the regions of interest.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 10 patients were included, with predominantly intra-parenchymal frontal and temporal lobe tumors of both low and higher histopathological grades. fUS was able to detect (ESM-defined) functional areas deep inside the brain for a range of functional tasks including language processing. Brain tissue could be imaged at a spatial and temporal resolution of 300 μm and 1.5–2.0 ms respectively, revealing real-time tumor-specific, and healthy vascular characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The current study presents the potential of applying fUS during awake brain surgery. We illustrate the relevance of fUS for awake brain surgery based on its ability to capture both task-evoked functional cortical responses as well as differences in vascular characteristics between tumor and healthy tissue. As current neurosurgical practice is still pre-dominantly leaning on inherently limited pre-operative imaging techniques for tumor resection-guidance, fUS enters the scene as a promising alternative that is both anatomically and physiologically informative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Striatum Shape Hypertrophy in Early Stage Parkinson’s Disease With Excessive Daytime Sleepiness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01353</guid>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the common and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the underlying neuropathology mechanism in PD patients with EDS (PD-EDS) remains unclear. The present study aims to delineate potential locations of structural alteration of subcortical regions in early stage and drug-naïve PD-EDS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study had 252 patients with PD and 92 matched healthy controls (HC). EDS was estimated with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with a cutoff of 10. Ultimately, 59 patients were considered as PD-EDS. The remaining 193 were PD patients without EDS (PD-nEDS). FMRIB’s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) was employed to assess the volumetric and surface alterations of subcortical nuclei in PD and PD-EDS.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Volumetric analyses found no difference in the subcortical nucleus volume between PD and HC, or PD-EDS and PD-nEDS groups. The shape analyses revealed the local atrophic changes in bilateral caudate and right putamen in patients with PD. In addition, the hypertrophic changes were located in the right putamen and left pallidum in PD-EDS than in PD-nEDS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed the regional hypertrophy of the striatum in PD-EDS. Our results indicate that local hypertrophic striatum would be a valuable early biomarker for detecting the alteration in PD-EDS. The shape analysis contributes valuable information when investigating PD-EDS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Principles of Mutual Information Maximization and Energy Minimization Affect the Activation Patterns of Large Scale Networks in the Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Successive patterns of activation and deactivation in local areas of the brain indicate the mechanisms of information processing in the brain. It is possible that this process can be optimized by principles, such as the maximization of mutual information and the minimization of energy consumption. In the present paper, I showed evidence for this argument by demonstrating the correlation among mutual information, the energy of the activation, and the activation patterns. Modeling the information processing based on the functional connectome datasets of the human brain, I simulated information transfer in this network structure. Evaluating the statistical quantities of the different network states, I clarified the correlation between them. First, I showed that mutual information and network energy have a close relationship, and that the values are maximized and minimized around a same network state. This implies that there is an optimal network state in the brain that is organized according to the principles regarding mutual information and energy. On the other hand, the evaluation of the network structure revealed that the characteristic network structure known as the criticality also emerges around this state. These results imply that the characteristic features of the functional network are also affected strongly by these principles. To assess the functional aspects of this state, I investigated the output activation patterns in response to random input stimuli. Measuring the redundancy of the responses in terms of the number of overlapping activation patterns, the results indicate that there is a negative correlation between mutual information and the redundancy in the patterns, suggesting that there is a trade-off between communication efficiency and robustness due to redundancy, and the principles of mutual information and network energy are important to network formation and its function in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Neuro-hormonal Regulation Is a Better Indicator of Human Cognitive Abilities Than Brain Anatomy: The Need for a New Paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human intelligence has been theorized since the ancient Greeks. Plato and Aristotle incorporated theories of human intelligence into their metaphysical and cosmological theories which informed the social and medical sciences for centuries. With the advent of the 20th century, human intelligence became increasingly standardized based on Intelligence Quotients (IQ). Moreover, multiple theories of human intelligence were posited on morphological features of the human brain, focusing on cranial volume and size of the pre-frontal cortex which was suggestive of superior human cognitive abilities. This article argues that fixation with anatomical features of the brain was tended to ignore the importance of neuro-hormonal regulation which is a more appropriate indicator of human cognitive abilities. The article challenges the correlation between brain size and human cognitive abilities while offering an alternate theory of human cognitive abilities which emphasizes the roles of neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and enteric gut microbiome (EGM) regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Relationship Between Risk Factors and Brain Reserve in Late Middle Age: Implications for Cognitive Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00355</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00355</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Brain reserve can be defined as the individual variation in the brain structural characteristics that later in life are likely to modulate cognitive performance. Late midlife represents a point in aging where some structural brain imaging changes have become manifest but the effects of cognitive aging are minimal, and thus may represent an ideal opportunity to determine the relationship between risk factors and brain imaging biomarkers of reserve.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess neuroimaging measures from multiple modalities to broaden our understanding of brain reserve, and the late midlife risk factors that may make the brain vulnerable to age related cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined multimodal [structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), FDG PET] neuroimaging measures in 50–65 year olds to examine the associations between risk factors (Intellectual/Physical Activity: education-occupation composite, physical, and cognitive-based activity engagement; General Health Factors: presence of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC), body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, smoking status (ever/never), CAGE Alcohol Questionnaire (&amp;gt;2, yes/no), Beck Depression Inventory score), brain reserve measures [Dynamic: genu corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (FA), posterior cingulate cortex FDG uptake, superior parietal cortex thickness, AD signature cortical thickness; Static: intracranial volume], and cognition (global, memory, attention, language, visuospatial) from a population-based sample. We quantified dynamic proxies of brain reserve (cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, microstructural integrity) and investigated various protective/risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Education-occupation was associated with cognition and total intracranial volume (static measure of brain reserve), but was not associated with any of the dynamic neuroimaging biomarkers. In contrast, many general health factors were associated with the dynamic neuroimaging proxies of brain reserve, while most were not associated with cognition in this late middle aged group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Brain reserve, as exemplified by the four dynamic neuroimaging features studied here, is itself at least partly influenced by general health status in midlife, but may be largely independent of education and occupation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Volume-Conducted Origin of the Field Potential at the Lateral Habenula</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00078</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00078</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Field potentials (FPs) are easily reached signals that provide information about the brain’s processing. However, FP should be interpreted cautiously since their biophysical bases are complex. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain structure involved in the encoding of aversive motivational values. Previous work indicates that the activity of the LHb is relevant for hippocampal-dependent learning. Moreover, it has been proposed that the interaction of the LHb with the hippocampal network is evidenced by the synchronization of LHb and hippocampal FPs during theta rhythm. However, the origin of the habenular FP has not been analyzed. Hence, its validity as a measurement of LHb activity has not been proven. In this work, we used electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats and feed-forward modeling to investigate biophysical basis of the FP recorded in the LHb. Our results indicate that the FP in the LHb during theta rhythm is a volume-conducted signal from the hippocampus. This result highlight that FPs must be thoroughly analyzed before its biological interpretation and argues against the use of the habenular FP signal as a readout of the activity of the LHb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown etiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson’s and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point toward synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Comparison of Functional Networks Derived From Representational Similarity, Functional Connectivity, and Univariate Analyses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01348</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The invention of representational similarity analysis [RSA, following multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)] has allowed cognitive neuroscientists to identify the representational structure of multiple brain regions, moving beyond functional localization. By comparing these structures, cognitive neuroscientists can characterize how brain areas form functional networks. Univariate analysis (UNIVAR) and functional connectivity analysis (FCA) are two other popular methods to identify functional networks. Despite their popularity, few studies have examined the relationship between networks from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA. Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the similarities between neural networks derived from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA to explore how these methods relate to each other. We analyzed the data of a previously published study with the three methods and compared the results by performing (partial) correlation and multiple regression analysis. Our findings reveal that neural networks resulting from RSA, UNIVAR, and FCA methods are highly similar to each other even after ruling out the effect of anatomical proximity between the network nodes. Nevertheless, the neural network from each method shows unique organization that cannot be explained by any of the other methods. Thus, we conclude that the RSA, UNIVAR and FCA methods provide similar but not identical information on how brain regions are organized in functional networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Reelin Immunoreactivity in the Adult Spinal Cord: A Comparative Study in Rodents, Carnivores, and Non-human Primates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00102</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reelin is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein secreted by several neuronal populations in a specific manner in both the developing and the adult central nervous system. The extent of Reelin protein distribution and its functional role in the adult neocortex is well documented in different mammal models. However, its role in the adult spinal cord has not been well characterized and its distribution in the rodent spinal cord is fragmentary and has not been investigated in carnivores or primates as of yet. To gain insight into which neuronal populations and specific circuits may be influenced by Reelin in the adult spinal cord, we have conducted light and confocal microscopy study analysis of Reelin-immunoreactive cell types in the adult spinal cord. Here, we describe and compare Reelin immunoreactive cell type and distribution in the spinal cord of adult non-human primate (macaque monkeys, Macaca mulatta), carnivore (ferret, Mustela putorius) and rodent (rat, Rattus norvegicus). Our results show that in all three species studied, Reelin-immunoreactive neurons are present in the intermediate gray matter, ventricular zone and superficial dorsal horn and intermedio-lateral nucleus, while positive cells in the Clarke nucleus are only found in rats and primates. In addition, Reelin intermediolateral neurons colocalize with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) only in macaque whilst motor neurons also colocalize Reelin and ChAT in macaque, ferret and rat spinal cord. The different expression patterns might reflect a differential role for Reelin in the pathways involved in the coordination of locomotor activity in the fore- and hind limbs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: m6A mRNA Methylation Is Essential for Oligodendrocyte Maturation and CNS Myelination</title>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)31055-4?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Xu et al. show that oligodendrocyte development is associated with dynamic changes in posttranscriptional mRNA methylation. Moreover, they demonstrate that the m6A epigenetic RNA mark has considerable impact on the myelinating cell’s transcriptome and is essential for normal CNS myelination.</description>

In the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; larva, the activity of a single olfactory sensory neuron is sufficient to direct accurate reorientation maneuvers in odor gradients (chemotaxis). In this reduced sensory system, a descending pathway essential for larval chemotaxis has been delineated from the peripheral olfactory system down to the premotor system. Here, I review how anatomical and functional inspections of this pathway have advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms that convert behaviorally relevant sensory signals into orientation responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Currier, Katherine I. Nagel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial navigation is influenced by cues from nearly every sensory modality and thus provides an excellent model for understanding how different sensory streams are integrated to drive behavior. Here we review recent work on multisensory control of navigation in the model organism &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;, which allows for detailed circuit dissection. We identify four modes of integration that have been described in the literature—suppression, gating, summation, and association—and describe regions of the larval and adult brain that have been implicated in sensory integration. Finally we discuss what circuit architectures might support these different forms of integration. We argue that &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent model to discover these circuit and biophysical motifs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: An Integrative Model of Effortful Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00079</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00079</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article presents an integrative model of effortful control, a resource-limited top-down control mechanism involved in mental tasks and physical exercises. Based on recent findings in the fields of neuroscience, social psychology and cognitive psychology, this model posits the intrinsic costs related to a weakening of the connectivity of neural networks underpinning effortful control as the main cause of mental fatigue in long and high-demanding tasks. In this framework, effort reflects three different inter-related aspects of the same construct. First, effort is a mechanism comprising a limited number of interconnected processing units that integrate information regarding the task constraints and subject’s state. Second, effort is the main output of this mechanism, namely, the effort signal that modulates neuronal activity in brain regions involved in the current task to select pertinent information. Third, effort is a feeling that emerges in awareness during effortful tasks and reflects the costs associated with goal-directed behavior. Finally, the model opens new avenues for research investigating effortful control at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal firing rate variability prior to movement onset contributes to trial-to-trial variability in primate behavior. However, in humans, whether similar mechanisms contribute to trial-to-trial behavioral variability remains unknown. We investigated the time-course of trial-to-trial variability in corticospinal excitability (CSE) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a self-paced reach-to-grasp task. We hypothesized that CSE variability will be modulated prior to the initiation of reach and that such a modulation would explain trial-to-trial behavioral variability. Able-bodied individuals were visually cued to plan their grip force before exertion of either 30% or 5% of their maximum pinch force capacity on an object. TMS was delivered at six time points (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 s) following a visual cue that instructed the force level. We first modeled the relation between CSE magnitude and its variability at rest (n = 12) to study the component of CSE variability pertaining to the task but not related to changes in CSE magnitude (n = 12). We found an increase in CSE variability from 1.2 to 1.3 s following the visual cue at 30% but not at 5% of force. This effect was temporally dissociated from the decrease in CSE magnitude that was observed from 0.5 to 0.75 s following the cue. Importantly, the increase in CSE variability explained at least ∼40% of inter-individual differences in trial-to-trial variability in time to peak force rate. These results were found to be repeatable across studies and robust to different analysis methods. Our findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying modulation in CSE variability and CSE magnitude are distinct. Notably, the extent of modulation in variability in corticospinal system prior to grasp within individuals may explain their trial-to-trial behavioral variability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Morphine Differentially Alters the Synaptic and Intrinsic Properties of D1R- and D2R-Expressing Medium Spiny Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to opioids reshapes future reward and motivated behaviors partially by altering the functional output of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens shell. Here, we investigated how morphine, a highly addictive opioid, alters synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability on dopamine D1-receptor (D1R) expressing and dopamine D2-receptor (D2R) expressing MSNs, the two main output neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using whole-cell electrophysiology recordings, we show, that 24 h abstinence following repeated non-contingent administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice reduces the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency on D2R-MSNs, with concomitant increases in D2R-MSN intrinsic membrane excitability. We did not observe any changes in synaptic or intrinsic changes on D1R-MSNs. Last, in an attempt to determine the integrated effect of the synaptic and intrinsic alterations on the overall functional output of D2R-MSNs, we measured the input-output efficacy by measuring synaptically-driven action potential firing. We found that both D1R-MSN and D2R-MSN output was unchanged following morphine treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sickness behavior is a set of behavioral changes induced by infections and mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is characterized by fatigue, decreased appetite and weight loss, changes in sleep patterns, cognitive functions, and lost interest in social activity. It can expedite recovery by conserving energy to mount an immune response involving innate immunity. To provide insights into microglial implication in sickness behavior with special focus on cognitive and social impairment, we investigated changes in their ultrastructure and interactions with synapses using a toxemia mouse model. Adult mice were injected with 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline, and assayed for signs of sickness behavior. LPS treated mice displayed reduced activity in open-field tests 24 h post-injection, while social avoidance and weight gain/loss were not significantly different between treatment groups. Microglia were investigated using electron microscopy to describe changes in their structure and function at nanoscale resolution. Microglial cell bodies and processes were investigated in the hippocampus CA1, a region responsible for learning and memory that is often impacted after peripheral LPS administration. Microglia in LPS treated animals displayed larger cell bodies as well as less complex processes at the time point examined. Strikingly, microglial processes in LPS injected animals were also more likely to contact excitatory synapses and contained more phagocytic material compared with saline injected controls. We have identified at the ultrastructural level significant changes in microglia-synapse interactions shortly after LPS administration, which draws attention to studying the roles of microglia in synaptic rewiring after inflammatory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multi-Disease Segmentation of Gliomas and White Matter Hyperintensities in the BraTS Data Using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An important challenge in segmenting real-world biomedical imaging data is the presence of multiple disease processes within individual subjects. Most adults above age 60 exhibit a variable degree of small vessel ischemic disease, as well as chronic infarcts, which will manifest as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain MRIs. Subjects diagnosed with gliomas will also typically exhibit some degree of abnormal T2 signal due to WMH, rather than just due to tumor. We sought to develop a fully automated algorithm to distinguish and quantify these distinct disease processes within individual subjects’ brain MRIs. To address this multi-disease problem, we trained a 3D U-Net to distinguish between abnormal signal arising from tumors vs. WMH in the 3D multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI, i.e., native T1-weighted, T1-post-contrast, T2, T2-FLAIR) scans of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 dataset (n&lt;sub&gt;training&lt;/sub&gt; = 285, n&lt;sub&gt;validation&lt;/sub&gt; = 66). Our trained neuroradiologist manually annotated WMH on the BraTS training subjects, finding that 69% of subjects had WMH. Our 3D U-Net model had a 4-channel 3D input patch (80 × 80 × 80) from mpMRI, four encoding and decoding layers, and an output of either four [background, active tumor (AT), necrotic core (NCR), peritumoral edematous/infiltrated tissue (ED)] or five classes (adding WMH as the fifth class). For both the four- and five-class output models, the median Dice for whole tumor (WT) extent (i.e., union of AT, ED, NCR) was 0.92 in both training and validation sets. Notably, the five-class model achieved significantly (p = 0.002) lower/better Hausdorff distances for WT extent in the training subjects. There was strong positive correlation between manually segmented and predicted volumes for WT (r = 0.96) and WMH (r = 0.89). Larger lesion volumes were positively correlated with higher/better Dice scores for WT (r = 0.33), WMH (r = 0.34), and across all lesions (r = 0.89) on a log(10) transformed scale. While the median Dice for WMH was 0.42 across training subjects with WMH, the median Dice was 0.62 for those with at least 5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of WMH. We anticipate the development of computational algorithms that are able to model multiple diseases within a single subject will be a critical step toward translating and integrating artificial intelligence systems into the heterogeneous real-world clinical workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Prism Method for Optical Glomerular Mapping of the Medial Olfactory Bulb in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The processing of odor input in the brain begins in the olfactory bulb (OB), where odor information is represented by combinations of active glomeruli. Each glomerulus is associated with a specific odorant receptor type, of which there are ~1,000 in mice; thus different odors activate different subsets of glomeruli. Most receptor types have duplicate lateral and medial glomeruli in each of the left and right OBs. The two sets of glomeruli form separate but mirror-symmetric glomerular maps. It is not known whether the odor representations in these paired maps are exact copies of each other or potentially encode additional information. Previous studies of glomerular odor representations were mostly limited to the lateral map because the medial map is inaccessible with high-resolution activity mapping techniques, such as optical imaging. To address this, we developed a method for optical imaging of the medial bulb by replacing the contralateral bulb with a right-angle prism that has a mirror coating on the hypotenuse. With this method, we performed calcium imaging of corresponding subsets of glomeruli in the lateral map at the dorsal surface and the medial map at the medial wall. Thus, we demonstrate an experimental model system for comparing odor representations in these redundant sensory maps, enabling a better understanding of the role of paired maps and the neuronal coding of odor stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Changes of Glutamate and GABA Receptor Densities in Wistar Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitters and their receptors are key molecules of signal transduction and subject to various changes during pre- and postnatal development. Previous studies addressed ontogeny at the level of neurotransmitters and expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits. However, developmental changes in receptor densities to this day are not well understood. Here, we analyzed developmental changes in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in adjacent sections of the rat brain by means of quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Receptor densities of the ionotropic glutamatergic receptors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as well as of the ionotropic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and metabotropic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were investigated using specific high-affinity ligands. For each receptor binding site, significant density differences were demonstrated in the investigated regions of interest [olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum] and developmental stages [postnatal day (P) 0, 10, 20, 30 and 90]. In particular, we showed that the glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor densities were already present between P0 and P10 in all regions of interest, which may indicate the early relevance of these receptors for brain development. A transient increase of glutamatergic receptor densities in the hippocampus was found, indicating their possible involvement in synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated a decline of NMDA receptor densities in the striatum and hippocampus from P30 to P90, which could be due to synapse elimination, a process that redefines neuronal networks in postnatal brains. Furthermore, the highest increase in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor densities from P10 to P20 coincides with the developmental shift from excitatory to inhibitory GABA transmission. Moreover, the increase from P10 to P20 in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor densities in the cerebellum corresponds to a point in time when functional GABAergic synapses are formed. Taken together, the present data reveal differential changes in glutamate and GABA receptor densities during postnatal rat brain development, which may contribute to their specific functions during ontogenesis, thus providing a deeper understanding of brain ontogenesis and receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Associated phenomena, such as cell loss and synapse loss, are evaluated but not staged. This article reviews the development of neuropathological staging of the sporadic Alzheimer’s and sporadic Parkinson’s diseases. It considers challenges for staging systems, and it poses the question whether neuropathological staging as practiced up to now is still relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Thanks to the systematic use of high-throughput approaches over the last 10 years, more than 40 genes/loci have been linked to the AD risk. Although some of these signals are likely to be false positives, this genetic knowledge has shed new light on the pathogenesis of AD and, in particular, the major role of microglia. However, our knowledge of the genetics of AD is far from complete, and larger and more diverse genetic studies are required. Lastly, post-GWAS analyses will be needed to make sense of this genetic information without focusing too much on what we think we know about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Increasing evidence shows that aggregation-prone proteins such as tau, α-synuclein and TDP-43 are accumulated in a seed-dependent and self-templating manner &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting that pathological protein aggregates found in these diseases function like abnormal prion protein. Indeed, insoluble tau and α-synuclein aggregates are transferred from cell to cell both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, indicating that prion-like propagation of aberrant protein aggregates may play a key role in the pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we will review the prion-like properties of TDP-43, and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the propagation of these accumulated proteins. The idea that aberrant protein aggregates propagate in a prion-like manner between cells opens up the possibility of novel therapeutic strategies to block the spread of these aggregates throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Altered Topological Organization in the Sensorimotor Network After Application of Different Frequency rTMS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) could influence the intrinsic brain activity in the sensorimotor network (SMN). However, how rTMS modulates the topological organization of the SMN remains unclear. In this study, we employed resting-state fMRI to investigate the topological alterations in the functional SMN after application of different frequency rTMS over the left M1. To accomplish this, we collected MRI data from 45 healthy participants who were randomly divided into three groups based on rTMS frequency (HF, high-frequency 3 Hz; LF, low-frequency 1 Hz; and SHAM). Individual large-scale functional SMN was constructed by correlating the mean time series among 29 regions of interest (ROI) in the SMN and was fed into graph-based network analyses at multiple levels of global organization and nodal centrality. Our results showed that compared with the network metrics before rTMS stimulation, the left paracentral lobule (PCL) exhibited reduced nodal degree and betweenness centrality in the LF group after rTMS, while the right supplementary motor area (SMA) exhibited reduced nodal betweenness centrality in the HF group after rTMS. Moreover, rTMS-related alterations in nodal metrics might have been attributable to the changes in connectivity patterns and local activity of the affected nodes. These findings reflected the potential of using rTMS over M1 as an effective intervention to promote motor function rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Tongue Force Training Induces Plasticity of the Lingual Motor Cortex in Young Adult and Aged Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tongue exercise programs are used clinically for dysphagia in aged individuals and have been shown to improve lingual strength. However, the neural mechanisms of age-related decline in swallowing function and its association with lingual strength are not well understood. Using an established rat model of aging and tongue exercise, we hypothesized that the motor cortex of aged rats would have a smaller lingual motor map area than young adult rats and would increase in size as a function of tongue exercise. Over 8 weeks, rats either underwent a progressive resistance tongue exercise program (TE), learned the task but did not exercise (trained controls, TC), or were naïve untrained controls (UC). Cortical motor map areas for tongue and jaw were determined using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). Rats in the TE and TC groups had a significantly larger motor cortex region for the tongue than the UC group. Lingual cortical motor area was not correlated with protrusive tongue force gains and did not differ significantly with age. These results suggest that learning a novel tongue force skill was sufficient to induce plasticity of the lingual motor cortex yet increasing tongue strength with progressive resistance exercise did not significantly expand the lingual motor area beyond the gains that occurred through the skilled learning component.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Subregional Density of Neurons, Neurofibrillary Tangles and Amyloid Plaques in the Hippocampus of Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A variety of anatomical alterations have been reported in the hippocampal formation of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and these alterations have been correlated with cognitive symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Major hallmarks in AD are the presence of paired helical filaments of tau protein (PHF&lt;sub&gt;Tau&lt;/sub&gt;) within neurons, also known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and aggregates of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) which form plaques in the extracellular space. Nevertheless, how the density of plaques and NFTs relate to the severity of cell loss and cognitive decline is not yet clear. The aim of the present study was to further examine the possible relationship of both Aβ plaques and NFTs with neuronal loss in several hippocampal fields (DG, CA3, CA1, and subiculum) of 11 demented AD patients. For this purpose, using stereological techniques, we compared neuronal densities (Nissl-stained, and immunoreactive neurons for NeuN) with: (i) numbers of neurons immunostained for two isoforms of PHF&lt;sub&gt;Tau&lt;/sub&gt; (PHF&lt;sub&gt;Tau-AT8&lt;/sub&gt; and PHF&lt;sub&gt;Tau-pS396&lt;/sub&gt;); and (ii) number of Aβ plaques. We found that CA1 showed the highest number of NFTs and Aβ plaques, whereas DG and CA3 displayed the lowest number of these markers. Furthermore, AD patients showed a variable neuronal loss in CA1 due to tangle-related cell death, which seems to correlate with the presence of extracellular tangles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
