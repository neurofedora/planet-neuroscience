	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin&lt;br /&gt; Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: October 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Robert R   Rozeske, Cyril   Herry&lt;br /&gt; The behavioral repertoire of an organism can be highly diverse, spanning from social to defensive. How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Their morphology and density change throughout life, reflecting the maturation and reorganization of excitatory circuits. The development of in vivo two-photon microscopy has enabled the monitoring of the same dendritic spines over time during different developmental periods. In this review we focus on recent in vivo imaging studies in rodents that have revealed cell type-specific and region-specific structural dynamics of dendritic spines. We also discuss how the contributions of local inhibitory neurons and long-distance excitatory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex influence dendritic spine development and dynamics. Such studies will facilitate our understanding of how environmental factors and experiences affect cortical synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne&lt;br /&gt; Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies of female specific behaviors have remained niche, but the focus is changing as illustrated by the recent progress in understanding the female courtship responses and egg-laying decisions. In this review, we will cover our current knowledge about female behaviors in these two specific contexts. Recent studies elucidate on how females process the courtship song. They also show that egg-laying decisions are extremely complex, requiring the assessment of food, microbial, predator and social cues. Study of female responses will improve our understanding of how a nervous system processes different challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Erzurumlu&lt;br /&gt; Molecular identification of neuronal types and genetic and imaging approaches to characterize their properties reveal morphological, physiological and dynamic aspects of sensory circuit development. Here we focus on the mouse tactile sensory circuitry, with particular emphasis on the main trigeminal pathway that connects the whiskers, the major tactile organ in rodents, to the neocortex. At each level of this pathway, neurogenesis, axonal elongation, pathfinding, target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</description>

	<description>In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Spreading of Tau Pathology in Sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease Along Cortico-cortical Top-Down Connections</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I–IV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Parvalbumin Interneurons Shape Neuronal Vulnerability in Blunt TBI</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The C. elegans AWA Olfactory Neuron Fires Calcium-Mediated All-or-None Action Potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359935v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359935v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We find, unexpectedly, that C. elegans neurons can encode information through regenerative all-or-none action potentials. In particular, AWA olfactory neurons generate membrane potential spikes with defining characteristics of action potentials. Ion substitution experiments, pharmacology, and mutant analysis identified a voltage-gated CaV1 calcium channel and a Shaker-type potassium channel that underlie action potential dynamics in AWA. Additional potassium channels are predicted by simulation of AWA action potentials with Hodgkin-Huxley and bifurcation models. Simultaneous patch-clamp recording and calcium imaging in AWA revealed spike-associated calcium signals that were also observed after odor stimulation of intact animals, suggesting that natural odor stimuli induce AWA action potentials. The stimulus regimes that elicited action potentials match AWA's proposed specialized function in climbing odor gradients. Our results provide evidence that C. elegans can use digital as well as analog coding schemes, expand the computational repertoire of its nervous system, and inform future modeling of its neural coding and network dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reduced gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex is associated with greater body mass index: a coordinate-based meta-analysis.</title>

	<description>Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies have not found a clear relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and obesity, despite animal and human studies suggesting the contrary. Our primary meta-analysis examined what regions are associated with reduced gray matter volume, given increased body mass index. We identified 23 voxel-based morphometry studies examining the association between gray matter volume and body mass index. In a sample of 6,788 participants, we found that greater body mass index is associated with decreased gray matter volume in the right Brodmanns area 10 and 11, forming part of the right orbitofrontal cortex (FWE, p=0.05). Use of Brodmanns areas 10 and 11 as seeds in a Neurosynth network coactivation and text decoding analysis revealed that these regions are associated with studies of emotional regulation and processing, clinical symptoms and disorder, mentalizing and social cognition, and the Default mode network. Our finding uniquely contributes to the literature in showing a relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and obesity and showing the wide-ranging impact these differences may have on social, mental, and emotional functioning as well as on the Default mode network. Exploratory analyses suggest the need for studies examining the effect of age on these findings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Calcium-dependent reactive oxygen formation and blood-brain barrier breakdown by NOX5 limits post-reperfusion outcome in stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359893v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359893v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Ischemic stroke is a predominant cause of disability worldwide, with thrombolytic or mechanical removal of the occlusion being the only therapeutic options. Reperfusion bears the risk of an acute deleterious calcium-dependent breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier. Its mechanism, however, is unknown. Here we identify type 5 NADPH oxidase (NOX5), a calcium-activated, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-forming enzyme as missing link. Using a humanised knock-in mouse model and in vitro in organotypic cultures, we find re-oxygenation or calcium overload to increase brain ROS levels in a NOX5-dependent manner. In vivo, post-ischemic ROS formation, infarct volume and functional outcomes were worsened in NOX5 knock-in mice. Of clinical and therapeutic relevance, in a human blood-barrier model pharmacological NOX inhibition also prevented acute re-oxygenation induced leakage. Our data therefore identify NOX5 as sufficient to induce acute post-reperfusion calcium-dependent blood-brain-barrier breakdown. We suggest urgent clinical validation by conducting protective post-stroke re-canalisation in the presence of a NOX inhibitor.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effect of chronic stimulation and stimulus level on temporal processing by cochlear implant listeners</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359869v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359869v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A series of experiments investigated potential changes in temporal processing during the months following activation of a cochlear implant (CI) and as a function of stimulus level. Experiment 1 tested patients on the day of implant activation and two and six months later. All stimuli were presented using direct stimulation of a single apical electrode. The dependent variables were rate discrimination ratios (RDRs) for pulse trains with rates centred on 120 pulses per second (pps), obtained using an adaptive procedure, and a measure of the upper limit of temporal pitch, obtained using a pitchranking procedure. All stimuli were presented at their most comfortable level (MCL). RDRs decreased from 1.23 to 1.16 and the upper limit increased from 357 to 485 pps from 0 to 2 months post-activation, with no overall change from 2 to 6 months. Because MCLs and hence the testing level increased across sessions, two further experiments investigated whether the performance changes observed across sessions could be due to level differences. Experiment 2 re-tested a subset of subjects at 9 months postactivation, using current levels similar to those used at 0 months. Although the stimuli sounded softer, some subjects showed lower RDRs and/or higher upper limits at this re-test. Experiment 3 measured RDRs and the upper limit for a separate group of subjects at levels equal to 60%, 80%, and 100% of the dynamic range. RDRs decreased with increasing level. The upper limit increased with increasing level for most subjects, with two notable exceptions. Implications of the results for temporal plasticity are discussed, along with possible influences of the effects of level and of across-session learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The transfer function of the rhesus macaque oculomotor system for small-amplitude slow motion trajectories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359836v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Two main types of small eye movements occur during gaze fixation: microsaccades and slow ocular drifts. While microsaccade generation has been relatively well-studied, ocular drift control mechanisms are unknown. Here we explored the degree to which monkey smooth eye movements, on the velocity scale of slow ocular drifts, can be generated systematically. Two male rhesus macaque monkeys tracked a spot moving sinusoidally, but slowly, along the horizontal or vertical directions. Maximum target displacement in the motion trajectory was 30 min arc (0.5 deg), and we varied the temporal frequency of target motion from 0.1 to 5 Hz. We obtained an oculomotor transfer function by measuring smooth eye velocity gain (relative to target velocity) as a function of frequency, similar to past work with large-amplitude pursuit. Monkey eye velocities as slow as those observed during slow ocular drifts were clearly target-motion driven. Moreover, like with large-amplitude smooth pursuit, eye velocity gain varied with temporal frequency. However, unlike with large-amplitude pursuit, exhibiting primarily low-pass behavior, small-amplitude motion tracking was band-pass with the best ocular movement gain occurring at ~0.8-1 Hz. When oblique directions were tested, we found that monkey oblique pursuit gain for small-amplitude slow motion trajectories was &amp;gt;1. Our results provide a catalogue of the control abilities of the monkey oculomotor system for slow target motions, and they also support the notion that smooth fixational ocular drifts are controllable. This has implications for neural investigations of drift control and the image-motion consequences of drifts on visual coding in early visual areas.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortical responses to natural speech reflect probabilistic phonotactics</title>

	<description>Humans comprehend speech despite the various challenges of real-world environments, such as loud noise and mispronunciation. Our auditory system is robust to these thanks to the integration of the upcoming sensory input with prior knowledge and expectations built on language-specific regularities. One such regularity regards the permissible phoneme sequences, which determine the likelihood that a word belongs to a given language (phonotactic probability; 'blick' is more likely to be an English word than 'bnick'). Previous research suggested that violations of these rules modulate brain evoked responses such as the N400 and the late positive complex. Yet several fundamental questions remain unresolved, especially regarding the neural encoding and integration strategy of phonotactic information. Here, we used linear modelling approaches to assess the influence of phonotactic probabilities on the brain responses to narrative speech measured with non-invasive EEG. We found that the relationship between continuous speech and EEG responses is best described when the speech descriptor includes phonotactic probabilities. This provides us with a methodology to isolate and measure the brain responses to phonotactics using natural speech at the individual subject-level. Furthermore, such low-frequency signals showed the strongest speech-EEG interactions at latencies of 100-400 ms, supporting a pre-lexical role of phonotactic information.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computation predicts rapidly adapting mechanotransduction currents cannot account for tactile encoding in Merkel cell-neurite complexes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gregory J. Gerling, Lingtian Wan, Benjamin U. Hoffman, Yuxiang Wang, Ellen A. Lumpkin&lt;/p&gt;

Distinct firing properties among touch receptors are influenced by multiple, interworking anatomical structures. Our understanding of the functions and crosstalk of Merkel cells and their associated neurites—the end organs of slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents—remains incomplete. Piezo2 mechanically activated channels are required both in Merkel cells and in sensory neurons for canonical SAI responses in rodents; however, a central unanswered question is how rapidly inactivating currents give rise to sustained action potential volleys in SAI afferents. The computational model herein synthesizes mechanotransduction currents originating from Merkel cells and neurites, in context of skin mechanics and neural dynamics. Its goal is to mimic distinct spike firing patterns from wildtype animals, as well as &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals that completely lack Merkel cells. The developed generator function includes a Merkel cell mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents and downstream voltage-activated conductances (slower decay of current) and a neurite mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents (faster decay of current). To mimic sustained firing in wildtype animals, a longer time constant was needed than the 200 ms observed for mechanically activated membrane depolarizations in rodent Merkel cells. One mechanism that suffices is to introduce an ultra-slowly inactivating current, with a time constant on the order of 1.7 s. This mechanism may drive the slow adaptation of the sustained response, for which the skin’s viscoelastic relaxation cannot account. Positioned within the sensory neuron, this source of current reconciles the physiology and anatomical characteristics of &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN0hi7HylwE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Extracting the statistics of event streams in natural environments is critical for interpreting current events and predicting future ones. The brain is known to rapidly find structure and meaning in unfamiliar streams of sensory experience, often by mere exposure to the environment (i.e. without explicit feedback). Yet, we know little about the brain pathways that support this type of statistical learning. Here, we test whether changes in white-matter connectivity due to training relate to our ability to extract temporal regularities. By combining behavioral training and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), we demonstrate that humans adapt to the environment’s statistics as they change over time from simple repetition to probabilistic combinations. In particular, we show that learning relates to the decision strategy that individuals adopt when extracting temporal statistics. We next test for learning-dependent changes in white-matter connectivity and ask whether they relate to individual variability in decision strategy. Our DTI results provide evidence for dissociable white-matter pathways that relate to individual strategy: extracting the exact sequence statistics (i.e. matching) relates to connectivity changes between caudate and hippocampus, while selecting the most probable outcomes in a given context (i.e. maximizing) relates to connectivity changes between prefrontal, cingulate and basal ganglia (caudate, putamen) regions. Thus, our findings provide evidence for distinct cortico-striatal circuits that show learning-dependent changes of white-matter connectivity and support individual ability to learn behaviorally-relevant statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Training is known to improve performance in a range of sensory-motor tasks and alter white-matter connectivity, as measured by Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI). Yet, learning to extract the statistics of event streams in natural environments is thought to often occur without explicit feedback (i.e. by mere exposure to the environment). Here, we demonstrate that this type of statistical learning of temporal structures without trial-by-trial feedback relates to changes in white-matter connectivity in the human brain. Our findings provide evidence for distinct cortico-striatal circuits that support individual ability to learn behaviorally-relevant statistics. In particular, individuals engage dissociable structural brain networks depending on their decision strategy, suggesting alternate brain routes to learning predictive structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neural systems integrate, encode, and compute information is central to understanding brain function. Frequently, data from neuroscience experiments are multivariate, the interactions between the variables are non-linear, and the landscape of hypothesized or possible interactions between variables is extremely broad. Information theory is well suited to address these types of data as it possesses multivariate analysis tools, it can be applied to many different types of data, it can capture non-linear interactions, and it does not require assumptions about the structure of the underlying data (i.e., it is model independent). In this article, we walk through the mathematics of information theory along with common logistical problems associated with data type, data binning, data quantity requirements, bias, and significance testing. Next, we analyze models inspired by canonical neuroscience experiments to improve understanding and demonstrate the strengths of information theory analyses. To facilitate the use of information theory analyses, and an understanding of how these analyses are implemented, we also provide a free MATLAB software package that can be applied to a wide range of data from neuroscience experiments, as well as from other fields of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A primary function of the brain is to process and store information. Therefore, it makes sense to analyze the behavior of the brain using information theory, a statistical tool especially designed to quantify information. Furthermore, given improvements in data gathering techniques, the power of information theory to analyze large, complex data sets is particularly relevant. In this tutorial, we provide a thorough introduction to information theory and how it can be applied to data gathered from the brain. Our primary audience for this tutorial is researchers new to information theory. We provide numerous intuitive examples including small abstract systems, small and large brain circuits, systems from famous neuroscience experiments, and free software to implement all calculations and models presented herein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Age-Related Declines in Prefrontal Cortical Expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors that Support Working Memory</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Glutamate signaling is essential for the persistent neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) that enables working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a diverse class of proteins that modulate excitatory neurotransmission via both presynaptic regulation of extracellular glutamate levels and postsynaptic modulation of ion channels on dendritic spines. This receptor class is of significant therapeutic interest for treatment of cognitive disorders associated with glutamate dysregulation. Working memory impairment and cortical hypoexcitability are both associated with advanced aging. Whether aging modifies PFC mGluR expression, and the extent to which any such alterations are regionally or subtype specific, however, is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether specific mGluRs in PFC are critical for working memory, and thus, whether altered mGluR expression in aging or disease is sufficient to play a causative role in working memory decline. Experiments in the current study first evaluated the effects of age on medial PFC (mPFC) mGluR expression using biochemical and molecular approaches in rats. Of the eight mGluRs examined, only mGluR5, mGluR3, and mGluR4 were significantly reduced in the aged PFC. The reductions in mGluR3 and mGluR5 (but not mGluR4) were observed in both mRNA and protein and were selectively localized to the prelimbic (PrL), but not infralimbic (IL), subregion of mPFC. Finally, pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 or mGluR2/3 using selective antagonists directed to PrL significantly impaired working memory without influencing non-mnemonic aspects of task performance. Together, these data implicate attenuated expression of PFC mGluR5 and mGluR3 in the impaired working memory associated with advanced ages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Psychophysical laws as reflection of mental space properties. (arXiv:1806.11077v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11077</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11077</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The paper is devoted to the relationship between psychophysics and physics of
mind. The basic trends in psychophysics development are briefly discussed with
special attention focused on Teghtsoonian's hypotheses. These hypotheses pose
the concept of the universality of inner psychophysics and enable to speak
about psychological space as an individual object with its own properties.
Turning to the two-component description of human behavior (I. Lubashevsky,
Physics of the Human Mind, Springer, 2017) the notion of mental space is
formulated and human perception of external stimuli is treated as the emergence
of the corresponding images in the mental space. On one hand, these images are
caused by external stimuli and their magnitude bears the information about the
intensity of the corresponding stimuli. On the other hand, the individual
structure of such images as well as their subsistence after emergence is
determined only by the properties of mental space on its own. Finally, the
mental operations of image comparison and their scaling are defined in a way
allowing for the bounded capacity of human cognition. As demonstrated, the
developed theory of stimulus perception is able to explain the basic
regularities of psychophysics, e.g., (i) the regression and range effects
leading to the overestimation of weak stimuli and the underestimation of strong
stimuli, (ii) scalar variability (Weber's and Ekman' laws), and (\textit{iii})
the sequential (memory) effects. As the final result, a solution to the
Fechner-Stevens dilemma is proposed. This solution posits that Fechner's
logarithmic law is not a consequences of Weber's law but stems from the
interplay of uncertainty in evaluating stimulus intensities and the multi-step
scaling required to overcome the stimulus incommensurability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A hierarchical heteroclinic network: Controlling the time evolution along its paths. (arXiv:1806.11039v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11039</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a heteroclinic network in the framework of winnerless competition
of species. It consists of two levels of heteroclinic cycles. On the lower
level, the heteroclinic cycle connects three saddles, each representing the
survival of a single species; on the higher level, the cycle connects three
such heteroclinic cycles, in which nine species are involved. We show how to
tune the predation rates in order to generate the long time scales on the
higher level from the shorter time scales on the lower level. Moreover, when we
tune a single bifurcation parameter, first the motion along the lower and next
along the higher-level heteroclinic cycles are replaced by a heteroclinic cycle
between 3-species coexistence-fixed points and by a 9-species coexistence-fixed
point, respectively. We also observe a similar impact of additive noise. Beyond
its usual role of preventing the slowing-down of heteroclinic trajectories at
small noise level, its increasing strength can replace the lower-level
heteroclinic cycle by 3-species coexistence fixed-points, connected by an
effective limit cycle, and for even stronger noise the trajectories converge to
the 9-species coexistence-fixed point. The model has applications to systems in
which slow oscillations modulate fast oscillations with sudden transitions
between the temporary winners.

	<description>Organisms evolving toward greater complexity were selected across aeons to use energy and resources efficiently. Efficiency depended on prediction at every stage: first a clock to predict the planet’s statistical regularities; then a brain to predict bodily needs and compute commands that dynamically adjust the flows of energy and nutrients. Predictive regulation (allostasis) frugally matches resources to needs and thus forms a core principle of our design. Humans, reaching a pinnacle of cognitive complexity, eventually produced a device (the steam engine) that converted thermal energy to work and were suddenly awash in resources. Today boundless consumption in many nations challenges all our regulatory mechanisms, causing obesity, diabetes, drug addiction and their sequelae. So far we have sought technical solutions, such as drugs, to treat complex circuits for metabolism, appetites and mood. Here I argue for a different approach which starts by asking: why does our regulatory system, which evolution tuned for small satisfactions, now constantly demand 'more'?</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A novel source of arterial valve cells linked to bicuspid aortic valve without raphe in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34110</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34110</link>
	<description>Abnormalities of the arterial valve leaflets, predominantly bicuspid aortic valve, are the commonest congenital malformations. Although many studies have investigated the development of the arterial valves, it has been assumed that, as with the atrioventricular valves, endocardial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is the predominant mechanism. We show that arterial is distinctly different from atrioventricular valve formation. Whilst the four septal valve leaflets are dominated by NCC and EndMT-derived cells, the intercalated leaflets differentiate directly from &lt;i&gt;Tnnt2-Cre&lt;/i&gt;+/Isl1+ progenitors in the outflow wall, via a Notch-Jag dependent mechanism. Further, when this novel group of progenitors are disrupted, development of the intercalated leaflets is disrupted, resulting in leaflet dysplasia and bicuspid valves without raphe, most commonly affecting the aortic valve. This study thus overturns the dogma that heart valves are formed principally by EndMT, identifies a new source of valve interstitial cells, and provides a novel mechanism for causation of bicuspid aortic valves without raphe.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Epidermal LysM receptor ensures robust symbiotic signalling in Lotus japonicus</title>

	<description>Recognition of Nod factors by LysM receptors is crucial for nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in most legumes. The large families of LysM receptors in legumes suggest concerted functions, yet only NFR1 and NFR5 and their closest homologs are known to be required. Here we show that an epidermal LysM receptor (NFRe), ensures robust signalling in &lt;i&gt;L. japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. Mutants of &lt;i&gt;Nfre&lt;/i&gt; react to Nod factors with increased calcium spiking interval, reduced transcriptional response and fewer nodules in the presence of rhizobia. NFRe has an active kinase capable of phosphorylating NFR5, which in turn, controls NFRe downstream signalling. Our findings provide evidence for a more complex Nod factor signalling mechanism than previously anticipated. The spatio-temporal interplay between &lt;i&gt;Nfre&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nfr1&lt;/i&gt;, and their divergent signalling through distinct kinases suggests the presence of an NFRe-mediated idling state keeping the epidermal cells of the expanding root system attuned to rhizobia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A quantitative framework for motion visibility in human cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359562v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Despite the central use of motion visibility to reveal the neural basis of perception, perceptual decision making, and sensory inference there exists no comprehensive quantitative framework establishing how motion visibility parameters modulate human cortical response. Random-dot motion stimuli can be made less visible by reducing image contrast or motion coherence, or by shortening the stimulus duration. Because each of these manipulations modulates the strength of sensory neural responses they have all been extensively used to reveal cognitive and other non-sensory phenomenon such as the influence of priors, attention, and choice-history biases. However, each of these manipulations is thought to influence response in different ways across different cortical regions and a comprehensive study is required to interpret this literature. Here, human participants observed random-dot stimuli varying across a large range of contrast, coherence, and stimulus durations as we measured blood-oxygen-level dependent responses. We developed a framework for modeling these responses which quantifies their functional form and sensitivity across areas. Our framework demonstrates the sensitivity of all visual areas to each parameter, with early visual areas V1-V4 showing more parametric sensitivity to changes in contrast and V3A and MT to coherence. Our results suggest that while motion contrast, coherence, and duration share cortical representation, they are encoded with distinct functional forms and sensitivity. Thus, our quantitative framework serves as a reference for interpretation of the vast perceptual literature manipulating these parameters and shows that different manipulations of visibility will have different effects across human visual cortex and need to be interpreted accordingly.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A large-scale, standardized physiological survey reveals higher order coding throughout the mouse visual cortex</title>

	<description>To understand how the brain processes sensory information to guide behavior, we must know how stimulus representations are transformed throughout the visual cortex. Here we report an open, large-scale physiological survey of neural activity in the awake mouse visual cortex: the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset. This publicly available dataset includes cortical activity from nearly 60,000 neurons collected from 6 visual areas, 4 layers, and 12 transgenic mouse lines from 221 adult mice, in response to a systematic set of visual stimuli. Using this dataset, we reveal functional differences across these dimensions and show that visual cortical responses are sparse but correlated. Surprisingly, responses to different stimuli are largely independent, e.g. whether a neuron responds to natural scenes provides no information about whether it responds to natural movies or to gratings. We show that these phenomena cannot be explained by standard local filter-based models, but are consistent with multi-layer hierarchical computation, as found in deeper layers of standard convolutional neural networks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurobiological Basis of Brain Blood Oxygenation Responses Correlated with Cognitive Stroop Task Performance Before and After an Acute Bout of Aerobic Exercise</title>

	<description>Cardiovascular activities may increase the brain blood flow improving neural activities leading to improved cognition. Consequently, the effects of an acute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise on cortical brain blood oxygenation and its correlation with cognitive color-word Stroop task performance were tested. The Stroop tasks were congruent (color matches word) and incongruent (color does not match word). Prefrontal (PFC) and motor cortex (MC) blood flow was recorded by fNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) while the human subjects performed the Stroop tasks before and after 30 minutes of exercise or equivalent time of rest (controlling for practice effect of repeating the Stroop task multiple times). It was predicted that PFC blood flow increase after exercise will correlate with increased Stroop interference and decreased cognitive flexibility after an acute bout of aerobic exercise at 70% of maximal Heart Rate (HR). We observed that Stroop interference in aerobic exercise and practice alone (rest) were not significantly (p&amp;gt;0.6) different indicating that exercise did not improve cognition above the learning effect. Increase in blood flow (both neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling) in previously deactivated PFC channels was positively correlated (p&amp;lt;0.05) to increased Stroop interference (worse cognitive speed and accuracy) after an acute bout of aerobic exercise.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural tracking of the speech envelope in cochlear implant users</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359299v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: When listening to speech, the brain tracks the speech envelope. It is possible to reconstruct this envelope from EEG recordings. However, in people who hear using a cochlear implant (CI), the artifacts caused by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve contaminate the EEG. This causes the decoder to produce an artifact-dominated reconstruction, which does not reflect the neural signal processing. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for assessing the neural tracking of speech envelope in CI users. Approach: To obtain EEG recordings free of stimulus artifacts, the electrical stimulation is periodically interrupted. During these stimulation gaps, artifact-free EEG can be sampled and used to train a linear envelope decoder. Different recording conditions were used to characterize the artifacts and their influence on the envelope reconstruction. Main results: The present study demonstrates for the first time that neural tracking of the speech envelope can be measured in response to ongoing electrical stimulation. The responses were validated to be truly neural and not affected by stimulus artifact. Significance: Besides applications in audiology and neuroscience, the characterization and elimination of stimulus artifacts will enable future EEG studies involving continuous speech in CI users. Measures of neural tracking of the speech envelope reflect interesting properties of the listener's perception of speech, such as speech intelligibility or attentional state. Successful decoding of neural envelope tracking will open new possibilities to investigate the neural mechanisms of speech perception with a CI.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual signals suppress Alpha Power Increases &amp; Frequency Decreases before and after a Mindfulness Meditation Intervention for Problem Gambling</title>

	<description>The use of mindfulness meditation (MM) in the treatment of problem gambling (PG), has been used effectively for over five years. However, the neural mechanisms responsible for the improvements are unknown. The literature describes healthy individuals with an increase in alpha power and a decrease in alpha frequency after eight weeks of mindfulness meditation, but it is unknown if changes are similar amongst individuals with PG. Using resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG), we measured the changes in alpha oscillations before and after an eight-week mindfulness meditation intervention (MMi) and a pre/post-five-minute mindfulness meditation body scan (MMb). For people with PG, we observed an increase in alpha power and decreased alpha peak frequency after the MMi, while the inverse was true for the MMb. The most considerable alpha rhythm changes occurred in the frontal and temporal lobes, areas sensitive to reward and sensory processing in PG. Our observed changes may reflect theories that MMi for PG may improve attentional control as hypothesized by previous research in alpha oscillations and cue-reward processing.</description>

	<description>Saccades are ballistic eye movements that rapidly shift gaze from one location of visual space to another. Detecting saccades in eye movement recordings is important not only for studying the neural mechanisms underlying sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, but also as a clinical and diagnostic tool. However, automatically detecting saccades can be difficult, particularly when such saccades are generated in coordination with other tracking eye movements, like smooth pursuits, or when the saccade amplitude is close to eye tracker noise levels, like with microsaccades. In such cases, labeling by human experts is required, but this is a tedious task prone to variability and error. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect saccades at human-level performance accuracy. Our algorithm surpasses state of the art according to common performance metrics, and will facilitate studies of neurophysiological processes underlying saccade generation and visual processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: MRI-related anxiety in healthy individuals, intrinsic BOLD oscillations at 0.1 Hz and heart rate variability in low frequency bands</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/359000v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Participation in a MRI scan is associated with increased anxiety, thus possibly impacting baseline recording for functional MRI studies. We investigated in 23 healthy individuals without any former MRI experience (scanner-naive) the relations between anxiety, 0.1-Hz BOLD oscillations and heart rate variability (HRV) in two separate resting state sessions (R1, R2). BOLD signals were recorded from precentral gyrus (PCG) and insula in both hemispheres. Phase-locking and time delays were computed in the frequency band 0.07-0.13 Hz. Positive (pTD) and negative time delays (nTD) were found. The pTD characterize descending neural BOLD oscillations spreading from PCG to insula and nTD characterize ascending vascular BOLD oscillations related to blood flow in the middle cerebral artery. HRV power in two low frequency bands 0.06-0.1 Hz and 0.1-0.14 Hz was computed. Based on the drop rate of the anxiety level from R1 to R2, two groups could be identified: one with a strong anxiety decline (large drop group) and one with a moderate decline or even anxiety increase (small drop group). A significant correlation was found only between the left-hemispheric time delay (pTD, nTD) of BOLD oscillations and anxiety drop, with a dominance of nTD in the large drop group. The analysis of within-scanner HRV revealed a pronounced increase of low frequency power between both resting states, dominant in the band 0.06-0.1 Hz in the large drop group and in the band 0.1-0.14 Hz in the small drop group. These results suggest different mechanisms related to anxiety processing in healthy individuals. One mechanism (large drop group) could embrace an increase of blood circulation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (vascular BOLD) and another (small drop group) translates to rhythmic central commands (neural BOLD) in the frequency band 0.1-0.14 Hz.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/358903v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Understanding seizure formation and spread remains a critical goal of epilepsy research. While many studies have documented seizure spread, it remains mysterious how they start. We used fast in-vivo two-photon calcium imaging to reconstruct, at cellular resolution, the dynamics of focal cortical seizures as they emerge in epileptic foci (intrafocal), and subsequently propagate (extrafocal). We find that seizures start as intrafocal coactivation of small numbers of neurons (ensembles), which are electrographically silent. These silent microseizures expand saltatorily until they break into neighboring cortex, where they progress smoothly and first become detectable by LFP. Surprisingly, we find spatially heterogeneous calcium dynamics of local PV interneuron sub-populations, which rules out a simple role of inhibitory neurons during seizures. We propose a two-step model for the circuit mechanisms of focal seizures, where neuronal ensembles first generate a silent microseizure, followed by widespread neural activation in a travelling wave, which is then detected electrophysiologically.</description>

	<description>Healthy aging is associated with declines in episodic memory performance that are due in part to deficits in encoding. Emerging results from young adult studies suggest that the neural activity during the time-period preceding stimulus presentation is sensitive to episodic memory performance. It is unknown whether age-related declines in episodic memory are due solely to changes in the recruitment of processes elicited by stimuli during encoding or also in processes recruited in anticipation of these stimuli. Here, we recorded oscillatory EEG while young and old participants encoded visual and auditory words that were preceded by cues indicating the stimulus modality. Alpha oscillatory activity preceding and following stimulus onset was predictive of subsequent memory accuracy similarly across age. Frontal beta oscillations linked to semantic elaboration during encoding were reduced by age. Post-stimulus theta power was positively predictive of episodic memory accuracy for old but not young adults, potentially reflecting older adults' tendency to self-generate associations during encoding. Collectively, these results suggest that the preparatory mobilization of neural processes prior to encoding that benefits episodic memory performance is not affected by age.</description>

	<description>The human visual system supports stable percepts of object color even though the light that reflects from object surfaces varies significantly with the scene illumination. To understand the computations that support stable color perception, we study how estimating a target object light reflectance value (LRV; a measure of the light reflected from the object under a standard illuminant) depends on variation in key properties of naturalistic scenes. Specifically, we study how variation in target object reflectance, illumination spectra, and the reflectance of background objects in a scene impact estimation of a target object LRV. To do this, we applied supervised statistical learning methods to the simulated excitations of human cone photoreceptors, obtained from labeled naturalistic images. The naturalistic images were rendered with computer graphics, with the underlying scene descriptions generated stochastically using statistical models of natural spectral variation. Optimally decoding target object LRV from the responses of a small learned set of task-specific linear receptive fields that operate on a contrast representation of the cone excitations yields estimates that are within 13% of the correct LRV. Our work provides a framework for evaluating how different sources of scene variability limit performance on luminance constancy.</description>

	<description>Structural and transcriptional changes during early brain maturation follow fixed developmental programs defined by genetics. However, whether this is true for functional network activity remains unknown, primarily due to experimental inaccessibility of the initial stages of the living human brain. Here, we analyzed cortical organoids that spontaneously developed periodic and regular oscillatory network events that are dependent on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. These nested oscillations exhibit cross-frequency coupling, proposed to coordinate neuronal computation and communication. As evidence of potential network maturation, oscillatory activity subsequently transitioned to more spatiotemporally irregular patterns, capturing features observed in preterm human electroencephalography (EEG). These results show that the development of structured network activity in the human neocortex may follow stable genetic programming, even in the absence of external or subcortical inputs. Our model provides novel opportunities for investigating and manipulating the role of network activity in the developing human cortex.</description>

	<description>Temporal lobe epilepsy causes significant cognitive deficits in both human patients and rodent models, yet the specific circuit mechanisms that alter cognitive processes remain unknown. There is dramatic and selective interneuron death and axonal reorganization within the hippocampus of both humans and animal models, but the functional consequences of these changes on information processing at the neuronal population level have not been well characterized. To examine spatial representations of epileptic and control mice, we developed a novel wire-free miniature microscope to allow for unconstrained behavior during in vivo calcium imaging of neuronal activity. We found that epileptic mice running on a linear track had severely impaired spatial processing in CA1 within a single session, as place cells were less precise and less stable, and population coding was impaired. Long-term stability of place cells was also compromised as place cells in epileptic mice were highly unstable across short time intervals and completely remapped across a week. Because of the large-scale reorganization of inhibitory circuits in epilepsy, we hypothesized that degraded spatial representations were caused by dysfunctional inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we examined the temporal dynamics of hippocampal interneurons using silicon probes to simultaneously record from CA1 and dentate gyrus during head-fixed virtual navigation. We found that epileptic mice had a profound reduction in theta coherence between the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions and altered interneuron synchronization. In particular, dentate interneurons of epileptic mice had altered phase preferences to ongoing theta oscillations, which decorrelated inhibitory population firing between CA1 and dentate gyrus. To assess the specific contribution of desynchronization on spatial coding, we built a CA1 network model to simulate hippocampal desynchronization. Critically, we found that desynchronized inputs reduced the information content and stability of CA1 neurons, consistent with the experimental data. Together, these results demonstrate that temporally precise intra-hippocampal communication is critical for forming the spatial code and that desynchronized firing of hippocampal neuronal populations contributes to poor spatial processing in epileptic mice.</description>

	<description>Cortico-spinal excitability (CSE) in humans measured with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is generally increased by the perception of other people's actions. This perception can be unimodal (visual or auditory) or multimodal (visual and auditory). The increase in TMS-measured CSE is typically prominent for muscles involved in the perceived action (muscle specificity). There are two main classes of accounts for this phenomenon. One suggests that the motor system mirrors the actions that the observer perceives (the resonance account). The other suggests that the motor system predicts the actions that the observer perceives (the predictive account). To test these accounts (which need not be mutually exclusive), subjects were presented with four versions of three-note piano sequences: sound only, sight only, audiovisual, and audiovisual with sound lagging behind while CSE was measured in two hand muscles. Muscle specificity did not interact with modality in the flexor digiti minimi (FDM), but was reliably higher for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) while subjects perceived the audiovisual version of the three-note piano sequences with sound lagging behind. Since this version of the three-note piano sequences is the only one that overtly violates experience-based expectations, this finding supports predictive coding accounts of motor facilitation during action perception.</description>

	<description>How does high-level visual cortex process temporal aspects of our visual experience? By modeling neural responses with millisecond precision in separate sustained and transient channels, we predict fMRI responses for stimuli ranging from 33 ms to 20 s. Using this approach, we discovered that lateral temporal regions process visual transients associated with stimulus onsets and offsets but not sustained visual information. That is, they compute moment-to-moment visual transitions. In contrast, ventral temporal regions process both sustained and transient components, with the former exhibiting adaptation and the latter showing larger contributions from stimulus offsets than onsets. Transient responses in ventral regions may reflect rapid processing of new items at stimulus onset and a memory trace when they are no longer visible at stimulus offset. Together, these findings reveal a fundamental temporal mechanism that distinguishes visual streams and underscore the promise of modeling brain responses with millisecond precision to understand neural computations.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Munro, Dario Ghersi, Mona Singh&lt;/p&gt;

A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma—two specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei87dOiwXCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Foreground-Background Segmentation Revealed during Natural Image Viewing</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity, measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we produced easily interpretable &quot;correlation images&quot; from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions, from V1 to LOC, while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. &quot;Correlation images&quot; derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Foreground-background segmentation has been considered critical to form discrete object representations from continuous sensory percepts. We developed a pre-filtering approach which overcame typical limitations in modeling brain responses to complex stimuli and could be generalized to related processes. Our findings provide novel support to the hypothesis that foreground-background segmentation of natural scenes occurs during passive perception, sustained by the distributed activity of multiple areas across the visual processing stream. Specifically, while foreground information is enhanced along the entire visual pathway, V4 and LOC show a background suppression effect, though retaining texture information from the foreground. Our observations challenge the idea that these regions of the visual system may primarily encode simple object representations based on silhouette or shape features only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Early Abrogation of Gelatinase Activity Extends the Time Window for tPA Thrombolysis after Embolic Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is caused by clotting in the cerebral arteries, leading to brain oxygen deprivation and cerebral infarction. Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for ischemic stroke. However, tPA has to be administered within 4.5 h from the disease onset and delayed treatment of tPA can increase the risk of neurovascular impairment, including neuronal cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hemorrhagic transformation. A key contributing factor for tPA-induced neurovascular impairment is activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). We used a clinically-relevant mouse embolic model of focal-cerebral ischemia by insertion of a single embolus of blood clot to block the right middle cerebral artery. We showed that administration of the potent and highly selective gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT extends the time window for administration of tPA, attenuating infarct volume, mitigating BBB disruption, and antagonizing the increase in cerebral hemorrhage induced by tPA treatment. We demonstrated that SB-3CT attenuates tPA-induced expression of vascular MMP-9, prevents gelatinase-mediated cleavage of extracellular laminin, rescues endothelial cells, and reduces caveolae-mediated transcytosis of endothelial cells. These results suggest that abrogation of MMP-9 activity mitigates the detrimental effects of tPA treatment, thus the combination treatment holds great promise for extending the therapeutic window for tPA thrombolysis, which opens the opportunity for clinical recourse to a greater number of patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Simultaneous Ablation of Neuronal Neurofascin and Ankyrin G in Young and Adult Mice Reveals Age-Dependent Increase in Nodal Stability in Myelinated Axons and Differential Effects on the Lifespan</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nodes of Ranvier are unique regions where voltage-gated sodium channels are highly enriched to drive saltatory conduction. Genetic ablations in adult mice with loss of specific nodal proteins causes slow but progressive nodal deterioration associated with decreased nerve conduction and axonopathy. What has remained unaddressed is whether loss of nodal proteins at different time points in postnatal life follows similar timelines of nodal disorganization. Here we utilized simultaneous ablation of Neurofascin (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG) in mice of both sexes at three specific time points. We report that concurrent ablation of these core nodal components at postnatal day 13 (P13) leads to accelerated nodal destabilization in comparison with P23, and this disorganization is even slower when ablated at P93. Ablation of NF186 with AnkG at P13 reduced the half-life of NF186 to 15 days compared to 1 month at P23, which increased to 2 months at P93, indicating increasing nodal stability. The half-life of AnkG at the nodes also increased with age but showed enhanced disappearance from the node in the absence of NF186, with a half-life of 3 days at P13 ablation. The nodal disorganization occurred in a sequential manner, with AnkG disappearing first from the nodal areas irrespective of the timing of ablation, and led to decreased nerve conduction and affected axonal health. Together, our studies reveal that nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons continue to become more stable with age and suggest that nodal disorganization in adult human demyelinating disorders occurs slowly until neurological symptoms become evident.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The time-changing nature of our world demands processing of huge amounts of
information in fast and reliable way to generate successful behaviors.
Therefore, significant brain resources are devoted to process spatiotemporal
information. Neural basis of spatial processing and their cognitive correlates
are well established mostly for static environments. Nonetheless, in
time-changing situations the brain exploits specific processing mechanisms for
temporal information based on prediction and anticipation, as time compression
during visual perception and mental navigation. Alternative hypothesis of time
compaction integrates both views, postulating that dynamic situations are
internally represented as static spatial maps where temporal information is
extracted by predicting and structuring the relevant interactions.
Nevertheless, empirical approaches tackling the biological soundness of time
compaction are still lacking. Here we show that performance in a discrimination
learning task involving dynamic situations can be either favored or hampered
via previous exposition to interfering static scenes. In this sense, men were
effectively conditioned in contrast to a control group, in coherence with the
hypothesis. Meanwhile, women performed on par with control men, regardless of
the previous conditioning. This suggests time compaction is a salient cognitive
strategy in men when dealing with dynamic situations, while women seem to rely
on a broader range of information processing strategies. Finally, we further
corroborated the time compaction mechanism involved in these experimental
findings through a mathematical model of the experimental process. Our results
point to some form of static internal representation mechanism at cognitive
level involved in decision-making and strategy planning in dynamic situations

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A neuro-inspired system for online learning and recognition of parallel spike trains, based on spike latency and heterosynaptic STDP. (arXiv:1806.10409v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans perform remarkably well in many cognitive tasks including pattern
recognition. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not
well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain
circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern
recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multineuronal spike pattern
detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and
recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to
different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure
is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike
latency, that enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and
heterosynaptic plasticity, that allows the own regulation of synaptic weights.
From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows
mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multidimensional, temporal, feature
space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron
fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be
considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to
experimental data obtained from a motor inhibitory cognitive task. The test
exhibits good classification performance, indicating the adequateness of our
approach. In addition to its effectiveness, its simplicity and low
computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time
recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface,
personal biometrics authentication or early detection of diseases.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Clustering coefficients for correlation networks. (arXiv:1806.10228v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10228</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The clustering coefficient quantifies the abundance of connected triangles in
a network and is a major descriptive statistics of networks. For example, it
finds an application in the assessment of small-worldness of brain networks,
which is affected by attentional and cognitive conditions, age, psychiatric
disorders and so forth. However, it remains unclear how the clustering
coefficient should be measured in a correlation-based network, which is among
major representations of brain networks. In the present article, we propose
clustering coefficients tailored to correlation matrices. The key idea is to
use three-way partial correlation or partial mutual information to measure the
strength of the association between the two neighbouring nodes of a focal node
relative to the amount of pseudo-correlation expected from indirect paths
between the nodes. Our method avoids the difficulties of previous applications
of clustering coefficient (and other) measures in defining correlational
networks, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value, discarding of negative
correlation values, the pseudo-correlation problem and full partial correlation
matrices whose estimation is computationally difficult. For proof of concept,
we apply the proposed clustering coefficient measures to functional magnetic
resonance imaging data obtained from healthy participants of various ages and
compare them with conventional clustering coefficients. We show that the
clustering coefficients decline with the age. The proposed clustering
coefficients are more strongly correlated with age than the conventional ones
are. We also show that the local variants of the proposed clustering
coefficients are useful in characterising individual nodes. In contrast, the
conventional local clustering coefficients were strongly correlated with and
therefore may be confounded by the node's connectivity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that the backpropagation algorithm is essential for
learning good feature detectors in early layers of artificial neural networks,
so that these detectors are useful for the task performed by the higher layers
of that neural network. At the same time, the traditional form of
backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an
unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility, and which
is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local
- i.e. should depend only on the activities of the pre and post synaptic
neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the
hidden layer, and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a
completely unsupervised way. These learned lower layer feature detectors can be
used to train higher layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the
performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard
feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic inference provides a language for describing how organisms may
learn from and adapt to their environment. The computations needed to implement
probabilistic inference often require specific representations, akin to having
the suitable data structures for implementing certain algorithms in computer
programming. Yet it is unclear how such representations can be instantiated in
the stochastic, parallel-running biochemical machinery found in cells (such as
single-celled organisms). Here, we show how representations for supporting
inference in Markov models can be embodied in cellular circuits, by combining a
concentration-dependent scheme for encoding probabilities with a mechanism for
directional counting. We show how the logic of protein production and
degradation constrains the computation we set out to implement. We argue that
this process by which an abstract computation is shaped by its biochemical
realization strikes a compromise between &quot;rationalistic&quot; information-processing
perspectives and alternative approaches that emphasize embodiment.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35028</link>
	<description>A major challenge in neuroscience is to longitudinally monitor whole brain activity across multiple spatial scales in the same animal. Functional UltraSound (fUS) is an emerging technology that offers images of cerebral blood volume over large brain portions. Here we show for the first time its capability to resolve the functional organization of sensory systems at multiple scales in awake animals, both &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; small structures by precisely mapping and differentiating sensory responses, and &lt;i&gt;between&lt;/i&gt; structures by elucidating the connectivity scheme of top-down projections. We demonstrate that fUS provides stable (over days), yet rapid, highly-resolved 3D tonotopic maps in the auditory pathway of awake ferrets, thus revealing its unprecedented functional resolution (100/300µm). This was performed in four different brain regions, including very small (1-2mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; size), deeply situated subcortical (8mm deep) and previously undescribed structures in the ferret. Furthermore, we used fUS to map long-distance projections from frontal cortex, a key source of sensory response modulation, to auditory cortex.</description>

	<description>Pitx2c, a homeodomain transcription factor, is classically known for its left-right patterning role. However, an early wave of &lt;i&gt;pitx2&lt;/i&gt; expression occurs at the onset of gastrulation in several species, indicating a possible earlier role that remains relatively unexplored. Here we show that in zebrafish, maternal-zygotic (MZ) &lt;i&gt;pitx2c&lt;/i&gt; mutants exhibit a shortened body axis indicative of convergence and extension (CE) defects. Live imaging reveals that MZ&lt;i&gt;pitx2c&lt;/i&gt; mutants display less persistent mesendodermal migration during late stages of gastrulation. Transplant data indicate that Pitx2c functions cell non-autonomously to regulate this cell behavior by modulating cell shape and protrusive activity. Using transcriptomic analyses and candidate gene approaches, we identify transcriptional changes in components of the chemokine-ECM-integrin dependent mesendodermal migration network. Together, our results define pathways downstream of Pitx2c that are required during early embryogenesis and reveal novel functions for Pitx2c as a regulator of morphogenesis.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Autonomic Network: Synchrony Between Slow Rhythms of Pulse and Brain Resting State Is Associated with Personality and Emotions</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The sympathetic system’s role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase–amplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &amp;lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt;) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; mapping revealed an “autonomic brain network,” including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing – the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions – to have real causal power in decision-making.</description>

Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6XKqTbGe3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: h-Type Membrane Current Shapes the Local Field Potential from Populations of Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/6011?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In cortex, the local field potential (LFP) is thought to mainly stem from correlated synaptic input to populations of geometrically aligned neurons. Computer models of single cortical pyramidal neurons showed that subthreshold voltage-dependent membrane conductances can also shape the LFP signal, in particular the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;; h-type). This ion channel is prominent in various types of pyramidal neurons, typically showing an increasing density gradient along the apical dendrites. Here, we investigate how &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; affects the LFP generated by a model of a population of cortical pyramidal neurons. We find that the LFP from populations of neurons that receive uncorrelated synaptic input can be well predicted by the LFP from single neurons. In this case, when input impinges on the distal dendrites, where most h-type channels are located, a strong resonance in the LFP was measured near the soma, whereas the opposite configuration does not reveal an &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; contribution to the LFP. Introducing correlations in the synaptic inputs to the pyramidal cells strongly amplifies the LFP, while maintaining the differential effects of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; for distal dendritic versus perisomatic input. Previous theoretical work showed that input correlations do not amplify LFP power when neurons receive synaptic input uniformly across the cell. We find that this crucially depends on the membrane conductance distribution: the asymmetric distribution of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; results in a strong amplification of the LFP when synaptic inputs to the cell population are correlated. In conclusion, we find that the h-type current is particularly suited to shape the LFP signal in cortical populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular potentials recorded in neural tissue, is often used for probing neural circuit activity. While the cortical LFP is thought to mainly reflect synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons, little is known about the role of subthreshold active conductances in shaping the LFP. By means of biophysical modeling we obtain a comprehensive, qualitative understanding of how LFPs generated by populations of cortical pyramidal neurons depend on active subthreshold currents, and identify the key importance of the h-type channel. Our results show that LFPs can give information about the active properties of neurons and that preferred frequencies in the LFP can result from those cellular properties instead of, for example, network dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Laminin {beta}2 Chain Regulates Retinal Progenitor Cell Mitotic Spindle Orientation via Dystroglycan</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5996?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate retinal development follows a pattern during which retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) give rise to all retinal cell types in a highly conserved temporal sequence. RPC proliferation and cell cycle exit are tightly coordinated to ensure proper and timely production of each of the retinal cell types. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in eye development, influencing RPC proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that laminins, key ECM components, in the inner limiting membrane, control mitotic spindle orientation by providing environmental cues to the RPCs. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; deletion of laminin β2 in mice of both sexes results in a loss RPC basal processes and contact with the ECM, leading to a shift of the mitotic spindle pole orientation toward asymmetric cell divisions. This leads to decreased proliferation and premature RPC pool depletion, resulting in overproduction of rod photoreceptors at the expense of bipolar cells and Müller glia. Moreover, we show that deletion of laminin β2 leads to disruption and mislocalization of its receptors: dystroglycan and β1-integrin. Addition of exogenous β2-containing laminins to laminin β2-deficient retinal explants stabilizes the RPC basal processes and directs their mitotic spindle orientation toward symmetric divisions, leading to increased RPC proliferation, as well as restores proper receptor localization at the retinal surface. Finally, functional blocking of dystroglycan in wild-type retinal explants phenocopies laminin β2 ablation. Our data suggest that dystroglycan-mediated signaling between RPCs and the ECM is of key importance in controlling critical developmental events during retinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms governing retinogenesis are subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling cues. Although the role of intrinsic signaling has been the subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of the microenvironment in retinal development remains unclear. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; approaches, we demonstrate that laminins, key extracellular matrix components, provide signaling cues that control retinal progenitor cell attachment to the basement membrane, mitotic axis, proliferation, and fate adoption. Moreover, we identify, for the first time, dystroglycan as the receptor responsible for directing retinal progenitor cell mitotic spindle orientation. Our data suggest a mechanism where dystroglycan-mediated signaling between the cell and the extracellular matrix controls the proliferative potential of progenitors in the developing CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We developed an innovative biomaterial-based approach to repair the critical neural circuitry that controls diaphragm activation by locally delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to injured cervical spinal cord. BDNF can be used to restore respiratory function via a number of potential repair mechanisms; however, widespread BDNF biodistribution resulting from delivery methods such as systemic injection or lumbar puncture can lead to inefficient drug delivery and adverse side effects. As a viable alternative, we developed a novel hydrogel-based system loaded with polysaccharide-BDNF particles self-assembled by electrostatic interactions that can be safely implanted in the intrathecal space for achieving local BDNF delivery with controlled dosing and duration. Implantation of BDNF hydrogel after C4/C5 contusion-type spinal cord injury (SCI) in female rats robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of compound muscle action potential and electromyography amplitudes. However, BDNF hydrogel did not decrease lesion size or degeneration of cervical motor neuron soma, suggesting that its therapeutic mechanism of action was not neuroprotection within spinal cord. Interestingly, BDNF hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by detailed neuromuscular junction morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from diaphragm using cholera toxin B. Furthermore, BDNF hydrogel enhanced the serotonergic axon innervation of PhMNs that plays an important role in modulating PhMN excitability. Our findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a robustly effective and safe strategy to restore diaphragm function after SCI. In addition, we demonstrate novel therapeutic mechanisms by which BDNF can repair respiratory neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Respiratory compromise is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We used an innovative biomaterial-based drug delivery system in the form of a hydrogel that can be safely injected into the intrathecal space for achieving local delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with controlled dosing and duration, while avoiding side effects associated with other delivery methods. In a clinically relevant rat model of cervical contusion-type SCI, BDNF hydrogel robustly and persistently improved diaphragmatic respiratory function by enhancing phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) innervation of the diaphragm neuromuscular junction and by increasing serotonergic innervation of PhMNs in ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. These exciting findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a safe and robustly effective strategy to maintain respiratory function after cervical SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modality-Independent Coding of Scene Categories in Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5969?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Natural environments convey information through multiple sensory modalities, all of which contribute to people's percepts. Although it has been shown that visual or auditory content of scene categories can be decoded from brain activity, it remains unclear how humans represent scene information beyond a specific sensory modality domain. To address this question, we investigated how categories of scene images and sounds are represented in several brain regions. A group of healthy human subjects (both sexes) participated in the present study, where their brain activity was measured with fMRI while viewing images or listening to sounds of different real-world environments. We found that both visual and auditory scene categories can be decoded not only from modality-specific areas, but also from several brain regions in the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Intriguingly, only in the PFC, but not in any other regions, categories of scene images and sounds appear to be represented in similar activation patterns, suggesting that scene representations in PFC are modality-independent. Furthermore, the error patterns of neural decoders indicate that category-specific neural activity patterns in the middle and superior frontal gyri are tightly linked to categorization behavior. Our findings demonstrate that complex scene information is represented at an abstract level in the PFC, regardless of the sensory modality of the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our experience in daily life includes multiple sensory inputs, such as images, sounds, or scents from the surroundings, which all contribute to our understanding of the environment. Here, for the first time, we investigated where and how in the brain information about the natural environment from multiple senses is merged to form modality-independent representations of scene categories. We show direct decoding of scene categories across sensory modalities from patterns of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We also conclusively tie these neural representations to human categorization behavior by comparing patterns of errors between a neural decoder and behavior. Our findings suggest that PFC is a central hub for integrating sensory information and computing modality-independent representations of scene categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Microglial Activity, Impaired Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis, and Depressive-like Behavior in Microglial VPS35-Depleted Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5949?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vacuolar sorting protein 35 (VPS35) is a critical component of retromer, which is essential for selective endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of membrane proteins. VPS35 deficiency is implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, exactly how VPS35 loss promotes AD pathogenesis remains largely unclear. VPS35 is expressed in various types of cells in the brain, including neurons and microglia. Whereas neuronal VPS35 plays a critical role in preventing neurodegeneration, the role of microglial VPS35 is largely unknown. Here we provide evidence for microglial VPS35's function in preventing microglial activation and promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis. VPS35 is expressed in microglia in various regions of the mouse brain, with a unique distribution pattern in a brain region-dependent manner. Conditional knocking out of VPS35 in microglia of male mice results in regionally increased microglial density and activity in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), accompanied by elevated neural progenitor proliferation, but decreased neuronal differentiation. Additionally, newborn neurons in the mutant DG show impaired dendritic morphology and reduced dendritic spine density. When examining the behavioral phenotypes of these animals, microglial VPS3S-depleted mice display depression-like behavior and impairment in long-term recognition memory. At the cellular level, VPS35-depleted microglia have grossly enlarged vacuolar structures with increased phagocytic activity toward postsynaptic marker PSD95, which may underlie the loss of dendritic spines observed in the mutant DG. Together, these findings identify an important role of microglial VPS35 in suppressing microglial activation and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis, which are both processes involved in AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The findings presented here provide the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence that Vacuolar sorting protein 35 (VPS35)/retromer is essential for regulating microglial function and that when microglial retromer mechanics are disrupted, the surrounding brain tissue can be affected in a neurodegenerative manner. These findings present a novel, microglial-specific role of VPS35 and raise multiple questions regarding the mechanisms underlying our observations. These findings also have myriad implications for the field of retromer research and the role of retromer dysfunction in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Furthermore, they implicate a pivotal role of microglia in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the survival/integration of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chemogenetic Activation of Prefrontal Cortex Rescues Synaptic and Behavioral Deficits in a Mouse Model of 16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5939?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microdeletion of the human 16p11.2 gene locus has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and confers risk for a number of other neurodevelopmental deficits. Transgenic mice carrying 16p11.2 deletion (&lt;i&gt;16p11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;) display phenotypes reminiscent of those in human patients with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms and treatment strategies for these phenotypes remain unknown. In this study, we have found that both male and female &lt;i&gt;16p11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit deficient NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region critical for high-level &quot;executive&quot; functions. Elevating the activity of mPFC pyramidal neurons with a CaMKII-driven Gq-DREADD (Gq-coupled designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) led to the significant increase of NR2B subunit phosphorylation and the restoration of NMDAR function, as well as the amelioration of cognitive and social impairments in &lt;i&gt;16p11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These results suggest that NMDAR hypofunction in PFC may contribute to the pathophysiology of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome and that restoring PFC activity is sufficient to rescue the behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Using a mouse model carrying the 16p11.2 deletion, &lt;i&gt;16p11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;, we identified NMDA receptor hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Elevating the activity of PFC pyramidal neurons with a chemogenetic tool, Gq-DREADD, led to the restoration of NMDA receptor function and the amelioration of cognitive and social impairments in &lt;i&gt;16p11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These results have revealed a novel route for potential therapeutic intervention of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pre-Bout Neural Activity Changes in Premotor Nucleus HVC Correlate with Successful Initiation of Learned Song Sequence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5925?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5925?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preparatory activity, characterized by gradual, longer timescale changes in neural activity, is present in a number of different brain areas before the onset of simple movements and is believed to be important for movement initiation. However, relatively little is known about such activity before initiation of naturally learned movement sequences. The song of an adult male zebra finch is a well studied example of a naturally learned movement sequence and previous studies have shown robust premotor activity immediately before song. Here, I characterize longer timescale changes in neural activity in adult male zebra finch premotor nucleus HVC before onset of song bouts. I show that interneurons and a subset of basal-ganglia-projecting neurons change their activity several hundred milliseconds before song bout onset. Interneurons increased their activity, whereas basal-ganglia-projecting neurons either increased or decreased their activity. Such changes in neural activity were larger, started earlier, and were more common specifically before song bouts that began with the short, repetitive, introductory notes (INs) characteristic of zebra finch song bouts. Further, stronger and earlier changes were also correlated with successful song sequence initiation. Finally, a small fraction of basal-ganglia-projecting neurons that increased their activity before song bout onset did not have song or IN-related activity, suggesting a specialized preparatory role for such neurons. Overall, these data suggest that pre-bout activity in HVC represents preparatory activity important for initiation of a naturally learned movement sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Changes in neuronal activity well before the onset of simple movements are thought to be important for movement initiation. However, a number of animal movements consist of sequences of simple movements and relatively little is known about neuronal activity before such movement sequences. Using adult zebra finch song, a well studied example of a movement sequence, I show here that neurons in premotor nucleus HVC change their activity hundreds of milliseconds before song bout onset. In most neurons, the presence of such changes correlated with successful song sequence initiation. My results show the presence of preparatory neural activity in HVC and suggest a role for HVC in sequence initiation in addition to its established role in song sequence timing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cell-Type-Specific Role of {Delta}FosB in Nucleus Accumbens In Modulating Intermale Aggression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of studies implicate the brain's reward circuitry in aggressive behavior. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms within brain reward regions that modulate the intensity of aggression as well as motivation for it have been underexplored. Here, we investigate the cell-type-specific influence of FosB, a transcription factor known to regulate a range of reward and motivated behaviors, acting in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward region, in male aggression in mice. We show that FosB is specifically increased in dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1)-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in NAc after repeated aggressive encounters. Viral-mediated induction of FosB selectively in D1-MSNs of NAc intensifies aggressive behavior without affecting the preference for the aggression-paired context in a conditioned place preference (CPP) assay. In contrast, FosB induction selectively in D2-MSNs reduces the time spent exploring the aggression-paired context during CPP without affecting the intensity of aggression per se. These data strongly support a dissociable cell-type-specific role for FosB in the NAc in modulating aggression and aggression reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aggressive behavior is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders and can be disruptive for affected individuals as well as their victims. Studies have shown a positive reinforcement mechanism underlying aggressive behavior that shares many common features with drug addiction. Here, we explore the cell-type-specific role of the addiction-associated transcription factor FosB in the nucleus accumbens in aggression. We found that FosB expression promotes aggressive behavior, effects that are dissociable from its effects on aggression reward. This finding is a significant first step in identifying therapeutic targets for the reduction of aggressive behavior across a range of neuropsychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Blocking Autophagy in Oligodendrocytes Limits Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5900?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5900?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy mechanisms are well documented in neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI), but the direct functional role of autophagy in oligodendrocyte (OL) survival in SCI pathogenesis remains unknown. Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved lysosomal-mediated catabolic pathway that ensures degradation of dysfunctional cellular components to maintain homeostasis in response to various forms of stress, including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Using pharmacological gain and loss of function and genetic approaches, we investigated the contribution of autophagy in OL survival and its role in the pathogenesis of thoracic contusive SCI in female mice. Although upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Atg5&lt;/i&gt; (an essential autophagy gene) occurs after SCI, autophagy flux is impaired. Purified myelin fractions of contused 8 d post-SCI samples show enriched protein levels of LC3B, ATG5, and BECLIN 1. Data show that, while the nonspecific drugs rapamycin (activates autophagy) and spautin 1 (blocks autophagy) were pharmacologically active on autophagy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, their administration did not alter locomotor recovery after SCI. To directly analyze the role of autophagy, transgenic mice with conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Atg5&lt;/i&gt; in OLs were generated. Analysis of hindlimb locomotion demonstrated a significant reduction in locomotor recovery after SCI that correlated with a greater loss in spared white matter. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that deletion of &lt;i&gt;Atg5&lt;/i&gt; from OLs resulted in decreased autophagic flux and was detrimental to OL function after SCI. Thus, our study provides evidence that autophagy is an essential cytoprotective pathway operating in OLs and is required for hindlimb locomotor recovery after thoracic SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study describes the role of autophagy in oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and pathogenesis after thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). Modulation of autophagy with available nonselective drugs after thoracic SCI does not affect locomotor recovery despite being pharmacologically active &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, indicating significant off-target effects. Using transgenic mice with conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Atg5&lt;/i&gt; in OLs, this study definitively identifies autophagy as an essential homeostatic pathway that operates in OLs and exhibits a direct functional role in SCI pathogenesis and recovery. Therefore, this study emphasizes the need to discover novel autophagy-specific drugs that specifically modulate autophagy for further investigation for clinical translation to treat SCI and other CNS pathologies related to OL survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Copine-6 Binds to SNAREs and Selectively Suppresses Spontaneous Neurotransmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5888?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5888?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that spontaneous and action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release processes are independently regulated. However, the mechanisms that uncouple the two forms of neurotransmission remain unclear. In cultured mouse and rat neurons, we show that the two C2 domain-containing protein copine-6 is localized to presynaptic terminals and binds to synaptobrevin2 as well as other SNARE proteins in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent interaction of copine-6 with synaptobrevin2 selectively suppresses spontaneous neurotransmission in a reaction that requires the tandem tryptophan residues at the C-terminal region of synaptobrevin2. Accordingly, copine-6 loss of function augmented presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation-mediated neurotransmitter release. Intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelation, on the other hand, occluded copine-6-mediated suppression of release. We also evaluated the molecular specificity of the copine-6-dependent regulation of spontaneous release and found that overexpression of copine-6 did not suppress spontaneous release in synaptobrevin2-deficient neurons. Together, these results suggest that copine-6 acts as a specific Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent suppressor of spontaneous neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic transmission occurs both in response to presynaptic action potentials and spontaneously, in the absence of stimulation. Currently, much more is understood about the mechanisms underlying action potential-evoked neurotransmission compared with spontaneous release. However, recent studies have shown selective modulation of spontaneous neurotransmission process by several neuromodulators, suggesting specific molecular regulation of spontaneous release. In this study, we identify copine-6 as a specific regulator of spontaneous neurotransmission. By both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, we show that copine-6 functions as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent suppressor of spontaneous release. These results further elucidate the mechanisms underlying differential regulation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;SALM1 (SALM (synaptic adhesion-like molecule), also known as LRFN2 (leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing), is a postsynaptic density (PSD)-95-interacting synaptic adhesion molecule implicated in the regulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) clustering largely based on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data, although its &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; functions remain unclear. Here, we found that mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (&lt;i&gt;Lrfn2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice) show a normal density of excitatory synapses but altered excitatory synaptic function, including enhanced NMDAR-dependent synaptic transmission but suppressed NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. Unexpectedly, SALM1 expression was detected in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and &lt;i&gt;Lrfn2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; CA1 pyramidal neurons showed decreases in the density of inhibitory synapses and the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, ultrasonic vocalization was suppressed in &lt;i&gt;Lrfn2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; pups separated from their mothers and acoustic startle was enhanced, but locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and learning and memory were largely normal in adult male &lt;i&gt;Lrfn2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, and social communication and startle behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and function, which govern neural circuit and brain functions. The SALM/LRFN (synaptic adhesion-like molecule/leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing) family of synaptic adhesion proteins consists of five known members for which the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; functions are largely unknown. Here, we characterized mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (SALM1 KO) known to associate with NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and found that these mice showed altered NMDAR-dependent synaptic transmission and plasticity, as expected, but unexpectedly also exhibited suppressed inhibitory synapse development and synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, SALM1 KO pups showed suppressed ultrasonic vocalization upon separation from their mothers and SALM1 KO adults showed enhanced responses to loud acoustic stimuli. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, social communication, and acoustic startle behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: nox2/cybb Deficiency Affects Zebrafish Retinotectal Connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked to neuronal polarity, axonal outgrowth, cerebellar development, regeneration of sensory axons, and neuroplasticity. However, the specific roles that individual Nox isoforms play during nervous system development &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remain unclear. To address this problem, we investigated the role of Nox activity in the development of retinotectal connections in zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish broadly express four &lt;i&gt;nox&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;nox1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;nox2/cybb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;nox5&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;duox&lt;/i&gt;) throughout the CNS during early development. Application of a pan-Nox inhibitor, celastrol, during the time of optic nerve (ON) outgrowth resulted in significant expansion of the ganglion cell layer (GCL), thinning of the ON, and a decrease in retinal axons reaching the optic tectum (OT). With the exception of GCL expansion, these effects were partially ameliorated by the addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a key ROS involved in Nox signaling. To address isoform-specific Nox functions, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mutations in each zebrafish &lt;i&gt;nox&lt;/i&gt; gene. We found that &lt;i&gt;nox2/cybb&lt;/i&gt; chimeric mutants displayed ON thinning and decreased OT innervation. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;nox2/cybb&lt;/i&gt; homozygous mutants (&lt;i&gt;nox2/cybb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) showed significant GCL expansion and mistargeted retinal axons in the OT. Neurite outgrowth from cultured zebrafish retinal ganglion cells was reduced by Nox inhibitors, suggesting a cell-autonomous role for Nox in these neurons. Collectively, our results show that Nox2/Cybb is important for retinotectal development in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most isoforms of NADPH oxidase (Nox) only produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when activated by an upstream signal, making them ideal candidates for ROS signaling. Nox enzymes are present in neurons and their activity has been shown to be important for neuronal development and function largely by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies. However, whether Nox is involved in the development of axons and formation of neuronal connections &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; has remained unclear. Using mutant zebrafish embryos, this study shows that a specific Nox isoform, Nox2/Cybb, is important for the establishment of axonal connections between retinal ganglion cells and the optic tectum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Preferential Targeting of Lateral Entorhinal Inputs onto Newly Integrated Granule Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5843?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mature dentate granule cells in the hippocampus receive input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path in precisely arranged lamina, with medial entorhinal axons innervating the middle molecular layer and lateral entorhinal cortex axons innervating the outer molecular layer. Although vastly outnumbered by mature granule cells, adult-generated newborn granule cells play a unique role in hippocampal function, which has largely been attributed to their enhanced excitability and plasticity (Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2007). Inputs from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex carry different informational content. Thus, the distribution of inputs onto newly integrated granule cells will affect their function in the circuit. Using retroviral labeling in combination with selective optogenetic activation of medial or lateral entorhinal inputs, we examined the functional innervation and synaptic maturation of newly generated dentate granule cells in the mouse hippocampus. Our results indicate that lateral entorhinal inputs provide the majority of functional innervation of newly integrated granule cells at 21 d postmitosis. Despite preferential functional targeting, the dendritic spine density of immature granule cells was similar in the outer and middle molecular layers, which we speculate could reflect an unequal distribution of shaft synapses. However, chronic blockade of neurotransmitter release of medial entorhinal axons with tetanus toxin disrupted normal synapse development of both medial and lateral entorhinal inputs. Our results support a role for preferential lateral perforant path input onto newly generated neurons in mediating pattern separation, but also indicate that medial perforant path input is necessary for normal synaptic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The formation of episodic memories involves the integration of contextual and spatial information. Newly integrated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus play a critical role in this process, despite constituting only a minor fraction of the total number of granule cells. Here we demonstrate that these neurons preferentially receive information thought to convey the context of an experience. Each newly integrated granule cell plays this unique role for ~1 month before reaching maturity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Extending the Time Domain of Neuronal Silencing with Cryptophyte Anion Channelrhodopsins</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic inhibition of specific neuronal types in the brain enables analysis of neural circuitry and is promising for the treatment of a number of neurological disorders. Anion channelrhodopsins from the cryptophyte alga &lt;i&gt;Guillardia theta&lt;/i&gt; generate larger photocurrents than other available inhibitory optogenetic tools, but more rapid channels are needed for temporally precise inhibition, such as single-spike suppression, of high-frequency firing neurons. Faster anion channelrhodopsins have been reported, but their potential advantages for time-resolved inhibitory optogenetics have not so far been verified in neurons. We report RapACR, nicknamed so for &quot;rapid&quot;, an anion channelrhodopsin from &lt;i&gt;Rhodomonas salina&lt;/i&gt;, that exhibits channel half-closing times below 10 ms and achieves equivalent inhibition at 50-fold lower light intensity in lentivirally transduced cultured mouse hippocampal neurons as the second-generation engineered Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting channelrhodopsin iC++. The upper limit of the time resolution of neuronal silencing with RapACR determined by measuring the dependence of spiking recovery after photoinhibition on the light intensity was calculated to be 100 Hz, whereas that with the faster of the two &lt;i&gt;Guillardia theta&lt;/i&gt; anion channelrhodopsins was 13 Hz. Further acceleration of RapACR channel kinetics was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis of a single residue in transmembrane helix 3 (Thr111 to Cys). We also show that mutation of another ACR (Cys to Ala at the same position) with a greatly extended lifetime of the channel open state acts as a bistable photochromic tool in mammalian neurons. These molecules extend the time domain of optogenetic neuronal silencing while retaining the high light sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;Guillardia&lt;/i&gt; ACRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We report both fast and slow variants of cryptophyte anion channelrhodopsins that enable efficient neuronal silencing with light in the expanded time window of 10 ms to tens of seconds. These tools can be used at low expression levels to avoid possible detrimental effects on the physiology of recipient cells and help to minimize light intensities to prevent overheating of the tissue in optogenetic experiments. Their potential applications include analysis of neuronal circuitry, the slow closing channel variant enabling measurements requiring an open channel in the dark amenable to optical imaging, and the development of optogenetic treatments for neurologic diseases involving neuron hyperexcitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Development of Parvalbumin-Expressing Basket Terminals in Layer II of the Rat Medial Entorhinal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0438-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC LII) generate multiple regular firing fields in response to the position and speed of an individual within the environment. They exhibit a protracted postnatal development and, in the adult, show activity differences along the dorsoventral axis (DVA). Evidence suggests parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) interneurons, most of which are perisomatic-targeting cells, play a crucial role in generation of the hexagonal grid cell activity pattern. We therefore hypothesized that the development and organization of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; perisomatic terminals in MEC LII reflect the postnatal emergence of the hexagonal firing pattern and dorsoventral differences seen in grid cell activity. We used immuno-electron microscopy to examine the development of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; perisomatic terminals and their target somata within dorsal and ventral MEC LII in rats of postnatal day (P)10, P15, and P30. We demonstrate that in dorsal and ventral MEC LII, the cross-sectional area of somata and number and density of perisomatic PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals increase between P10 and P15. A simultaneous decrease was observed in cross-sectional area of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals. Between P15 and P30, both MEC regions showed an increase in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminal size and percentage of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals containing mitochondria, which may enable grid cell activity to emerge and stabilize. We also report that dorsal somata are larger and apposed by more PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals than ventral somata at all stages, suggesting a protracted maturation in the ventral portion and a possible gradient in soma size and PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; basket innervation along the DVA in the adult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neurodynamic Evidence Supports a Forced-Excursion Model of Decision-Making under Speed/Accuracy Instructions</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary pressures suggest that choices should be optimized to maximize rewards, by appropriately trading speed for accuracy. This speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is commonly explained by variation in just the baseline-to-boundary distance, i.e., the excursion, of accumulation-to-bound models of perceptual decision-making. However, neural evidence is not consistent with this explanation. A compelling account of speeded choice should explain both overt behavior and the full range of associated brain signatures. Here, we reconcile seemingly contradictory behavioral and neural findings. In two variants of the same experiment, we triangulated upon the neural underpinnings of the SAT in the human brain using both EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that distinct neural signals, namely the event-related potential (ERP) centroparietal positivity (CPP) and a smoothed motor-evoked potential (MEP) signal, which have both previously been shown to relate to decision-related accumulation, revealed qualitatively similar average neurodynamic profiles with only subtle differences between SAT conditions. These signals were then modelled from behavior by either incorporating traditional boundary variation or utilizing a forced excursion. These model variants are mathematically equivalent, in terms of their behavioral predictions, hence providing identical fits to correct and erroneous reaction time distributions. However, the forced-excursion version instantiates SAT via a more global change in parameters and implied neural activity, a process conceptually akin to, but mathematically distinct from, urgency. This variant better captured both ERP and MEP neural profiles, suggesting that the SAT may be implemented via neural gain modulation, and reconciling standard modelling approaches with human neural data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal assemblies, loosely defined as subsets of neurons with reoccurring
spatio-temporally coordinated activation patterns, or &quot;motifs&quot;, are thought to
be building blocks of neural representations and information processing. We
here propose LeMoNADe, a new exploratory data analysis method that facilitates
hunting for motifs in calcium imaging videos, the dominant microscopic
functional imaging modality in neurophysiology. Our nonparametric method
extracts motifs directly from videos, bypassing the difficult intermediate step
of spike extraction. Our technique augments variational autoencoders with a
discrete stochastic node, and we show in detail how a differentiable
reparametrization and relaxation can be used. An evaluation on simulated data,
with available ground truth, reveals excellent quantitative performance. In
real video data acquired from brain slices, with no ground truth available,
LeMoNADe uncovers nontrivial candidate motifs that can help generate hypotheses
for more focused biological investigation.

	<description>In obesity, elevated insulin causes fatty liver by activating the gene encoding SREBP-1c, a transcription factor that enhances fatty acid synthesis. Two transcription factors, LXRα and C/EBPβ, are necessary but not sufficient for insulin induction of hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA. Here, we show that a third transcription factor, BHLHE40, is required. Immunoprecipitation revealed that BHLHE40 binds to C/EBPβ and LXRα in livers of rats that had fasted and then refed. Hepatic BHLHE40 mRNA rises rapidly when fasted rats are refed and when rat hepatocytes are incubated with insulin. Preventing this rise by gene knockout in mice or siRNAs in hepatocytes reduces the insulin-induced rise in SREBP-1c mRNA. Although BHLHE40 is necessary for insulin induction of SREBP-1c, it is not sufficient as demonstrated by failure of lentiviral BHLHE40 overexpression to increase hepatocyte SREBP-1c mRNA in the absence of insulin. Thus, an additional event is required for insulin to increase SREBP-1c mRNA.</description>

	<description>Understanding the fate of exogenous cells after implantation is important for clinical applications. Preclinical studies allow imaging of cell location and survival. Labelling with nanoparticles enables high sensitivity detection, but cell division and cell death cause signal dilution and false positives. By contrast, genetic reporter signals are amplified by cell division. Here, we characterise lentivirus-based bi-cistronic reporter gene vectors and silica-coated gold nanorods (GNRs) as synergistic tools for cell labelling and tracking. Co-expression of the bioluminescence reporter luciferase and the optoacoustic reporter near-infrared fluorescent protein iRFP720 enabled cell tracking over time in mice. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) showed immediate biodistribution of GNR-labelled cells after intracardiac injection and successive clearance of GNRs (day 1–15) with high resolution, while optoacoustic iRFP720 detection indicated tumour growth (day 10–40). This multimodal cell tracking approach could be applied widely for cancer and regenerative medicine research to monitor short- and long-term biodistribution, tumour formation and metastasis.</description>

	<description>Does our understanding of the human brain remain incomplete without a proper understanding of how the brain processes music? Here, the author makes a passionate plea for the use of music in the investigation of human emotion and its brain correlates, arguing that music can change activity in all brain structures associated with emotions, which has important implications on how we understand human emotions and their disorders and how we can make better use of beneficial effects of music in therapy.</description>

This paper presents a data analysis framework to uncover relationships between health conditions, age and sex for a large population of patients. We study a massive heterogeneous sample of 1.7 million patients in Brazil, containing 47 million of health records with detailed medical conditions for visits to medical facilities for a period of 17 months. The findings suggest that medical conditions can be grouped into clusters that share very distinctive densities in the ages of the patients. For each cluster, we further present the ICD-10 chapters within it. Finally, we relate the findings to comorbidity networks, uncovering the relation of the discovered clusters of age densities to comorbidity networks literature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5diqBMl6Y-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>In ∼30% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas whose disease progresses on EGFR inhibitors, the basis for acquired resistance remains unclear. We have integrated transposon mutagenesis screening in an EGFR-mutant cell line and clinical genomic sequencing in cases of acquired resistance to identify mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/jyaCw0y3Wvk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The intravascular processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins depends on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and GPIHBP1, a membrane protein of endothelial cells that binds LPL within the subendothelial spaces and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. In the absence of GPIHBP1, LPL remains mislocalized within the subendothelial spaces, causing severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia). The...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/2ONU19MISyY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Cancer genomics has produced extensive information on cancer-associated genes, but the number and specificity of cancer-driver mutations remains a matter of debate. We constructed a bipartite network in which 7,665 tumors from 30 cancer types are connected via shared mutations in 198 previously identified cancer genes. We show that about...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/gCTp3iydN-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Colorectal cancer patients often relapse after chemotherapy, owing to the survival of stem or progenitor cells referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Although tumor stromal factors are known to contribute to chemoresistance, it remains not fully understood how CSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment escape the chemotherapy. Here, we...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/t0NCSgrtmMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Diverse insects are associated with ancient bacterial symbionts, whose genomes have often suffered drastic reduction and degeneration. In extreme cases, such symbiont genomes seem almost unable to sustain the basic cellular functioning, which comprises an open question in the evolution of symbiosis.

	<description>Intraspecific population diversity (specifically, spatial asynchrony of population dynamics) is an essential component of metapopulation stability and persistence in nature. In 2D systems, theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size (or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics. However,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/VBAX88bG74g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Stimulation of cells with TNFα can promote distinct cell death pathways, including RIPK1-independent apoptosis, necroptosis, and RIPK1-dependent apoptosis (RDA)—the latter of which we still know little about. Here we show that RDA involves the rapid formation of a distinct detergent-insoluble, highly ubiquitinated, and activated RIPK1 pool, termed “iuRIPK1.” iuRIPK1 forms...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/SbWmb8em6Hc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Degeneration of retinal astrocytes precedes hypoxia-driven pathologic neovascularization and vascular leakage in ischemic retinopathies. However, the molecular events that underlie astrocyte loss remain unclear. Astrocytes abundantly express connexin 43 (Cx43), a transmembrane protein that forms gap junction (GJ) channels and hemichannels. Cx channels can transfer toxic signals from dying cells...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/IL0FrKMS0Mk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Rapela (2016) we reported traveling waves (TWs) on electrocorticographic
(ECoG) recordings from an epileptic subject over speech processing brain
regions, while the subject rhythmically produced consonant-vowel syllables
(CVSs). In Rapela (2017) we showed that TWs are precisely synchronized, in
dynamical systems terms, to these productions. Here we show that TWs do not
occur continuously, but tend to appear before the initiation of CVSs and tend
to disappear before their termination. During moments of silence, between
productions of CVSs, TWs tend to reverse direction. To our knowledge, this is
the first study showing TWs related to the production of speech and, more
generally, the first report of behavioral correlates of mesoscale TWs in
behaving humans.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cross-paradigm pretraining of convolutional networks improves intracranial EEG decoding. (arXiv:1806.09532v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the classification of brain signals in real-life
applications, the training and the prediction data are often described by
different distributions. Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from
various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact
that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts
reinforces the need for techniques to generalize learned information, as
performances of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are enhanced by increasing
quantity of disposable data. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to a
framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove
the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across
different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the
usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only
little data can be used to distinguish between erroneous and correct
realization of a task. This effect could be delimited from a transfer of merely
general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of
error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in
time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal
correlations between the two different paradigms. Decoding on the intracranial
data without pre-transfer reaches median accuracies of $(76.94 \pm 2.17)\,\%$
and $(81.50 \pm 9.49)\,\%$, respectively.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Measuring Integrated Information: Comparison of Candidate Measures in Theory and Simulation. (arXiv:1806.09373v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a prominent theory of consciousness
that has at its centre measures that quantify the extent to which a system
generates more information than the sum of its parts. While several candidate
measures of integrated information (`$\Phi$') now exist, little is known about
how they compare, especially in terms of their behaviour on non-trivial network
models. In this article we provide clear and intuitive descriptions of six
distinct candidate measures. We then explore the properties of each of these
measures in simulation on networks consisting of eight interacting nodes,
animated with Gaussian linear autoregressive dynamics. We find a striking
diversity in the behaviour of these measures -- no two measures show consistent
agreement across all analyses. Further, only a subset of the measures appear to
genuinely reflect some form of dynamical complexity, in the sense of
simultaneous segregation and integration between system components. Our results
help guide the operationalisation of IIT and advance the development of
measures of integrated information that may have more general applicability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A temporal neural network model for object recognition using a biologically plausible decision making layer. (arXiv:1806.09334v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09334</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain can recognize different objects as ones that it has experienced before.
The recognition accuracy and it's processing time depends on task properties
such as viewing condition, level of noise and etc. Recognition accuracy can be
well explained by different models. However, less attention has been paid to
the processing time and the ones that do, are not biologically plausible. By
extracting features temporally as well as utilizing an accumulation to bound
decision making model, an object recognition model accounting for both
recognition time and accuracy is proposed. To temporally extract informative
features in support of possible classes of stimuli, a hierarchical spiking
neural network, called spiking HMAX is modified. In the decision making part of
the model the extracted information accumulates over time using accumulator
units. The input category is determined as soon as any of the accumulators
reaches a threshold, called decision bound. Results show that not only does the
model follow human accuracy in a psychophysics task better than the classic
spiking HMAX model, but also it predicts human response time in each choice.
Results also provide enough evidence that temporal representation of features
are informative since they can improve the accuracy over time which is in line
with the well-known idea of speed accuracy trade-off in decision making
studies.

	<description>Antibodies acquired naturally through repeated exposure to &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; are essential in the control of blood-stage malaria. Antibody-dependent functions may include neutralization of parasite–host interactions, complement activation, and activation of Fc receptor functions. A role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in protection from malaria has not been established. Here we show that IgG isolated from adults living in a malaria-endemic region activated ADCC by primary human NK cells, which lysed infected red blood cells (RBCs) and inhibited parasite growth in an in vitro assay for ADCC-dependent growth inhibition. RBC lysis by NK cells was highly selective for infected RBCs in a mixed culture with uninfected RBCs. Human antibodies to &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN were sufficient to promote NK-dependent growth inhibition. As these results implicate acquired immunity through NK-mediated ADCC, antibody-based vaccines that target bloodstream parasites should consider this new mechanism of action.</description>

	<description>A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. We find that the behavioral response is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals, like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores all tested mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a linear-nonlinear model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to stimulus.</description>

	<description>Polarised mRNA transport is a prevalent mechanism for spatial control of protein synthesis. However, the composition of transported ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and the regulation of their movement are poorly understood. We have reconstituted microtubule minus end-directed transport of mRNAs using purified components. A Bicaudal-D (BicD) adaptor protein and the RNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) are sufficient for long-distance mRNA transport by the dynein motor and its accessory complex dynactin, thus defining a minimal transport-competent RNP. Unexpectedly, the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting RNA localisation signal promotes the interaction of Egl with BicD, which licenses the latter protein to recruit dynein and dynactin. Our data support a model for BicD activation based on RNA-induced occupancy of two Egl-binding sites on the BicD dimer. Scaffolding of adaptor protein assemblies by cargoes is an attractive mechanism for regulating intracellular transport.</description>

	<description>We investigated the role of full-length &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Bicaudal D (BicD) binding partners in dynein-dynactin activation for mRNA transport on microtubules. Full-length BicD robustly activated dynein-dynactin motility only when both the mRNA binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) and &lt;i&gt;K10&lt;/i&gt; mRNA cargo were present, and electron microscopy showed that both Egl and mRNA were needed to disrupt a looped, auto-inhibited BicD conformation. BicD can recruit two dimeric dyneins, resulting in faster speeds and longer runs than with one dynein. Moving complexes predominantly contained two Egl molecules and one &lt;i&gt;K10&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. This mRNA-bound configuration makes Egl bivalent, likely enhancing its avidity for BicD and thus its ability to disrupt BicD auto-inhibition. Consistent with this idea, artificially dimerized Egl activates dynein-dynactin-BicD in the absence of mRNA. The ability of mRNA cargo to orchestrate the activation of the mRNP (messenger ribonucleotide protein) complex is an elegant way to ensure that only cargo-bound motors are motile.</description>

	<description>Chromatin looping controls gene expression by regulating promoter-enhancer contacts, the spread of epigenetic modifications, and the segregation of the genome into transcriptionally active and inactive compartments. We studied the impact on the structure and expression of host chromatin by the human retrovirus HTLV-1. We show that HTLV-1 disrupts host chromatin structure by forming loops between the provirus and the host genome; certain loops depend on the critical chromatin architectural protein CTCF, which we recently discovered binds to the HTLV-1 provirus. We show that the provirus causes two distinct patterns of abnormal transcription of the host genome in cis: bidirectional transcription in the host genome immediately flanking the provirus, and clone-specific transcription in cis at non-contiguous loci up to &amp;gt;300 kb from the integration site. We conclude that HTLV-1 causes insertional mutagenesis up to the megabase range in the host genome in &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; persistently-maintained HTLV-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell clones in vivo.</description>

	<description>In most animals, the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect's movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons, we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.</description>

	<description>In most animals, the brain controls the body via a set of descending neurons (DNs) that traverse the neck. DN activity activates, maintains or modulates locomotion and other behaviors. Individual DNs have been well-studied in species from insects to primates, but little is known about overall connectivity patterns across the DN population. We systematically investigated DN anatomy in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and created over 100 transgenic lines targeting individual cell types. We identified roughly half of all &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; DNs and comprehensively map connectivity between sensory and motor neuropils in the brain and nerve cord, respectively. We find the nerve cord is a layered system of neuropils reflecting the fly’s capability for two largely independent means of locomotion -- walking and flight -- using distinct sets of appendages. Our results reveal the basic functional map of descending pathways in flies and provide tools for systematic interrogation of neural circuits.</description>

	<description>Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is crucial for signaling mediated by stress-induced high levels of glucocorticoids. The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is a key structure underlying auditory-cued fear conditioning. Here, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of GR in the LA (LAGRKO) resulted in an auditory-cued fear memory deficit for strengthened conditioning. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of a single restraint stress (RS) prior to conditioning on auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR (control) mice was abolished in LAGRKO mice. Optogenetic induction of long-term depression (LTD) at auditory inputs to the LA reduced auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, and in contrast, optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) increased auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR mice. These findings suggest that prior stress suppresses fear conditioning-induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA in a GR-dependent manner, thereby protecting animals from encoding excessive cued fear memory under stress conditions.</description>

Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples is a very promising method for the diagnosis of human infections. Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0K1XU9oCec&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k_dQmqkjXl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The impact of temporal sampling resolution on parameter inference for biological transport models</title>

Imaging data has become an essential tool to explore key biological questions at various scales, for example the motile behaviour of bacteria or the transport of mRNA, and it has the potential to transform our understanding of important transport mechanisms. Often these imaging studies require us to compare biological species or mutants, and to do this we need to quantitatively characterise their behaviour. Mathematical models offer a quantitative description of a system that enables us to perform this comparison, but to relate mechanistic mathematical models to imaging data, we need to estimate their parameters. In this work we study how collecting data at different temporal resolutions impacts our ability to infer parameters of biological transport models; performing exact inference for simple velocity jump process models in a Bayesian framework. The question of how best to choose the frequency with which data is collected is prominent in a host of studies because the majority of imaging technologies place constraints on the frequency with which images can be taken, and the discrete nature of observations can introduce errors into parameter estimates. In this work, we mitigate such errors by formulating the velocity jump process model within a hidden states framework. This allows us to obtain estimates of the reorientation rate and noise amplitude for noisy observations of a simple velocity jump process. We demonstrate the sensitivity of these estimates to temporal variations in the sampling resolution and extent of measurement noise. We use our methodology to provide experimental guidelines for researchers aiming to characterise motile behaviour that can be described by a velocity jump process. In particular, we consider how experimental constraints resulting in a trade-off between temporal sampling resolution and observation noise may affect parameter estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our methodology to model misspecification, and then apply our inference framework to a dataset that was generated with the aim of understanding the localization of RNA-protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bJ09RqwTbkw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Systemic and Intra-Habenular Activation of the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR139 Decreases Compulsive-like Alcohol Drinking and Hyperalgesia in Alcohol-Dependent Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0153-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest expression in the habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in dependent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; GPR139 has been identified as a receptor with high expression in a key brain region for addiction, the habenula. However, no studies have yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. This study found that GPR139 receptor activation reduced alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats with compulsive-like drinking and decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia. Importantly, we found that the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus was a mediator of the observed effects. These results represent an important advance in the field because they are the first to demonstrate a role for GPR139 in addiction-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Facilitated Event-Related Power-Modulations during Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) Revealed by Concurrent tACS-MEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0069-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive approaches to modulate oscillatory activity in the brain are increasingly popular in the scientific community. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations in a frequency specific manner. However, due to a massive stimulation artifact at the targeted frequency, little is known about effects of tACS during stimulation. It remains unclear how the continuous application of tACS affects event-related oscillations during cognitive tasks. Depending on whether tACS influences pre- or post-stimulus oscillations, or both, the endogenous, event-related oscillatory dynamics could be pushed in various directions or not at all. A better understanding of these effects is crucial to plan, predict and understand outcomes of solely behavioral tACS experiments. In the present study, a recently proposed procedure to suppress tACS artifacts by projecting MEG data into source-space using spatial filtering was utilized to recover event-related power modulations in the alpha-band during a mental rotation task. MEG data of twenty-five human subjects was continuously recorded. After 10 a minute baseline measurement, participants received either 20 minutes of tACS at their individual alpha frequency, or sham stimulation. Another 40 minutes of MEG data were acquired thereafter. Data were projected into source-space and carefully examined for residual artifacts. Results revealed strong facilitation of event-related power modulations in the alpha-band during tACS application. These results provide first direct evidence, that tACS does not counteract top-down suppression of intrinsic oscillations, but rather enhances pre-existent power modulations within the range of the individual alpha (=stimulation) frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience to study the causal role of brain oscillations for cognition. However, online effects of tACS largely remain a ‘black box’ due to an intense electromagnetic artifact encountered during stimulation. The current study is the first to employ a spatial filtering approach to recover, and systematically study, event-related oscillatory dynamics during tACS, which could potentially be altered in various directions. TACS facilitated pre-existing patterns of oscillatory dynamics during the employed mental rotation task, but did not counteract or overwrite them. In addition, control analyses and a measure to quantify tACS artifact suppression are provided that can enrich future studies investigating tACS online effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A probabilistic atlas of the human thalamic nuclei combining ex vivo MRI and histology. (arXiv:1806.08634v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08634</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08634</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly
specific nuclei. Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and
to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great
interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and
connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas
of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological
data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The
atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial
histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual
segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate,
putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The
3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations
was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface
photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas,
which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with
with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of
representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using
Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability,
robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential
thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas
and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the
neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.

	<description>Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis, folding, quality control, and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network, and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response (UPR), the main mechanism that copes with ER stress, plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors, in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity, synapse formation, and neuronal plasticity.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Transmission of temporally correlated spike trains through synapses with short-term depression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alex D. Bird, Magnus J. E. Richardson&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term synaptic depression, caused by depletion of releasable neurotransmitter, modulates the strength of neuronal connections in a history-dependent manner. Quantifying the statistics of synaptic transmission requires stochastic models that link probabilistic neurotransmitter release with presynaptic spike-train statistics. Common approaches are to model the presynaptic spike train as either regular or a memory-less Poisson process: few analytical results are available that describe depressing synapses when the afferent spike train has more complex, temporally correlated statistics such as bursts. Here we present a series of analytical results—from vesicle release-site occupancy statistics, via neurotransmitter release, to the post-synaptic voltage mean and variance—for depressing synapses driven by correlated presynaptic spike trains. The class of presynaptic drive considered is that fully characterised by the inter-spike-interval distribution and encompasses a broad range of models used for neuronal circuit and network analyses, such as integrate-and-fire models with a complete post-spike reset and receiving sufficiently short-time correlated drive. We further demonstrate that the derived post-synaptic voltage mean and variance allow for a simple and accurate approximation of the firing rate of the post-synaptic neuron, using the exponential integrate-and-fire model as an example. These results extend the level of biological detail included in models of synaptic transmission and will allow for the incorporation of more complex and physiologically relevant firing patterns into future studies of neuronal networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErLjrQIgZpU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a forefront actor in the transport of lipids and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, and is also strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Upon lipid-binding apoE adopts a conformational state that mediates the receptor-induced internalization of lipoproteins. Due to its inherent structural dynamics and the presence of lipids, the structure of the biologically active apoE remains so far poorly described. To address this issue, we developed an innovative hybrid method combining experimental data with molecular modeling and dynamics to generate comprehensive models of the lipidated apoE4 isoform. Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry provided distance restraints, characterizing the three-dimensional organization of apoE4 molecules at the surface of lipidic nanoparticles. The ensemble of spatial restraints was then rationalized in an original molecular modeling approach to generate monomeric models of apoE4 that advocated the existence of two alternative conformations. These two models point towards an activation mechanism of apoE4 relying on a regulation of the accessibility of its receptor binding region. Further, molecular dynamics simulations of the dimerized and lipidated apoE4 monomeric conformations revealed an elongation of the apoE N-terminal domain, whereby helix 4 is rearranged, together with Arg172, into a proper orientation essential for lipoprotein receptor association. Overall, our results show how apoE4 adapts its conformation for the recognition of the low density lipoprotein receptor and we propose a novel mechanism of activation for apoE4 that is based on accessibility and remodeling of the receptor binding region.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dL-J_TXfeus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The principles of neural encoding and computations are inherently collective
and usually involve large populations of interacting neurons with highly
correlated activities. While theories of neural function have long recognized
the importance of collective effects in populations of neurons, only in the
past two decades has it become possible to record from many cells
simulatenously using advanced experimental techniques with single-spike
resolution, and to relate these correlations to function and behaviour. This
review focuses on the modeling and inference approaches that have been recently
developed to describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of
neurons. We cover a variety of models describing correlations between pairs of
neurons as well as between larger groups, synchronous or delayed in time, with
or without the explicit influence of the stimulus, and including or not latent
variables. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks or each method, as well as
the computational challenges related to their application to recordings of ever
larger populations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The artificial axon is a recently introduced synthetic assembly of supported
lipid bilayers and voltage gated ion channels, displaying the basic
electrophysiology of nerve cells. Here we demonstrate the use of two artificial
axons as control elements to achieve a simple task. Namely, we steer a remote
control car towards a light source, using the sensory input dependent firing
rate of the axons as the control signal for turning left or right. We present
the result in the form of the analysis of a movie of the car approaching the
light source. In general terms, with this work we pursue a constructivist
approach to exploring the nexus between machine language at the nerve cell
level and behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07998</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral fluid dynamics require a reverse energy mechanism to transport water
and metabolites from tissue into veins. Recent findings in active flow of
bacteria have shown that such a mechanism involving backward energy cascades,
so-called inverse cascades may exist only during spontaneously broken
mirror-symmetries. Here, we wanted to investigate whether and, if so when
symmetries break during a heart cycle. We used multiple spin echos (MSE)s in
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which can detect broken spherical symmetries.
We found MSEs in brain tissue which appeared during arterial pulsation in a
highly synchronized fashion in most parts of the brain. The timing suggests
that the reverse energy flow is initiated during the energy injection of the
heartbeat and ends with the isovolumetric vessel contraction. This interleaved
process may explain how the illusive pulse wave traveling through the brain
emerges as well as underlying principles of cerebral autoregulation and
neurovascular coupling.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Storing knowledge of an agent's environment in the form of a probabilistic
generative model has been established as a crucial ingredient in a multitude of
cognitive tasks. Perception has been formalised as probabilistic inference over
the state of latent variables, whereas in decision making the model of the
environment is used to predict likely consequences of actions. Such generative
models have earlier been proposed to underlie semantic memory but it remained
unclear if this model also underlies the efficient storage of experiences in
episodic memory. We formalise the compression of episodes in the normative
framework of information theory and argue that semantic memory provides the
distortion function for compression of experiences. Recent advances and
insights from machine learning allow us to approximate semantic compression in
naturalistic domains and contrast the resulting deviations in compressed
episodes with memory errors observed in the experimental literature on human
memory.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Global integration of information in the brain results from complex
interactions of segregated brain networks. Identifying the most influential
neuronal populations that efficiently bind these networks is a fundamental
problem of systems neuroscience. Here we apply optimal percolation theory and
pharmacogenetic interventions in-vivo to predict and subsequently target nodes
that are essential for global integration of a memory network in rodents. The
theory predicts that integration in the memory network is mediated by a set of
low-degree nodes located in the nucleus accumbens. This result is confirmed
with pharmacogenetic inactivation of the nucleus accumbens, which eliminates
the formation of the memory network, while inactivations of other brain areas
leave the network intact. Thus, optimal percolation theory predicts essential
nodes in brain networks. This could be used to identify targets of
interventions to modulate brain function.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to integrate information into a unified coherent whole is a
fundamental capacity of many biological and cognitive systems. Integrated
Information Theory (IIT) provides a mathematical approach to quantify the level
of integration in a system. Nevertheless, it is not yet well understood how
integration scales up with the size of a system or with different temporal
scales of activity, nor how a system maintains its integration as its interacts
with its environment. We argue that modelling and understanding how measures of
information integration operate in these scenarios is fundamental to adequately
capture integration in systems such as the brain. We propose a simplified and
modified version of integrated information {\phi} in order to explore these
questions. Using mean field approximations, we measure {\phi} in a kinetic
Ising models of infinite size. We find that information integration diverges in
some cases when the system is near critical points in continuous phase
transitions. Moreover, we find that we can delimit the boundary of a system
with respect to its environment by comparing the divergent integrative
tendencies of system and system-environment processes respectively. Finally, we
model a system that maintains integrated information when interacting with a
range of different environments by generating a critical surface spanning a
parametric region of the environment. We conclude by discussing how thinking
about integrated information in the thermodynamic limit opens fruitful research
avenues for studying the organization of biological and cognitive systems.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Control of neurite growth and guidance by an inhibitory cell-body signal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006218</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Brendan A. Bicknell, Zac Pujic, Peter Dayan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill&lt;/p&gt;

The development of a functional nervous system requires tight control of neurite growth and guidance by extracellular chemical cues. Neurite growth is astonishingly sensitive to shallow concentration gradients, but a widely observed feature of both growth and guidance regulation, with important consequences for development and regeneration, is that both are only elicited over the same relatively narrow range of concentrations. Here we show that all these phenomena can be explained within one theoretical framework. We first test long-standing explanations for the suppression of the trophic effects of nerve growth factor at high concentrations, and find they are contradicted by experiment. Instead we propose a new hypothesis involving inhibitory signalling among the cell bodies, and then extend this hypothesis to show how both growth and guidance can be understood in terms of a common underlying signalling mechanism. This new model for the first time unifies several key features of neurite growth regulation, quantitatively explains many aspects of experimental data, and makes new predictions about unknown details of developmental signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_iAROQSe6Po&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Community interactions and spatial structure shape selection on antibiotic resistant lineages</title>

Polymicrobial interactions play an important role in shaping the outcome of antibiotic treatment, yet how multispecies communities respond to antibiotic assault is still little understood. Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LJhLUT2wYlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Solving the RNA design problem with reinforcement learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006176</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Eastman, Jade Shi, Bharath Ramsundar, Vijay S. Pande&lt;/p&gt;

We use reinforcement learning to train an agent for computational RNA design: given a target secondary structure, design a sequence that folds to that structure &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;. Our agent uses a novel graph convolutional architecture allowing a single model to be applied to arbitrary target structures of any length. After training it on randomly generated targets, we test it on the Eterna100 benchmark and find it outperforms all previous algorithms. Analysis of its solutions shows it has successfully learned some advanced strategies identified by players of the game Eterna, allowing it to solve some very difficult structures. On the other hand, it has failed to learn other strategies, possibly because they were not required for the targets in the training set. This suggests the possibility that future improvements to the training protocol may yield further gains in performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNWGqeRtEb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A framework for large-scale evaluation of deep learning for EEG. (arXiv:1806.07741v1 [eess.SP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;EEG is the most common signal source for noninvasive BCI applications. For
such applications, the EEG signal needs to be decoded and translated into
appropriate actions. A recently emerging EEG decoding approach is deep learning
with Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs, RNNs) with many
different architectures already published. Here we present a novel framework
for the large-scale evaluation of different deep-learning architectures on
different EEG datasets. This framework comprises (i) a collection of EEG
datasets currently comprising 100 examples (recording sessions) from six
different classification problems, (ii) a collection of different EEG decoding
algorithms, and (iii) a wrapper linking the decoders to the data as well as
handling structured documentation of all settings and (hyper-) parameters and
statistics, designed to ensure transparency and reproducibility. As an
applications example we used our framework by comparing three publicly
available CNN architectures: the Braindecode Deep4 ConvNet, Braindecode Shallow
ConvNet, and EEGNet. We also show how our framework can be used to study
similarities and differences in the performance of different decoding methods
across tasks. We argue that the deep learning EEG framework as described here
could help to tap the full potential of deep learning for BCI applications.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Theta Oscillations Index Frontal Decision-Making and Mediate Reciprocal Frontal–Parietal Interactions in Willed Attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy149</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy149/5041999?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals, biased by learning or reward, or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this “willed attention.” In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at ~500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal–parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Quantitative Three-Dimensional Reconstructions of Excitatory Synaptic Boutons in Layer 5 of the Adult Human Temporal Lobe Neocortex: A Fine-Scale Electron Microscopic Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of synapses are available for different brain regions of several animal species including non-human primates, but comparatively little is known about their quantitative morphology in humans. Here, synaptic boutons in Layer 5 (L5) of the human temporal lobe (TL) neocortex were investigated in biopsy tissue, using fine-scale electron microscopy, and quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions. The size and organization of the presynaptic active zones (PreAZs), postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and that of the 3 distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were particularly analyzed. L5 synaptic boutons were medium-sized (~6 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with a single but relatively large PreAZ (~0.3 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They contained a total of ~1500 SVs/bouton, ~20 constituting the putative readily releasable pool (RRP), ~180 the recycling pool (RP), and the remainder, the resting pool. The PreAZs, PSDs, and vesicle pools are ~3-fold larger than those of CNS synapses in other species. Astrocytic processes reached the synaptic cleft and may regulate the glutamate concentration. Profound differences exist between synapses in human TL neocortex and those described in various species, particularly in the size and geometry of PreAZs and PSDs, the large RRP/RP, and the astrocytic ensheathment suggesting high synaptic efficacy, strength, and modulation of synaptic transmission at human synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Toward Task Connectomics: Examining Whole-Brain Task Modulated Connectivity in Different Task Domains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy055</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy055/5042007?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI, which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome, is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Attention can be “covertly” directed without eye movements; yet, even during fixation, there are microsaccades. We found that neural activity was enhanced by attention, but only following a microsaccade toward the stimulus, revealing a major link between covert attention and the oculomotor system.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age Differentiation within Gray Matter, White Matter, and between Memory and White Matter in an Adult Life Span Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5826?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5826?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is well established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the life span. A long-standing hypothesis called &quot;age differentiation&quot; additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date, however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multigroup structural equation models (SEMs) and SEM trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult life span (18–88 years) in a large (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cam-can.org&quot;&gt;www.cam-can.org&lt;/a&gt;). After factor analyses of gray matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted MRI) and white matter organization (fractional anisotropy from diffusion-weighted MRI), we found evidence for the differentiation of gray and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation among fluid intelligence, language, and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern among cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with the reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships among cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (dedifferentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult life span sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change among cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language, and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Inhibition of CGRP{alpha} Sensory Neurons Reveals Their Distinct Roles in Neuropathic and Incisional Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5807?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous somatosensory neurons convey innocuous and noxious mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli from peripheral tissues to the CNS. Among these are nociceptive neurons that express calcitonin gene-related peptide-α (CGRPα). The role of peripheral CGRPα neurons (CANs) in acute and injury-induced pain has been studied using diphtheria toxin ablation, but their functional roles remain controversial. Because ablation permanently deletes a neuronal population, compensatory changes may ensue that mask the physiological or pathophysiological roles of CANs, particularly for injuries that occur after ablation. Therefore, we sought to define the role of intact CANs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; under baseline and injury conditions by using noninvasive transient optogenetic inhibition. We assessed pain behavior longitudinally from acute to chronic time points. We generated adult male and female mice that selectively express the outward rectifying proton pump archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) in CANs, and inhibited their peripheral cutaneous terminals in models of neuropathic (spared nerve injury) and inflammatory (skin-muscle incision) pain using transdermal light activation of Arch. After nerve injury, brief activation of Arch reversed the chronic mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity, alleviated the spontaneous pain, and reversed the sensitized mechanical currents in primary afferent somata. In contrast, Arch inhibition of CANs did not alter incision-induced hypersensitivity. Instead, incision-induced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity was alleviated by peripheral blockade of CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling. These results reveal that CANs have distinct roles in the time course of pain during neuropathic and incisional injuries and suggest that targeting peripheral CANs or CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling could selectively treat neuropathic or postoperative pain, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The contribution of sensory afferent CGRPα neurons (CANs) to neuropathic and inflammatory pain is controversial. Here, we left CANs intact during neuropathic and perioperative incision injury by using transient transdermal optogenetic inhibition of CANs. We found that peripheral CANs are required for neuropathic mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity, spontaneous pain, and sensitization of mechanical currents in afferent somata. However, they are dispensable for incisional pain transmission. In contrast, peripheral pharmacological inhibition of CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling alleviated the incisional mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, but had no effect on neuropathic pain. These results show that CANs have distinct roles in neuropathic and incisional pain and suggest that their targeting via novel peripheral treatments may selectively alleviate neuropathic versus incisional pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuroanatomy of the vmPFC and dlPFC Predicts Individual Differences in Cognitive Regulation During Dietary Self-Control Across Regulation Strategies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Making healthy food choices is challenging for many people. Individuals differ greatly in their ability to follow health goals in the face of temptation, but it is unclear what underlies such differences. Using voxel-based morphometry, we investigated in healthy humans (i.e., men and women) the links between structural variation in gray matter volume and individuals' level of success in shifting toward healthier food choices. We combined MRI and choice data into a joint dataset by pooling across three independent studies that used a task prompting participants to explicitly focus on the healthiness of food items before making their food choices. Within this dataset, we found that individual differences in gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) predicted regulatory success. We extended and confirmed these initial findings by predicting regulatory success out of sample and across tasks in a second dataset requiring participants to apply a different regulation strategy that entailed distancing from cravings for unhealthy, appetitive foods. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical markers in the vmPFC and dlPFC generalized to different forms of dietary regulation strategies across participant groups. They provide novel evidence that structural differences in neuroanatomy of two key regions for valuation and its control, the vmPFC and dlPFC, predict an individual's ability to exert control in dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dieting involves regulating food choices to eat healthier foods and fewer unhealthy foods. People differ dramatically in their ability to achieve or maintain this regulation, but it is unclear why. Here, we show that individuals with more gray matter volume in the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are better at exercising dietary self-control. This relationship was observed across four different studies examining two different forms of dietary self-regulation, suggesting that neuroanatomical differences in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may represent a general marker for self-control abilities. These results identify candidate neuroanatomical markers for dieting success and failure, and suggest potential targets for therapies aimed at preventing or treating obesity and related eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neurons Specifically Activated by Fear Learning in Lateral Amygdala Display Increased Synaptic Strength</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-&lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt; regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a &lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tau-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons when compared to non-activated &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on β-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Developing animals must begin to interact with the world before their neural development is complete. This means they must build neural codes appropriate for turning sensory inputs into motor outputs adaptively as their neural hardware matures. We review some recent progress in the understanding of the relationship between neural coding and neural circuit development. We focus particularly on neural coding in the context of topographic maps and spontaneous activity, as well as receptive field and circuit development, drawing on examples from both mammalian visual cortex and fish optic tectum.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems modelling of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network predicts and prioritizes synergistic drug combinations for triple-negative breast cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006192</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Young Shin, Anna-Katharina Müller, Nandini Verma, Sima Lev, Lan K. Nguyen&lt;/p&gt;

Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lYpC_ByFRf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behavior in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of dSTIM, Ral, or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral-mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mushroom body (MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory, although exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here, we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in the boutons and conditioned behavioral responses to learned odors in honeybees. We found that the absolute amount of the neural change for the rewarded but not for the unrewarded odor was correlated with the behavioral learning rate across individuals. The temporal profile of the induced changes matched with odor response dynamics of the MB-associated inhibitory neurons, suggestive of activity modulation of boutons by this neural class. We hypothesize the circuit-specific neural plasticity relates to the learned value of the stimulus and underlies the conditioned behavior of the bees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Increasing Motor Noise Impairs Reinforcement Learning in Healthy Individuals</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Motor variability from exploration is crucial for reinforcement learning as it allows the nervous system to find new task solutions. However, motor variability from noise can be detrimental to learning and may underlie slowed reinforcement learning performance observed in individuals with cerebellar damage. Here we examine whether artificially increasing noise in healthy individuals slows reinforcement learning in a similar manner to that seen in cerebellar patients. Participants used binary reinforcement to learn to rotate their reach angle in a series of directions. By comparing task performance between conditions with different levels of added noise, we show that adding a high level of noise – matched to a group of cerebellar patients – slows learning. In additional experiments we show that the detrimental effect of noise may lie in reinforcing incorrect behavior, rather than not reinforcing correct behavior. By comparing performance between healthy participants with added noise and a group of cerebellar patients, we found that added noise does not slow the control group’s learning to the same degree observed in the patient group. Using a mechanistic model, we show that added noise in the present study matched patients’ motor noise and total learning. However, increased exploration in the control group relative to the cerebellar group supports faster learning. Our results suggest that motor noise slows reinforcement learning by impairing the mapping of reward to the correct action and this may underlie deficits induced by cerebellar damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the contribution of reinforcement mechanisms to human motor learning has been the subject of renewed interest. Exploration (i.e. varying one’s movement) is crucial to reinforcement learning. Yet, motor variability can arise from multiple sources and the manner in which these influence learning remains poorly understood. Here, we show that artificially increasing motor noise variability slows reinforcement learning in a similar manner to that observed in people with cerebellar damage. Importantly, we show that the detrimental effect of noise may be the attribution of reinforcement to incorrect behavior, rather than not reinforcing correct behavior. These findings indicate that variability from noise may not be accessible to reinforcement learning mechanisms, which sheds light on the mechanism of deficit following cerebellar damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Reversing allosteric communication: From detecting allosteric sites to inducing and tuning targeted allosteric response</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Ven Tee, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky&lt;/p&gt;

The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However, despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods, which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for “traditional” orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling, we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication, according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery, which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the “reverse perturbation” hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins, then, on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that, in addition to known allosteric sites, the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions, which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication, and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site’s structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/13RpS-9zFXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Evolution of chemokine receptors is driven by mutations in the sodium binding site</title>

Chemokines and their receptors (members of the GPCR super-family) are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes and diseases; thus, understanding the specificity of the chemokine receptor family could help develop new receptor specific drugs. Here, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the emergence of the chemokine receptors. Based on GPCR hierarchical classification, we analyzed nested GPCR sets with an eigen decomposition approach of the sequence covariation matrix and determined three key residues whose mutation was crucial for the emergence of the chemokine receptors and their subsequent divergence into homeostatic and inflammatory receptors. These residues are part of the allosteric sodium binding site. Their structural and functional roles were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of CXCR4 and CCR5 as prototypes of homeostatic and inflammatory chemokine receptors, respectively. This study indicates that the three mutations crucial for the evolution of the chemokine receptors dramatically altered the sodium binding mode. In CXCR4, the sodium ion is tightly bound by four protein atoms and one water molecule. In CCR5, the sodium ion is mobile within the binding pocket and moves between different sites involving from one to three protein atoms and two to five water molecules. Analysis of chemokine receptor evolution reveals that a highly constrained sodium binding site characterized most ancient receptors, and that the constraints were subsequently loosened during the divergence of this receptor family. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of the chemokine receptor functions and mechanisms of action.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHjAbuefwKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stochastic shielding and edge importance for Markov chains with timescale separation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Deena R. Schmidt, Roberto F. Galán, Peter J. Thomas&lt;/p&gt;

Nerve cells produce electrical impulses (“spikes”) through the coordinated opening and closing of ion channels. Markov processes with voltage-dependent transition rates capture the stochasticity of spike generation at the cost of complex, time-consuming simulations. Schmandt and Galán introduced a novel method, based on the stochastic shielding approximation, as a fast, accurate method for generating approximate sample paths with excellent first and second moment agreement to exact stochastic simulations. We previously analyzed the mathematical basis for the method’s remarkable accuracy, and showed that for models with a Gaussian noise approximation, the stationary variance of the occupancy at each vertex in the ion channel state graph could be written as a sum of distinct contributions from each edge in the graph. We extend this analysis to arbitrary discrete population models with first-order kinetics. The resulting decomposition allows us to rank the “importance” of each edge’s contribution to the variance of the current under stationary conditions. In most cases, transitions between open (conducting) and closed (non-conducting) states make the greatest contributions to the variance, but there are exceptions. In a 5-state model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, at low agonist concentration, a pair of “hidden” transitions (between two closed states) makes a greater contribution to the variance than any of the open-closed transitions. We exhaustively investigate this “edge importance reversal” phenomenon in simplified 3-state models, and obtain an exact formula for the contribution of each edge to the variance of the open state. Two conditions contribute to reversals: the opening rate should be faster than all other rates in the system, and the closed state leading to the opening rate should be sparsely occupied. When edge importance reversal occurs, current fluctuations are dominated by a slow noise component arising from the hidden transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o95TRa66Blg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The mechanistic details underlying the assembly of rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis and how they segregate from each other to act as individually mobile units remain largely unknown. Here, we construct a coarse-grained physical model of chromosomal DNA and condensins, a class of large protein complexes that plays key roles in these processes. We assume that condensins have two molecular activities: consecutive loop formation in DNA and inter-condensin attractions. Our simulation demonstrates that both of these activities and their balancing acts are essential for the efficient shaping and segregation of mitotic chromosomes. Our results also demonstrate that the shaping and segregation processes are strongly correlated, implying their mechanistic coupling during mitotic chromosome assembly. Our results highlight the functional importance of inter-condensin attractions in chromosome shaping and segregation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P3LOaFhEytc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Evolutionary dynamics of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006133</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathaniel Mon Père, Tom Lenaerts, Jorge M. Pacheco, David Dingli&lt;/p&gt;

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal blood disorder characterized by hemolysis and a high risk of thrombosis, that is due to a deficiency in several cell surface proteins that prevent complement activation. Its origin has been traced to a somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene within hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, to date the question of how this mutant clone expands in size to contribute significantly to hematopoiesis remains under debate. One hypothesis posits the existence of a selective advantage of PIG-A mutated cells due to an immune mediated attack on normal HSC, but the evidence supporting this hypothesis is inconclusive. An alternative (and simpler) explanation attributes clonal expansion to neutral drift, in which case selection neither favours nor inhibits expansion of PIG-A mutated HSC. Here we examine the implications of the neutral drift model by numerically evolving a Markov chain for the probabilities of all possible outcomes, and investigate the possible occurrence and evolution, within this framework, of multiple independently arising clones within the HSC pool. Predictions of the model agree well with the known incidence of the disease and average age at diagnosis. Notwithstanding the slight difference in clonal expansion rates between our results and those reported in the literature, our model results lead to a relative stability of clone size when averaging multiple cases, in accord with what has been observed in human trials. The probability of a patient harbouring a second clone in the HSC pool was found to be extremely low (~10-8). Thus our results suggest that in clinical cases of PNH where two independent clones of mutant cells are observed, only one of those is likely to have originated in the HSC pool.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xkz6PT1hV1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Increased Axonal Bouton Stability during Learning in the Mouse Model of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;-duplication syndrome is an X-linked form of syndromic autism caused by genomic duplication of the region encoding Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. Mice overexpressing &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; demonstrate social impairment, behavioral inflexibility, and altered patterns of learning and memory. Previous work showed abnormally increased stability of dendritic spines formed during motor training in the apical tuft of primary motor cortex (area M1) corticospinal neurons in the MECP2-duplication mouse model. In the current study, we measure the structural plasticity of axonal boutons in Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 during motor training. In wild-type littermate control mice we find that during rotarod training, bouton formation rate changes minimally, if at all, while bouton elimination rate more than doubles. Notably, the observed upregulation in bouton elimination with training is absent in &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;-duplication mice. This result provides further evidence of an imbalance between structural stability and plasticity in this form of syndromic autism. Furthermore, the observation that axonal bouton elimination more than doubles with motor training in wild-type animals contrasts with the increase of dendritic spine consolidation observed in corticospinal neurons at the same layer. This dissociation suggests that different area M1 microcircuits may manifest different patterns of structural synaptic plasticity during motor training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Abnormal balance between synaptic stability and plasticity is a feature of several autism spectrum disorders, often corroborated by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of dendritic spine turnover. Here we provide the first evidence that abnormally increased stability of axonal boutons, the presynaptic component of excitatory synapses, occurs during motor training in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; duplication syndrome mouse model of autism. In contrast, in normal controls, axonal bouton elimination in L5 pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 more than doubles with motor training. The fact that axonal projection boutons get eliminated, while corticospinal dendritic spines get consolidated with motor training in layer 1 of area M1, suggests that structural plasticity manifestations differ across different M1 microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study establishes a new automated live cell imaging method that was used to analyze human motor neurons in the process of dying after trophic factor withdrawal. Our aim was to provide an alternative to traditional endpoint survival assays by determining morphologic changes that predate death. This was accomplished by tracking large numbers of individual motor neurons over long periods of time. We identified features of motor neurons that distinguish between those neurons that can fully recover from the early stages of degeneration and those that are committed to death. Our research is of clear interest to neuroscientists interested in disease and improved methods for discovering effective therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Current findings suggest that accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain disrupt synaptic function in hippocampal–cortical neuronal networks leading to impairment in cognitive and affective functions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Development of new disease-modifying AD drugs are challenging due to the lack of predictive animal models and efficacy assays. In the present study we recorded neural activity in TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model with a full array of AD pathological features, including age-dependent Aβ accumulation, tauopathy, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments. Under urethane anesthesia, TgF344-AD rats showed significant age-dependent decline in brainstem-elicited hippocampal theta oscillation and decreased theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling comparing to their age-matched wild-type counterparts. In freely-behaving condition, the power of hippocampal theta oscillation and gamma power during sharp-wave ripples were significantly lower in TgF344-AD rats. Additionally, these rats showed impaired coherence in both intercortical and hippocampal–cortical network dynamics, and increased incidence of paroxysmal high-voltage spindles, which occur during awake, behaviorally quiescent state. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated impairments in sensory processing, having diminished auditory gating and 40-Hz auditory evoked steady-state response. The observed differences in neurophysiological activities in TgF344-AD rats, which mirror several abnormalities described in AD patients, may be used as promising markers to monitor disease-modifying therapies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sustained Activation of Postsynaptic 5-HT2A Receptors Gates Plasticity at Prefrontal Cortex Synapses</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in many high-level cognitive processes. It is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, which profoundly influence PFC activity. Among the 5-HT receptors abundantly expressed in PFC, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors located in dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons control neuronal excitability and mediate the psychotropic effects of psychedelic hallucinogens, but their impact on glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a 20-min exposure of mouse PFC slices to serotonin or the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces a long-lasting depression of evoked AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. DOI-elicited long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission is absent in slices from 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-deficient mice, is rescued by viral expression of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in pyramidal neurons and occludes electrically induced long-term depression. Furthermore, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation promotes phosphorylation of GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser&lt;sup&gt;880&lt;/sup&gt; and AMPA receptor internalization, indicating common mechanisms with electrically induced LTD. These findings provide one of the first examples of LTD gating under the control of a G protein-coupled receptor that might lead to imbalanced synaptic plasticity and memory impairment following a nonphysiological elevation of extracellular serotonin.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Kihm, Lars Kaestner, Christian Wagner, Stephan Quint&lt;/p&gt;

The manual evaluation, classification and counting of biological objects demands for an enormous expenditure of time and subjective human input may be a source of error. Investigating the shape of red blood cells (RBCs) in microcapillary Poiseuille flow, we overcome this drawback by introducing a convolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant shape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the so-called ‘slipper’ and ‘croissant’ shapes depending on the prevailing flow conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method, we are able to find the transition point between both ‘phases’ of stable shapes which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations. Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable results. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MySkoXXfdsE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Mammalian TRIM67 Functions in Brain Development and Behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Class I members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolutionarily appeared just prior to the advent of neuronal like cells and have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single Class I TRIM in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and the mammalian Class I TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the guidance cue netrin, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Opitz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often intellectual disability. We find that although TRIM67 is the least studied vertebrate Class I TRIM, it is the most evolutionarily conserved. Here we show that mammalian TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions during development and adulthood. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt;. While viable, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; exhibit abnormal anatomy of specific brain regions, including hypotrophy of the hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, and thinning of forebrain commissures. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice display impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function, and sensorimotor gating, whereas several other behaviors remain intact. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Pharmacological Dopamine Manipulation Does Not Alter Reward-Based Improvements in Memory Retention during a Visuomotor Adaptation Task</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Motor adaptation tasks investigate our ability to adjust motor behaviours to an ever-changing and unpredictable world. Previous work has shown that punishment-based feedback delivered during a visuomotor adaptation task enhances error-reduction, whereas reward increases memory retention. While the neural underpinnings of the influence of punishment on the adaptation phase remain unclear, reward has been hypothesized to increase retention through dopaminergic mechanisms. We directly tested this hypothesis through pharmacological manipulation of the dopaminergic system. 96 young healthy human participants were tested in a placebo-controlled double-blind between-subjects design in which they adapted to a 40-degree visuomotor rotation under reward or punishment conditions. We confirmed previous evidence that reward enhances retention, but the dopamine precursor levodopa or the dopamine antagonist haloperidol failed to influence performance. We reason that such a negative result could be due to experimental limitations or it may suggest that the effect of reward on motor memory retention is not driven by dopaminergic processes. This provides further insight regarding the role of motivational feedback in optimizing motor learning, and the basis for further decomposing the effect of reward on the subprocesses known to underlie motor adaptation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Motor adaptation tasks investigate our ability to rapidly adjust motor behaviours. However, these adjustments are transient and the learnt behavior is quickly forgotten. Previous work has found that reward-based feedback can enhance the retention of a newly acquired motor behavior and hypothesised that this effect was dependent on dopamine. Here, we confirmed that reward increases the retention of motor memories, but found that this was not influenced by drugs that altered dopamine availability in the brain. Therefore, these findings fail to confirm a role for dopamine during reward-based improvements in motor retention, and highlight possible limitations of using dopaminergic stimulation to optimize motor memory retention in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The precise regulation of fluid and energy homeostasis is essential for survival. It is well appreciated that ingestive behaviors are tightly regulated by both peripheral sensory inputs and central appetite signals. With recent neurogenetic technologies, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of basic taste qualities, the molecular and/or cellular basis of taste sensing, and the central circuits for thirst and hunger. In this review, we first highlight the functional similarities and differences between mammalian and invertebrate taste processing.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Brain Activity and Network Interactions in the Impact of Internal Emotional Distraction</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotional distraction may come from the external world and from our mind, as internal distraction. Although external emotional distraction has been extensively investigated, less is known about the mechanisms associated with the impact of internal emotional distraction on cognitive performance, and those involved in coping with such distraction. These issues were investigated using a working memory task with emotional distraction, where recollected unpleasant autobiographical memories served as internal emotional distraction. Emotion regulation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus their attention either on or away from the emotional aspects of their memories. Behaviorally, focusing away from emotion was associated with better working memory performance than focusing on the recollected emotions. Functional MRI data showed reduced response in brain regions associated with the salience network, coupled with greater recruitment of executive prefrontal and memory-related temporoparietal regions, and with increased frontoparietal connectivity, when subjects focused on nonemotional contextual details of their memories. Finally, temporal dissociations were also identified between regions involved in self-referential (showing faster responses) versus context-related processing (showing delayed responses). These findings demonstrate that focused attention is an effective regulation strategy in coping with internal distraction, and are relevant for understanding clinical conditions where coping with distressing memories is dysfunctional.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fast Compensatory Functional Network Changes Caused by Reversible Inactivation of Monkey Parietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy128</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy128/5036733?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions. However, little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and (correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal, reversible inactivations. Specifically, monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition, these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli, we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP, especially FEF. Furthermore, in areas such as FEF and V4, muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably, the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation, suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network, with FEF a likely key player. The excitationâ€“inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Overlap in Item Representations Across Episodes Impairs Context Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy137</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy137/5036074?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We frequently encounter the same item in different contexts, and when that happens, memories of earlier encounters can get reactivated. We examined how existing memories are changed as a result of such reactivation. We hypothesized that when an item’s initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. Specifically, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to subsequent source memory. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. In contrast, greater reactivation of the initial context was associated with better source memory. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., item) is represented across these episodes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Relationships Between Neuronal Oscillatory Amplitude and Dynamic Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy136</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain “activity”. However, the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular, whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics, integration between regions, or both, is unknown. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further, in resting-state data, we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled, or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here, we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that, in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability, the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations, and suggest that time–frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal D1 Dopamine-Receptor Neurons and Delta Resonance in Interval Timing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy083</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy083/5036073?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity—monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibit time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1–4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early versus late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a widespread problem for the increasing population of cancer survivors. Our understanding of the nature, causes, and prevalence of CRCI is hampered by a reliance on clinical neuropsychological methods originally designed to detect focal lesions. Future progress will require collaboration between neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology.</description>
