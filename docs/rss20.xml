                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Neuroinflammation Induced by Lipopolysaccharide Injection into the Third Ventricle Induces Behavioral Changes</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1-40/42&lt;/sub&gt; in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Photobiomodulation Promotes Neuronal Axon Regeneration After Oxidative Stress and Induces a Change in Polarization from M1 to M2 in Macrophages via Stimulation of CCL2 in Neurons: Relevance to Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; irradiation area, 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 440 s). About 100 μM H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Behçet syndrome (BS) is a vasculitis characterized by several clinical manifestations including the rare neurological involvement (neuro-BS, NBS). The aim of our pivotal study was to investigate the mutational status of several inflammation-related genes in a cohort of Italian patients with and without the neurological involvement (20 NBS vs 40 no-NBS patients). The preliminary &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and primer design were performed by NCBI Primer-Blast tool. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR. PCR amplicons were sequenced and bioinformatically analysed. Twelve tagSNPs were selected and genotyped: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187, rs17482078, and rs27044; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL10 rs1800872&lt;/em&gt; and rs1518111, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12A&lt;/em&gt; rs17810546, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12RB2&lt;/em&gt; rs924080, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STAT4&lt;/em&gt; rs7572482, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCR1&lt;/em&gt; rs7616215, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLRC4&lt;/em&gt; rs2617170, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;UBAC2&lt;/em&gt; rs3825427.&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs showed statistically significant higher frequencies in NBS group than no-NBS. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187 AA was more common in no-NBS patients (20.0% NBS vs 47.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while rs17482078 GA frequency was higher in NBS patients (55.0% NBS vs 22.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, OR: 4.21). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018 GG was more frequent in NBS group (65.0% NBS vs 40.0% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), according to a previous finding. No other statistically significant differences were found. In conclusion, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs were found associated with neurological involvement of BS. Additional and larger analyses were required to verify our preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cypermethrin Induces the Activation of Rat Primary Microglia and Expression of Inflammatory Proteins</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: L-3-n-Butylphthalide Effectively Improves the Glymphatic Clearance and Reduce Amyloid-β Deposition in Alzheimer’s Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7&quot;&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: LncRNA H19 Regulates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Apoptosis and Inflammation of BV2 Microglia Cells Through Targeting miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 Axis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Exosomal miR-146a Is Involved in Altered Expression of Alzheimer’s Risk Genes Via Suppression of TLR4 Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01750-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Circ-VPS18 Knockdown Enhances TMZ Sensitivity and Inhibits Glioma Progression by MiR-370/RUNX1 Axis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: TNFAIP1 Is Upregulated in APP/PS1 Mice and Promotes Apoptosis in SH-SY5Y Cells by Binding to RhoB</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt;-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions. We compared the expression levels &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IFN-γ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; cytokines in blood specimens of patients with migraine and those of healthy persons to identify any possible dysregulation in their expression and to propose mechanisms for this disorder. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;INF-γ&lt;/em&gt; was suggestively higher in migraine cases than in healthy individuals (posterior beta = 0.35, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.017). In addition, expression of this cytokine was lower in female subjects than in male subjects (posterior beta = −0.712, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.012). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; was also higher in cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 1.34, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.04; posterior beta = 0.849, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.036; posterior beta = 0.451, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.042, respectively). On the other hand, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt; expression was lower in migraine cases than in controls (posterior beta = −0.78, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.039). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-1B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt; were not meaningfully different between cases and controls. The current study highlights the dysregulation of cytokine-coding genes in the blood of patients with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &amp;gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Two Cases of Female Chinese Adult-Onset Krabbe Disease with One Novel Mutation and a Review of Literature</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &amp;gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &amp;gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: LncRNA Neat1 Promotes Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury by Targeting miR-29b</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01740-3</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01740-3</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Serum Progesterone and Testosterone Levels in Schizophrenia Patients at Different Stages of Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Systems Level Molecular Signatures from Glioblastoma Multiforme Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Changes in Appetite Regulation-Related Signaling Pathways in the Brain of Mice Supplemented with Non-nutritive Sweeteners</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
Extensive alterations in gene regulatory networks are a typical characteristic of Huntington's disease (HD); these include alterations in protein‐coding genes and poorly understood non‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are associated with pathology caused by mutant huntingtin. Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of ncRNAs involved in a variety of biological functions, including transcriptional regulation and post‐transcriptional modification of many targets, and likely contributed to the pathogenesis of HD. While a number of changes in lncRNAs expression have been observed in HD, little is currently known about their functions. Here, we discuss their possible mechanisms and molecular functions, with a particular focus on their roles in transcriptional regulation. These findings give us a better insight into HD pathogenesis and may provide new targets for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.</description>

backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function
with respect to the weights in the neural network model, in combination with
its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in
digital computers is intrinsically wasteful, with energy consumption becoming
prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development
of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and
integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing
systems. The learning process in these material systems, taking place, e.g., by
artificial evolution or surrogate neural network modelling, is still a
complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and
accurate homodyne gradient extraction method for performing gradient descent on
the loss function directly in the material system. We demonstrate the method in
our recently developed dopant network processing units, where we readily
realize all Boolean gates. This shows that gradient descent can in principle be
fully implemented in materio using simple electronics, opening up the way to
autonomously learning material systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be
interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment.
Although the FEP applies in theory to a wide variety of systems, there has been
almost no direct exploration of the principle in concrete systems. In this
paper, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the
simplest possible set of systems - weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear
stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general are the
requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system and (ii) how
informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We find that this
structure, known as a Markov blanket (i.e. a boundary precluding direct
coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on
its solenoidal flows, both required by the FEP, make it challenging to find
systems that fulfil the required assumptions. Suitable systems require an
absence of asymmetries in sensorimotor interactions that are highly unusual for
living systems. Moreover, we find that a core step in the argument relating the
behaviour of a system to variational inference relies on an implicit
equivalence between the dynamics of the average states with the average of the
dynamics. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems as
it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions.
These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability
of the FEP and point to potential issues in its current form. These issues make
the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear
systems studied here and suggests more development is needed before it could be
applied to the kind of complex systems which describe living and cognitive
processes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for
large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication
overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the
communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local
update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and
computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between
communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and
balancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their
impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises
significantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to
minimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update
coefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize
trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We
then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time
considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),
that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning
error. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster
than similar schemes existing in the literature.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiagent systems provide an ideal environment for the evaluation and
analysis of real-world problems using reinforcement learning algorithms. Most
traditional approaches to multiagent learning are affected by long training
periods as well as high computational complexity. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of
Augmenting Topologies) is a popular evolutionary strategy used to obtain the
best performing neural network architecture often used to tackle optimization
problems in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper utilizes the NEAT
algorithm to achieve competitive multiagent learning on a modified pong game
environment in an efficient manner. The competing agents abide by different
rules while having similar observation space parameters. The proposed algorithm
utilizes this property of the environment to define a singular
neuroevolutionary procedure that obtains the optimal policy for all the agents.
The compiled results indicate that the proposed implementation achieves ideal
behaviour in a very short training period when compared to existing multiagent
reinforcement learning models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a general technique for constructing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
capable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on
mode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE
identifies a most-specific logical formula $\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the
relational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We transform $\bot_B(e)$
into a corresponding &quot;bottom-graph&quot; that can be processed for use by standard
GNN implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of
incorporating generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term `BotGNN'
for this form of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using
real-world datasets with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs
perform significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a
recently proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into
GNNs. We also provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a
&quot;propositionalised&quot; form of the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard
ILP based on the use of most-specific clauses. Taken together, these results
point to BotGNNs as capable of combining the computational efficacy of GNNs
with the representational versatility of ILP.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a quantitative study of phase entrainment by periodic visual
stimuli in a biologically inspired neural network. The objective is to
understand the neuronal population dynamics that underlie phase entrainment.
Phase and frequency entrainment of brain oscillations by external stimuli are
used as therapeutic treatment in neurological disorders, for example in
Parkinsonian tremor. And yet, the neuronal dynamics underpinning such
entrainment is not fully understood. Rhythmic sensory stimulation is one way of
studying phase synchronisation in the brain. A recent experimental study has
shown phase entrainment of brain oscillations during steady state visually
evoked potentials (SSVEP), which are scalp electroencephalogram corresponding
to periodic rhythmic stimuli. We have simulated SSVEP-like signals
corresponding to periodic pulse input to our in silico model. We have used
phase locking values, normalised Shannon entropy and conditional probability as
synchronisation indices showing relative phase synchrony between the neuronal
populations as well with the input. The phase synchronisation disappears with
jitter in the input inter-pulse intervals. This would not have been the case if
the output signal were to be the superposition of the responses to the
different input signals. Thus, it may be inferred that the phase
synchronisation implies entrainment of the network response by the periodic
input. Overall, our study shows the plausibility of using biologically inspired
in silico models, validated with experimental works, to understand and make
testable predictions on brain entrainment as a therapeutic treatment in
specific neurological disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photonic neural networks have significant potential for high-speed neural
processing with low latency and ultralow energy consumption. However, the
on-chip implementation of a large-scale neural network is still challenging
owing to its low scalability. Herein, we propose the concept of a photonic
neural field and implement it experimentally on a silicon chip to realize
highly scalable neuro-inspired computing. In contrast to existing photonic
neural networks, the photonic neural field is a spatially continuous field that
nonlinearly responds to optical inputs, and its high spatial degrees of freedom
allow for large-scale and high-density neural processing on a millimeter-scale
chip. In this study, we use the on-chip photonic neural field as a reservoir of
information and demonstrate a high-speed chaotic time-series prediction with
low errors using a training approach similar to reservoir computing. We discuss
that the photonic neural field is potentially capable of executing more than
one peta multiply-accumulate operations per second for a single input
wavelength on a footprint as small as a few square millimeters. In addition to
processing, the photonic neural field can be used for rapidly sensing the
temporal variation of an optical phase, facilitated by its high sensitivity to
optical inputs. The merging of optical processing with optical sensing paves
the way for an end-to-end data-driven optical sensing scheme.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past three decades, a large number of metaheuristics have been
proposed and shown high performance in solving complex optimization problems.
While most variation operators in existing metaheuristics are empirically
designed, this paper aims to design new operators automatically, which are
expected to be search space independent and thus exhibit robust performance on
different problems. For this purpose, this work first investigates the
influence of translation invariance, scale invariance, and rotation invariance
on the search behavior and performance of some representative operators. Then,
we deduce the generic form of translation, scale, and rotation invariant
operators. Afterwards, a principled approach is proposed for the automated
design of operators, which searches for high-performance operators based on the
deduced generic form. The experimental results demonstrate that the operators
generated by the proposed approach outperform state-of-the-art ones on a
variety of problems with complex landscapes and up to 1000 decision variables.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the present work, we introduce a general class of mean-field interacting
nonlinear Hawkes processes modelling the reciprocal interactions between two
neuronal populations, one excitatory and one inhibitory. The model incorporates
two features: inhibition, which acts as a multiplicative factor onto the
intensity of the excitatory population and additive retroaction from the
excitatory neurons onto the inhibitory ones. We give first a detailed analysis
of the well-posedness of this interacting system as well as its dynamics in
large population. The second aim of the paper is to give a rigorous analysis of
the longtime behavior of the mean-field limit process. We provide also
numerical evidence that inhibition and retroaction may be responsible for the
emergence of limit cycles in such system.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is the wide-network limit of a kernel defined
using neural networks at initialization, whose embedding is the gradient of the
output of the network with respect to its parameters. We study the &quot;after
kernel&quot;, which is defined using the same embedding, except after training, for
neural networks with standard architectures, on binary classification problems
extracted from MNIST and CIFAR-10, trained using SGD in a standard way. Lyu and
Li described a sense in which neural networks, under certain conditions, are
equivalent to SVM with the after kernel. Our experiments are consistent with
this proposition under natural conditions. For networks with an architecure
similar to VGG, the after kernel is more &quot;global&quot;, in the sense that it is less
invariant to transformations of input images that disrupt the global structure
of the image while leaving the local statistics largely intact. For fully
connected networks, the after kernel is less global in this sense. The after
kernel tends to be more invariant to small shifts, rotations and zooms; data
augmentation does not improve these invariances. The (finite approximation to
the) conjugate kernel, obtained using the last layer of hidden nodes,
sometimes, but not always, provides a good approximation to the NTK and the
after kernel.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10577</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning to count is an important example of the broader human capacity for
systematic generalization, and the development of counting is often
characterized by an inflection point when children rapidly acquire proficiency
with the procedures that support this ability. We aimed to model this process
by training a reinforcement learning agent to select N items from a binary
vector when instructed (known as the give-$N$ task). We found that a
memory-augmented modular network architecture based on the recently proposed
Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN) exhibited an inflection during learning
that resembled human development. This model was also capable of systematic
extrapolation outside the range of its training set - for example, trained only
to select between 1 and 10 items, it could succeed at selecting 11 to 15 items
as long as it could make use of an arbitrary count sequence of at least that
length. The close parallels to child development and the capacity for
extrapolation suggest that our model could shed light on the emergence of
systematicity in humans.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain signals could be used to control devices to assist individuals with
disabilities. Signals such as electroencephalograms are complicated and hard to
interpret. A set of signals are collected and should be classified to identify
the intention of the subject. Different approaches have tried to reduce the
number of channels before sending them to a classifier. We are proposing a deep
learning-based method for selecting an informative subset of channels that
produce high classification accuracy. The proposed network could be trained for
an individual subject for the selection of an appropriate set of channels.
Reduction of the number of channels could reduce the complexity of
brain-computer-interface devices. Our method could find a subset of channels.
The accuracy of our approach is comparable with a model trained on all
channels. Hence, our model's temporal and power costs are low, while its
accuracy is kept high.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: GPR68 Contributes to Persistent Acidosis-Induced Activation of AGC Kinases and Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Organotypic Hippocampal Slices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.692217</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Persistent acidosis occurs in ischemia and multiple neurological diseases. In previous studies, acidic stimulation leads to rapid increase in intracellular calcium in neurons. However, it remains largely unclear how a prolonged acidosis alters neuronal signaling. In our previous study, we found that GPR68-mediated PKC activities are protective against acidosis-induced injury in cortical slices. Here, we first asked whether the same principle holds true in organotypic hippocampal slices. Our data showed that 1-h pH 6 induced PKC phosphorylation in a GPR68-dependent manner. Go6983, a PKC inhibitor worsened acidosis-induced neuronal injury in wild type (WT) but had no effect in GPR68&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; slices. Next, to gain greater insights into acid signaling in brain tissue, we treated organotypic hippocampal slices with pH 6 for 1-h and performed a kinome profiling analysis by Western blot. Acidosis had little effect on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) or casein kinase 2 activity, two members of the CMGC family, or Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM and RAD3-related (ATR) activity, but reduced the phosphorylation of MAPK/CDK substrates. In contrast, acidosis induced the activation of CaMKIIα, PKA, and Akt. Besides these serine/threonine kinases, acidosis also induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Since GPR68 is widely expressed in brain neurons, we asked whether GPR68 contributes to acidosis-induced signaling. Deleting GPR68 had no effect on acidosis-induced CaMKII phosphorylation, attenuated that of phospho-Akt and phospho-PKA substrates, while abolishing acidosis-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that prolonged acidosis activates a network of signaling cascades, mediated by AGC kinases, CaMKII, and tyrosine kinases. GPR68 is the primary mediator for acidosis-induced activation of PKC and tyrosine phosphorylation, while both GPR68-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to the activation of PKA and Akt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Harmonized Segmentation of Neonatal Brain MRI</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning based medical image segmentation has shown great potential in becoming a key part of the clinical analysis pipeline. However, many of these models rely on the assumption that the train and test data come from the same distribution. This means that such methods cannot guarantee high quality predictions when the source and target domains are dissimilar due to different acquisition protocols, or biases in patient cohorts. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have shown great potential in alleviating this problem by minimizing the shift between the source and target distributions, without requiring the use of labeled data in the target domain. In this work, we aim to predict tissue segmentation maps on T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of an unseen preterm-born neonatal population, which has both different acquisition parameters and population bias when compared to our training data. We achieve this by investigating two unsupervised domain adaptation techniques with the objective of finding the best solution for our problem. We compare the two methods with a baseline fully-supervised segmentation network and report our results in terms of Dice scores obtained on our source test dataset. Moreover, we analyse tissue volumes and cortical thickness measures of the harmonized data on a subset of the population matched for gestational age at birth and postmenstrual age at scan. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the harmonized cortical gray matter maps with an analysis comparing term and preterm-born neonates and a proof-of-principle investigation of the association between cortical thickness and a language outcome measure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. In recent years, it has been proven that the kynurenine system plays a significant role in the development of several nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Kynurenine pathway metabolites have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects. Moreover, the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway play an important role in immunomodulation processes, among others, as well as interacting with neuronal energy balance and various redox reactions. Dysregulation of many of the enzymatic steps in kynurenine pathway and upregulated levels of these metabolites locally in the central nervous system, contribute to the progression of multiple sclerosis pathology. This process can initiate a pathogenic cascade, including microglia activation, glutamate excitotoxicity, chronic oxidative stress or accumulated mitochondrial damage in the axons, that finally disrupt the homeostasis of neurons, leads to destabilization of neuronal cell cytoskeleton, contributes to neuro-axonal damage and neurodegeneration. Neurofilaments are good biomarkers of the neuro-axonal damage and their level reliably indicates the severity of multiple sclerosis and the treatment response. There is increasing evidence that connections exist between the molecules generated in the kynurenine metabolic pathway and the change in neurofilament concentrations. Thus the alterations in the kynurenine pathway may be an important biomarker of the course of multiple sclerosis. In our present review, we report the possible relationship and connection between neurofilaments and the kynurenine system in multiple sclerosis based on the available evidences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Insight Into Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 31 (SCA31) From Drosophila Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.648133</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.648133</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Its genetic cause is a 2.5- to 3.8-kb-long complex pentanucleotide repeat insertion containing (TGGAA)n, (TAGAA)n, (TAAAA)n, and (TAAAATAGAA)n located in an intron shared by two different genes: brain expressed associated with NEDD4-1 (BEAN1) and thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). Among these repeat sequences, (TGGAA)n repeat was the only sequence segregating with SCA31, which strongly suggests its pathogenicity. In SCA31 patient brains, the mutant BEAN1 transcript containing expanded UGGAA repeats (UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;) was found to form abnormal RNA structures called RNA foci in cerebellar Purkinje cell nuclei. In addition, the deposition of pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, poly(Trp-Asn-Gly-Met-Glu), translated from UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA, was detected in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells. To uncover the pathogenesis of UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in SCA31, we generated Drosophila models of SCA31 expressing UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA. The toxicity of UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; depended on its length and expression level, which was accompanied by the accumulation of RNA foci and translation of repeat-associated PPR proteins in Drosophila, consistent with the observation in SCA31 patient brains. We also revealed that TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2B1, motor neuron disease–linked RNA-binding proteins bound to UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA, act as RNA chaperones to regulate the formation of RNA foci and repeat-associated translation. Further research on the role of RNA-binding proteins as RNA chaperones may also provide a novel therapeutic strategy for other microsatellite repeat expansion diseases besides SCA31.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Differential Effects of the Six Human TAU Isoforms: Somatic Retention of 2N-TAU and Increased Microtubule Number Induced by 4R-TAU</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643115</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643115</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the adult human brain, six isoforms of the microtubule-associated protein TAU are expressed, which result from alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of the MAPT gene. These isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal inserts (0N, 1N, 2N) and C-terminal repeat domains (3R or 4R) and are differentially expressed depending on the brain region and developmental stage. Although all TAU isoforms can aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles, some tauopathies, such as Pick’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, are characterized by the accumulation of specific TAU isoforms. The influence of the individual TAU isoforms in a cellular context, however, is understudied. In this report, we investigated the subcellular localization of the human-specific TAU isoforms in primary mouse neurons and analyzed TAU isoform-specific effects on cell area and microtubule dynamics in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that 2N-TAU isoforms are particularly retained from axonal sorting and that axonal enrichment is independent of the number of repeat domains, but that the additional repeat domain of 4R-TAU isoforms results in a general reduction of cell size and an increase of microtubule counts in cells expressing these specific isoforms. Our study points out that individual TAU isoforms may influence microtubule dynamics differentially both by different sorting patterns and by direct effects on microtubule dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Blocking Cross-Species Secondary Binding When Performing Double Immunostaining With Mouse and Rat Primary Antibodies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.579859</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.579859</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Immunostaining is a powerful technique and widely used to identify molecules in tissues and cells, although critical steps are necessary to block cross-reaction. Here we focused on an overlooked cross immunoreactivity issue where a secondary antibody (secondary) cross-reacts with a primary antibody (primary) from a different species. We first confirmed the previously reported cross-species binding of goat anti-mouse secondary to rat primary. This was accomplished by staining with a rat primary against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and visualizing with goat (or donkey) anti-mouse secondary. We then further revealed the converse cross-species binding by staining with a mouse primary against neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) and visualizing with anti-rat secondaries. We speculate that mouse and rat primaries share antigenicity, enabling either secondary to recognize either primary. To block this cross-species binding in double staining experiments, we compared three protocols using mouse anti-NeuN and rat anti-GFAP, two primaries whose antigens have non-overlapping distributions in brain tissues. Simultaneous staining resulted in cross-species astrocytic staining (anti-mouse secondary to rat anti-GFAP primary) but no cross-species neuronal staining (anti-rat secondary to mouse anti-NeuN primary). Cross-species astrocytic staining was missing after sequential same-species staining with mouse anti-NeuN primary, followed by rat anti-GFAP. However, cross-species astrocytic staining could not be diminished after sequential same-species staining with rat anti-GFAP primary, followed by mouse anti-NeuN. We thus hypothesize that a competition exists between anti-mouse and anti-rat secondaries in their binding to both primaries. Single staining for NeuN or GFAP visualized with dual secondaries at different dilution ratio supported this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that analysis of bio-signals such as rest state electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data can provide more reliable evaluation of children autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than traditional methods of behavior measurement relying on scales do. However, the effectiveness of the new approaches still lags behind the increasing requirement in clinical or educational practices as the “bio-marker” information carried by the bio-signal of a single-modality is likely insufficient or distorted. This study proposes an approach to joint analysis of EEG and eye-tracking for children ASD evaluation. The approach focuses on deep fusion of the features in two modalities as no explicit correlations between the original bio-signals are available, which also limits the performance of existing methods along this direction. First, the synchronization measures, information entropy, and time-frequency features of the multi-channel EEG are derived. Then a random forest applies to the eye-tracking recordings of the same subjects to single out the most significant features. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model then naturally fuses the two group of features to differentiate the children with ASD from the typically developed (TD) subjects. Experiments have been carried out on the two types of the bio-signals collected from 42 children (21 ASD and 21 TD subjects, 3–6 years old). The results indicate that (1) the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy of 95% in ASD detection, and (2) strong correlations exist between the two bio-signals collected even asynchronously, in particular the EEG synchronization against the face related/joint attentions in terms of covariance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Networks Underlying Strategy Execution and Feedback Processing in an Efficient Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Neurofeedback Training Performed in a Parallel or a Serial Paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback (NF) is a complex learning scenario, as the task consists of trying out mental strategies while processing a feedback signal that signifies activation in the brain area to be self-regulated and acts as a potential reward signal. In an attempt to dissect these subcomponents, we obtained whole-brain networks associated with efficient self-regulation in two paradigms: parallel, where the task was performed concurrently, combining feedback with strategy execution; and serial, where the task was performed consecutively, separating feedback processing from strategy execution. Twenty participants attempted to control their anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) NF in 18 sessions over 2 weeks, using cognitive and emotional mental strategies. We analyzed whole-brain fMRI activations in the NF training runs with the largest aMCC activation for the serial and parallel paradigms. The equal length of the strategy execution and the feedback processing periods in the serial paradigm allows a description of the two task subcomponents with equal power. The resulting activation maps were spatially correlated with functionally annotated intrinsic connectivity brain maps (BMs). Brain activation in the parallel condition correlates with the basal ganglia (BG) network, the cingulo-opercular network (CON), and the frontoparietal control network (FPCN); brain activation in the serial strategy execution condition with the default mode network (DMN), the FPCN, and the visual processing network; while brain activation in the serial feedback processing condition predominantly with the CON, the DMN, and the FPCN. Additional comparisons indicate that BG activation is characteristic to the parallel paradigm, while supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) activations are characteristic to the serial paradigm. The multifaceted view of the subcomponents allows describing the cognitive processes associated with strategy execution and feedback processing independently in the serial feedback task and as combined processes in the multitasking scenario of the conventional parallel feedback task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical and Subcortical Circuits for Cross-Modal Plasticity Induced by Loss of Vision</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical areas are highly interconnected both via cortical and subcortical pathways, and primary sensory cortices are not isolated from this general structure. In primary sensory cortical areas, these pre-existing functional connections serve to provide contextual information for sensory processing and can mediate adaptation when a sensory modality is lost. Cross-modal plasticity in broad terms refers to widespread plasticity across the brain in response to losing a sensory modality, and largely involves two distinct changes: cross-modal recruitment and compensatory plasticity. The former involves recruitment of the deprived sensory area, which includes the deprived primary sensory cortex, for processing the remaining senses. Compensatory plasticity refers to plasticity in the remaining sensory areas, including the spared primary sensory cortices, to enhance the processing of its own sensory inputs. Here, we will summarize potential cellular plasticity mechanisms involved in cross-modal recruitment and compensatory plasticity, and review cortical and subcortical circuits to the primary sensory cortices which can mediate cross-modal plasticity upon loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Improving NKCC1 Function Increases the Excitability of DRG Neurons Exacerbating Pain Induced After TRPV1 Activation of Primary Sensory Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.665596</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.665596</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background Our aim was to investigate the effects of the protein expression and the function of sodium, potassium, and chloride co-transporter (NKCC1) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1) in capsaicin-induced acute inflammatory pain and the possible mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, capsaicin, and inhibitor groups. The expression and distribution of TRPV1 and NKCC1 in rat DRG were observed by immunofluorescence. Thermal radiation and acetone test were used to detect the pain threshold of heat and cold noxious stimulation in each group. The expressions of NKCC1 mRNA, NKCC1 protein, and p-NKCC1 in the DRG were detected by PCR and western blotting (WB). Patch clamp and chloride fluorescent probe were used to observe the changes of GABA activation current and intracellular chloride concentration. After intrathecal injection of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GF109203X) or MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (U0126), the behavioral changes and the expression of NKCC1 and p-ERK protein in L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; DRG were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: TRPV1 and NKCC1 were co-expressed in the DRG. Compared with the control group, the immunofluorescence intensity of NKCC1 and p-NKCC1 in the capsaicin group was significantly higher, and the expression of NKCC1 in the nuclear membrane was significantly higher than that in the control group. The expression of NKCC1 mRNA and protein of NKCC1 and p-NKCC1 in the capsaicin group were higher than those in the control group. After capsaicin injection, GF109203X inhibited the protein expression of NKCC1 and p-ERK, while U0126 inhibited the protein expression of NKCC1. In the capsaicin group, paw withdrawal thermal latency (WTL) was decreased, while cold withdrawal latency (CWL) was prolonged. Bumetanide, GF109203X, or U0126 could reverse the effect. GABA activation current significantly increased in the DRG cells of the capsaicin group, which could be reversed by bumetanide. The concentration of chloride in the DRG cells of the capsaicin group increased, but decreased after bumetanide, GF109203X, and U0126 were administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion Activation of TRPV1 by exogenous agonists can increase the expression and function of NKCC1 protein in DRG, which is mediated by activation of PKC/p-ERK signaling pathway. These results suggest that DRG NKCC1 may participate in the inflammatory pain induced by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: MiR-30c-5p/ATG5 Axis Regulates the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.644507</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serum miR-30c-5p correlates with Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet its role has not been illustrated. This research analyzed the function of miR-30c-5p in PD. The behavioral evaluation was performed on MPTP-treated PD mice transfected with miR-30c-5p agomiR, antagomiR, siATG5, or 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor). Oxidative stress-related factors, miR-30c-5p, and apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins in brain tissues or cells were determined by molecular experiments. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine metabolic markers were detected using immunofluorescence and Diode Array Detector (DAD), respectively. Effects of miR-30c-5p and its target gene Autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5 protein (ATG5) on MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells were determined through a series of molecular experiments. MiR-30c-5p was upregulated but ATG5 was downregulated in PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR attenuated the decrease of ATG5 in PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR partly alleviated the behavioral symptoms and inhibited the increases of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and SOD in PD mice. The levels of Bcl-2, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), TH, and LC3 II were downregulated in PD mice, while Bax, cleaved caspase-3, P62, and LC3 I were upregulated. However, miR-30c-5p antagomiR partly reversed the levels of these factors in PD mice. 3-MA could block the effects of miR-30c-5p antagomiR on PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR attenuated apoptosis and induced autophagy in brain tissues of MPTP-treated mice by targeting ATG5. In vitro assay results also showed that silence of ATG5 reduced the protective effect of miR-30c-5p downregulation on the cells. MiR-30c-5p regulates the progression of Parkinson’s disease through attenuating ATG5-inhibited apoptosis and -induced autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Overexpressed NaV1.7 Channels Confer Hyperexcitability to in vitro Trigeminal Sensory Neurons of CaV2.1 Mutant Hemiplegic Migraine Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640709</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trigeminal sensory neurons of transgenic knock-in (KI) mice expressing the R192Q missense mutation in the α1A subunit of neuronal voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, which leads to familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) in patients, exhibit a hyperexcitability phenotype. Here, we show that the expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels, linked to pain states, is upregulated in KI primary cultures of trigeminal ganglia (TG), as shown by increased expression of its α1 subunit. In the majority of TG neurons, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels are co-expressed with ATP-gated P2X3 receptors (P2X3R), which are important nociceptive sensors. Reversing the trigeminal phenotype with selective Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channel inhibitor ω-agatoxin IVA inhibited Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 overexpression. Functionally, KI neurons revealed a TTX-sensitive inward current of larger amplitude that was partially inhibited by selective Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 blocker Tp1a. Under current-clamp condition, Tp1a raised the spike threshold of both wild-type (WT) and KI neurons with decreased firing rate in KI cells. Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 activator OD1 accelerated firing in WT and KI neurons, a phenomenon blocked by Tp1a. Enhanced expression and function of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels in KI TG neurons resulted in higher excitability and facilitated nociceptive signaling. Co-expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels and P2X3Rs in TGs may explain how hypersensitivity to local stimuli can be relevant to migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Carotid Atherosclerotic Calcification Characteristics Relate to Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682908</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682908</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Together with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), large vessel atherosclerosis is considered to be an equally important risk factor in the progression of vascular cognitive impairment. This article aims to investigate whether carotid atherosclerotic calcification is associated with the increased risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 128 patients (mean age: 62.1 ± 12.2 years, 37 women) suffering from ischemic stroke underwent brain/neck computer tomography angiography examination. The presence and characteristic of carotid calcification (size, number and location) were analyzed on computer tomography angiography. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) was assessed using Fazekas scales. PSCI was diagnosed based on a battery of neuropsychological assessments implemented 6−12 months after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among 128 patients, 26 developed post-stroke dementia and 96 had carotid calcification. Logistic regression found carotid calcification (odds ratio [OR] = 7.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–47.69) and carotid artery stenosis (OR = 6.42, 95% CI: 1.03–40.15) both significantly increased the risk for post-stroke dementia. Moreover, multiple, thick/mixed, and surface calcifications exhibited an increasing trend in PSCI (P&lt;sub&gt;trend&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.004, 0.016, 0.045, respectively). The prediction model for post-stroke dementia including carotid calcification (area under curve = 0.67), WMH (area under curve = 0.67) and other covariates yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82–0.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the quantity and location of carotid calcifications were independent indicators for PSCI. The significant role of large vessel atherosclerosis in PSCI should be concerned in future study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cornel Iridoid Glycoside Protects Against STAT1-Dependent Synapse and Memory Deficits by Increasing N-Methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Expression in a Tau Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;P301S transgenic mice are an animal model of tauopathy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), exhibiting tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction. Cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) is an active ingredient extracted from Cornus officinalis, a traditional Chinese herb. In the present study, the purpose was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CIG on tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction using P301S transgenic mice. The results showed that intragastric administration of CIG for 3.5 months improved cognitive impairments and the survival rate of P301S mice. Electrophysiological recordings and transmission electron microscopy study showed that CIG improved synaptic plasticity and increased the ultrastructure and number of synapse. Moreover, CIG increased the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1. We inferred that the major mechanism of CIG involving in the regulation of synaptic dysfunctions was inhibiting the activation of Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway and alleviating STAT1-induced suppression of NMDAR expressions. Based on our findings, we thought CIG might be a promising candidate for the therapy of tauopathy such as AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Odor Recognition Memory in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625171</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625171</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory impairment is a central non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have demonstrated that olfactory dysfunction is associated with mental illness and impaired cognition. The frequently investigated olfactory functions are odor detection, discrimination, and identification. However, few studies have focused on odor recognition memory (ORM). ORM tasks involves episodic memory which therefore can facilitate the detection of dementia among patients with PD and consequently adjust their treatment. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing research on ORM in PD. Databases and reference lists were used for data collection. Studies were included in the review if they met the eligibility criteria derived from the PICOS-framework. Quality evaluation of the studies was based on the STROBE-statement. Six studies with small samples were included in the analysis which demonstrated the scarce research on the subject. The studies targeting ORM were heterogenous and involved two main tasks: odor recognition and odor matching. The synthesis of the data demonstrated that PD patients performed significantly lower than controls on both tasks, especially on odor matching task. Only the odor recognition task exhibited a difference between patients with PD vs. Alzheimer's disease (AD). PD patients performed significantly better than AD patients. The findings based on the available limited data support the notion that odor recognition task can be of importance in identifying Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). To investigate this hypothesis, future research needs to include larger samples of PD, PDD and AD patients executing the same odor recognition task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Itch is an unpleasant sensation that elicits robust scratching and aversive experience. However, the identity of the cells and neural circuits that organize this information remains elusive. Here we show the necessity and sufficiency of chloroquine-activated neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) for both itch sensation and associated aversion. Further, we show that chloroquine-activated CeA neurons play important roles in itch-related comorbidities, including anxiety-like behaviors, but not in some aversive and appetitive behaviors previously ascribed to CeA neurons. RNA-sequencing of chloroquine-activated CeA neurons identified several differentially expressed genes as well as potential key signaling pathways in regulating pruritis. Finally, viral tracing experiments demonstrate that these neurons send projections to the ventral periaqueductal gray that are critical in modulation of itch. These findings reveal a cellular and circuit signature of CeA neurons orchestrating behavioral and affective responses to pruritus in mice.</description>

	<description>T cells use their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to discriminate between lower-affinity self and higher-affinity non-self pMHC antigens. Although the discriminatory power of the TCR is widely believed to be near-perfect, technical difficulties have hampered efforts to precisely quantify it. Here, we describe a method for measuring very low TCR/pMHC affinities, and use it to measure the discriminatory power of the TCR, and the factors affecting it. We find that TCR discrimination, although enhanced compared with conventional cell-surface receptors, is imperfect: primary human T cells can respond to pMHC with affinities as low as K&lt;sub&gt;D &lt;/sub&gt;~1 mM. The kinetic proofreading mechanism fit our data, providing the first estimates of both the time delay (2.8 s) and number of biochemical steps (2.67) that are consistent with the extraordinary sensitivity of antigen recognition. Our findings explain why self pMHC frequently induce autoimmune diseases and anti-tumour responses, and suggest ways to modify TCR discrimination.</description>

	<title>eLife: Post-translational flavinylation is associated with diverse extracytosolic redox functionalities throughout bacterial life</title>

	<description>Disparate redox activities that take place beyond the bounds of the prokaryotic cell cytosol must connect to membrane or cytosolic electron pools. Proteins post-translationally flavinylated by the enzyme ApbE mediate electron transfer in several characterized extracytosolic redox systems but the breadth of functions of this modification remains unknown. Here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of 31,910 prokaryotic genomes that provides evidence of extracytosolic ApbEs within ~50% of bacteria and the involvement of flavinylation in numerous uncharacterized biochemical processes. By mining flavinylation-associated gene clusters, we identify five protein classes responsible for transmembrane electron transfer and two domains of unknown function (DUF2271 and DUF3570) that are flavinylated by ApbE. We observe flavinylation/iron transporter gene colocalization patterns that implicate functions in iron reduction and assimilation. We find associations with characterized and uncharacterized respiratory oxidoreductases that highlight roles of flavinylation in respiratory electron transport chains. Finally, we identify interspecies gene cluster variability consistent with flavinylation/cytochrome functional redundancies and discover a class of 'multi-flavinylated proteins' that may resemble multiheme cytochromes in facilitating longer distance electron transfer. These findings provide key mechanistic insight into an important facet of bacterial physiology and establish flavinylation as a functionally diverse mediator of extracytosolic electron transfer.</description>

	<description>The &lt;i&gt;hemibrain&lt;/i&gt; connectome provides large scale connectivity and morphology information for the majority of the central brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Using this data set, we provide a complete description of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; olfactory system, covering all first, second and lateral horn-associated third-order neurons. We develop a generally applicable strategy to extract information flow and layered organisation from connectome graphs, mapping olfactory input to descending interneurons. This identifies a range of motifs including highly lateralised circuits in the antennal lobe and patterns of convergence downstream of the mushroom body and lateral horn. Leveraging a second data set we provide a first quantitative assessment of inter- versus intra-individual stereotypy. Comparing neurons across two brains (three hemispheres) reveals striking similarity in neuronal morphology across brains. Connectivity correlates with morphology and neurons of the same morphological type show similar connection variability within the same brain as across two brains.</description>

	<title>eLife: TRPM channels mediate learned pathogen avoidance following intestinal distention</title>

	<description>Upon exposure to harmful microorganisms, hosts engage in protective molecular and behavioral immune responses, both of which are ultimately regulated by the nervous system. Using the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we show that ingestion of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis &lt;/i&gt;leads to a fast pathogen avoidance behavior that results in aversive learning. We have identified multiple sensory mechanisms involved in the regulation of avoidance of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis. &lt;/i&gt;The G-protein coupled receptor NPR-1-dependent oxygen-sensing pathway opposes this avoidance behavior, while an ASE neuron-dependent pathway and an AWB and AWC neuron-dependent pathway are directly required for avoidance. Colonization of the anterior part of the intestine by &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis &lt;/i&gt;leads to AWB and AWC mediated olfactory aversive learning. Finally, two transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channels, GON-2 and GTL-2, mediate this newly described rapid pathogen avoidance. These results suggest a mechanism by which TRPM channels may sense the intestinal distension caused by bacterial colonization to elicit pathogen avoidance and aversive learning by detecting changes in host physiology.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mechanical heterogeneity along single cell-cell junctions is driven by lateral clustering of cadherins during vertebrate axis elongation</title>

	<description>Morphogenesis is governed by the interplay of molecular signals and mechanical forces across multiple length scales. The last decade has seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the dynamics of protein localization and turnover at sub-cellular length scales, and at the other end of the spectrum, of mechanics at tissue-level length scales. Integrating the two remains a challenge, however, because we lack a detailed understanding of the subcellular patterns of mechanical properties of cells within tissues. Here, in the context of the elongating body axis of &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos, we combine tools from cell biology and physics to demonstrate that individual cell-cell junctions display finely-patterned local mechanical heterogeneity along their length. We show that such local mechanical patterning is essential for the cell movements of convergent extension and is imparted by locally patterned clustering of a classical cadherin. Finally, the patterning of cadherins and thus local mechanics along cell-cell junctions are controlled by Planar Cell Polarity signaling, a key genetic module for CE that is mutated in diverse human birth defects.</description>

	<title>eLife: Detecting adaptive introgression in human evolution using convolutional neural networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64669</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64669</link>
	<description>Studies in a variety of species have shown evidence for positively selected variants introduced into a population via introgression from another, distantly related population - a process known as adaptive introgression. However, there are few explicit frameworks for jointly modelling introgression and positive selection, in order to detect these variants using genomic sequence data. Here, we develop an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs do not require the specification of an analytical model of allele frequency dynamics, and have outperformed alternative methods for classification and parameter estimation tasks in various areas of population genetics. Thus, they are potentially well suited to the identification of adaptive introgression. Using simulations, we trained CNNs on genotype matrices derived from genomes sampled from the donor population, the recipient population and a related non-introgressed population, in order to distinguish regions of the genome evolving under adaptive introgression from those evolving neutrally or experiencing selective sweeps. Our CNN architecture exhibits 95% accuracy on simulated data, even when the genomes are unphased, and accuracy decreases only moderately in the presence of heterosis. As a proof of concept, we applied our trained CNNs to human genomic datasets - both phased and unphased - to detect candidates for adaptive introgression that shaped our evolutionary history.</description>

	<title>eLife: Optogenetic strategies for high-efficiency all-optical interrogation using blue light-sensitive opsins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63359</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63359</link>
	<description>All-optical methods for imaging and manipulating brain networks with high spatial resolution are fundamental to study how neuronal ensembles drive behavior. Stimulation of neuronal ensembles using holographic techniques requires high-sensitivity actuators to avoid photodamage and heating. Moreover, two-photon-excitable opsins should be insensitive to light at wavelengths used for imaging. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel soma-targeted variant of the large-conductance blue light-sensitive opsin CoChR (stCoChR). In the mouse cortex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we combined holographic two-photon stimulation of stCoChR with an amplified laser tuned at the opsin absorption peak and imaging of the red-shifted indicator jRCaMP1a. Compared to previously characterized blue light-sensitive soma-targeted opsins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, stCoChR allowed neuronal stimulation with more than 10-fold lower average power and no spectral crosstalk. The combination of stCoChR, tuned amplified laser stimulation, and red-shifted functional indicators promises to be a powerful tool for large-scale interrogation of neural networks in the intact brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Molecular Logic Organizing the Functional Compartmentalization of Reciprocal Synapses</title>

	<description>Reciprocal synapses are formed by neighboring dendritic processes that create the smallest possible neural circuit. Reciprocal synapses are widespread in brain and essential for information processing, but constitute a conceptual conundrum: How are adjacent pre- and post synaptic specializations maintained as separate functional units? Here, we reveal an organizational principle for reciprocal synapses, using dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells in the mouse olfactory bulb as a paradigm. We show that mitral cells secrete cerebellin-1 to block the cis-interaction of mitral cell neurexins with neuroligins, thereby enabling their separate trans-interactions. Ablating either cerebellin-1 or neuroligins in mitral cells severely impaired granule cell[-&amp;gt;]mitral cell synapses, as did overexpression of postsynaptic neurexins that form ciscomplexes with neuroligins, but not of mutant neurexins unable to bind to neuroligins. Our data uncover a cis/trans-protein interaction network as a general design principle that organizes reciprocal dendro dendritic synapses by compartmentalizing neurexin-based trans-synaptic protein complexes.</description>

Sequence-based residue contact prediction plays a crucial role in protein structure reconstruction. In recent years, the combination of evolutionary coupling analysis (ECA) and deep learning (DL) techniques has made tremendous progress for residue contact prediction, thus a comprehensive assessment of current methods based on a large-scale benchmark data set is very needed. In this study, we evaluate 18 contact predictors on 610 non-redundant proteins and 32 CASP13 targets according to a wide range of perspectives. The results show that different methods have different application scenarios: (1) DL methods based on multi-categories of inputs and large training sets are the best choices for low-contact-density proteins such as the intrinsically disordered ones and proteins with shallow multi-sequence alignments (MSAs). (2) With at least 5L (L is sequence length) effective sequences in the MSA, all the methods show the best performance, and methods that rely only on MSA as input can reach comparable achievements as methods that adopt multi-source inputs. (3) For top L/5 and L/2 predictions, DL methods can predict more hydrophobic interactions while ECA methods predict more salt bridges and disulfide bonds. (4) ECA methods can detect more secondary structure interactions, while DL methods can accurately excavate more contact patterns and prune isolated false positives. In general, multi-input DL methods with large training sets dominate current approaches with the best overall performance. Despite the great success of current DL methods must be stated the fact that there is still much room left for further improvement: (1) With shallow MSAs, the performance will be greatly affected. (2) Current methods show lower precisions for inter-domain compared with intra-domain contact predictions, as well as very high imbalances in precisions for intra-domains. (3) Strong prediction similarities between DL methods indicating more feature types and diversified models need to be developed. (4) The runtime of most methods can be further optimized.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/siLP2VRCLOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Synaptic clustering on neuronal dendrites has been hypothesized to play an important role in implementing pattern recognition. Neighboring synapses on a dendritic branch can interact in a synergistic, cooperative manner via nonlinear voltage-dependent mechanisms, such as NMDA receptors. Inspired by the NMDA receptor, the single-branch clusteron learning algorithm takes advantage of location-dependent multiplicative nonlinearities to solve classification tasks by randomly shuffling the locations of “under-performing” synapses on a model dendrite during learning (“structural plasticity”), eventually resulting in synapses with correlated activity being placed next to each other on the dendrite. We propose an alternative model, the gradient clusteron, or G-clusteron, which uses an analytically-derived gradient descent rule where synapses are &quot;attracted to&quot; or &quot;repelled from&quot; each other in an input- and location-dependent manner. We demonstrate the classification ability of this algorithm by testing it on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and show that, when using a softmax activation function, the accuracy of the G-clusteron on the all-versus-all MNIST task (~85%) approaches that of logistic regression (~93%). In addition to the location update rule, we also derive a learning rule for the synaptic weights of the G-clusteron (“functional plasticity”) and show that a G-clusteron that utilizes the weight update rule can achieve ~89% accuracy on the MNIST task. We also show that a G-clusteron with both the weight and location update rules can learn to solve the XOR problem from arbitrary initial conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KRXrTXsT_Mo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

An interesting problem for the human saccadic eye-movement system is how to deal with the degrees-of-freedom problem: the six extra-ocular muscles provide three rotational degrees of freedom, while only two are needed to point gaze at any direction. Measurements show that 3D eye orientations during head-fixed saccades in far-viewing conditions lie in Listing’s plane (LP), in which the eye’s cyclotorsion is zero (Listing’s law, LL). Moreover, while saccades are executed as single-axis rotations around a stable eye-angular velocity axis, they follow straight trajectories in LP. Another distinctive saccade property is their nonlinear main-sequence dynamics: the affine relationship between saccade size and movement duration, and the saturation of peak velocity with amplitude. To explain all these properties, we developed a computational model, based on a simplified and upscaled robotic prototype of an eye with 3 degrees of freedom, driven by three independent motor commands, coupled to three antagonistic elastic muscle pairs. As the robotic prototype was not intended to faithfully mimic the detailed biomechanics of the human eye, we did not impose specific prior mechanical constraints on the ocular plant that could, by themselves, generate Listing’s law and the main-sequence. Instead, our goal was to study how these properties can emerge from the application of optimal control principles to simplified eye models. We performed a numerical linearization of the nonlinear system dynamics around the origin using system identification techniques, and developed open-loop controllers for 3D saccade generation. Applying optimal control to the simulated model, could reproduce both Listing’s law and and the main-sequence. We verified the contribution of different terms in the cost optimization functional to realistic 3D saccade behavior, and identified four essential terms: total energy expenditure by the motors, movement duration, gaze accuracy, and the total static force exerted by the muscles during fixation. Our findings suggest that Listing’s law, as well as the saccade dynamics and their trajectories, may all emerge from the same common mechanism that aims to optimize speed-accuracy trade-off for saccades, while minimizing the total muscle force during eccentric fixation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7nEB9fufRJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We contrast two computational models of sequence learning. The associative learner posits that learning proceeds by strengthening existing association weights. Alternatively, recoding posits that learning creates new and more efficient representations of the learned sequences. Importantly, both models propose that humans act as optimal learners but capture different statistics of the stimuli in their internal model. Furthermore, these models make dissociable predictions as to how learning changes the neural representation of sequences. We tested these predictions by using fMRI to extract neural activity patters from the dorsal visual processing stream during a sequence recall task. We observed that only the recoding account can explain the similarity of neural activity patterns, suggesting that participants recode the learned sequences using chunks. We show that associative learning can theoretically store only very limited number of overlapping sequences, such as common in ecological working memory tasks, and hence an efficient learner should recode initial sequence representations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s2L3TsNT71U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Edwin Rodriguez Horta, Martin Weigt&lt;/p&gt;

Coevolution-based contact prediction, either directly by coevolutionary couplings resulting from global statistical sequence models or using structural supervision and deep learning, has found widespread application in protein-structure prediction from sequence. However, one of the basic assumptions in global statistical modeling is that sequences form an at least approximately independent sample of an unknown probability distribution, which is to be learned from data. In the case of protein families, this assumption is obviously violated by phylogenetic relations between protein sequences. It has turned out to be notoriously difficult to take phylogenetic correlations into account in coevolutionary model learning. Here, we propose a complementary approach: we develop strategies to randomize or resample sequence data, such that conservation patterns and phylogenetic relations are preserved, while intrinsic (i.e. structure- or function-based) coevolutionary couplings are removed. A comparison between the results of Direct Coupling Analysis applied to real and to resampled data shows that the largest coevolutionary couplings, i.e. those used for contact prediction, are only weakly influenced by phylogeny. However, the phylogeny-induced spurious couplings in the resampled data are compatible in size with the first false-positive contact predictions from real data. Dissecting functional from phylogeny-induced couplings might therefore extend accurate contact predictions to the range of intermediate-size couplings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rZ6uKv1LSrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During cell migration in confinement, the nucleus has to deform for a cell to pass through small constrictions. Such nuclear deformations require significant forces. A direct experimental measure of the deformation force field is extremely challenging. However, experimental images of nuclear shape are relatively easy to obtain. Therefore, here we present a method to calculate predictions of the deformation force field based purely on analysis of experimental images of nuclei before and after deformation. Such an inverse calculation is technically non-trivial and relies on a mechanical model for the nucleus. Here we compare two simple continuum elastic models of a cell nucleus undergoing deformation. In the first, we treat the nucleus as a homogeneous elastic solid and, in the second, as an elastic shell. For each of these models we calculate the force field required to produce the deformation given by experimental images of nuclei in dendritic cells migrating in microchannels with constrictions of controlled dimensions. These microfabricated channels provide a simplified confined environment mimicking that experienced by cells in tissues. Our calculations predict the forces felt by a deforming nucleus as a migrating cell encounters a constriction. Since a direct experimental measure of the deformation force field is very challenging and has not yet been achieved, our numerical approaches can make important predictions motivating further experiments, even though all the parameters are not yet available. We demonstrate the power of our method by showing how it predicts lateral forces corresponding to actin polymerisation around the nucleus, providing evidence for actin generated forces squeezing the sides of the nucleus as it enters a constriction. In addition, the algorithm we have developed could be adapted to analyse experimental images of deformation in other situations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VFNS8Ql34z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Genome-scale metabolic modelling when changes in environmental conditions affect biomass composition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008528</guid>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling is an important tool in the study of metabolism by enhancing the collation of knowledge, interpretation of data, and prediction of metabolic capabilities. A frequent assumption in the use of genome-scale models is that the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; organism is evolved for optimal growth, where growth is represented by flux through a biomass objective function (BOF). While the specific composition of the BOF is crucial, its formulation is often inherited from similar organisms due to the experimental challenges associated with its proper determination.
A cell’s macro-molecular composition is not fixed and it responds to changes in environmental conditions. As a consequence, initiatives for the high-fidelity determination of cellular biomass composition have been launched. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical and computational framework capable of using multiple measurements of cellular biomass composition in different environments. Here, we propose two different computational approaches for directly addressing this challenge: Biomass Trade-off Weighting (BTW) and Higher-dimensional-plane InterPolation (HIP).
In lieu of experimental data on biomass composition-variation in response to changing nutrient environment, we assess the properties of BTW and HIP using three hypothetical, yet biologically plausible, BOFs for the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome-scale metabolic model &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;ML1515. We find that the BTW and HIP formulations have a significant impact on model performance and phenotypes. Furthermore, the BTW method generates larger growth rates in all environments when compared to HIP. Using acetate secretion and the respiratory quotient as proxies for phenotypic changes, we find marked differences between the methods as HIP generates BOFs more similar to a reference BOF than BTW. We conclude that the presented methods constitute a conceptual step in developing genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches capable of addressing the inherent dependence of cellular biomass composition on nutrient environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a4MWgD3TmqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2006, during a meeting of a working group of scientists in La Jolla,
California at The Neurosciences Institute (NSI), Gerald Edelman described a
roadmap towards the creation of a Conscious Artifact. As far as I know, this
roadmap was not published. However, it did shape my thinking and that of many
others in the years since that meeting. This short paper, which is based on my
notes taken during the meeting, describes the key steps in this roadmap. I
believe it is as groundbreaking today as it was more than 15 years ago.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Multi-Horizon Forecasting for Limit Order Books: Novel Deep Learning Approaches and Hardware Acceleration using Intelligent Processing Units. (arXiv:2105.10430v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We design multi-horizon forecasting models for limit order book (LOB) data by
using deep learning techniques. Unlike standard structures where a single
prediction is made, we adopt encoder-decoder models with sequence-to-sequence
and Attention mechanisms, to generate a forecasting path. Our methods achieve
comparable performance to state-of-art algorithms at short prediction horizons.
Importantly, they outperform when generating predictions over long horizons by
leveraging the multi-horizon setup. Given that encoder-decoder models rely on
recurrent neural layers, they generally suffer from a slow training process. To
remedy this, we experiment with utilising novel hardware, so-called Intelligent
Processing Units (IPUs) produced by Graphcore. IPUs are specifically designed
for machine intelligence workload with the aim to speed up the computation
process. We show that in our setup this leads to significantly faster training
times when compared to training models with GPUs.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Discrete hybrid Izhikevich neuron model: nodal and network behaviours considering electromagnetic flux coupling. (arXiv:2105.10415v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10415</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10415</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We analyse the dynamics of the improved discretised version of the well known
Izhikevich neuronmodel under the action of external electromagnetic field. It
is found that the three-dimensional IZHmap shows rich dynamics. With the
variation of the electromagnetic field, period-doubling routeto chaos in a
repeating fashion is observed from the bifurcation diagram. Even the forward
andbackward continuation bifurcation diagram which do not completely overlap
suggests that there is multistability in the system. The phenomenon of
bistability (coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors) is observed. The
presence of periodic and chaotic attractor is aided by the maximal Lyapunov
exponent diagram. The Lyapunov phase diagram of electromagnetic field and
synapses current shows a large parameter region of chaotic and periodic
behaviors with the presence of unbounded regions as well. The IZH map shows a
plethora of spiking and bursting patterns such as mixed-mode patterns, tonic
spiking, phasic spiking, steady spikes, regular spikes, spike bursting,
periodic bursting, phasic bursting, chaotic firing, etc with the variation of
electromagnetic coupling strength and the synapses current. We also investigate
the presence of chimera states in a ring-star, ring, star network of IZH map
neurons. Chimera states are found in the case of ring-star and ring network
while synchronised clusters were found in the case of star network and are
aided by the spatiotemporal plots, space-time plot, recurrence plots. The rich
dynamics shown by the discretised IZH map makes it a promising research model
to study about neurodynamics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern electronic design automation (EDA) tools can handle the complexity of
state-of-the-art electronic systems by decomposing them into smaller blocks or
cells, introducing different levels of abstraction and staged design flows.
However, throughout each independent-optimised design step, overhead and
inefficiency can accumulate in the resulting overall design. Performing
design-specific optimisation from a more global viewpoint requires more time
due to the larger search space, but has the potential to provide solutions with
improved performance. In this work, a fully-automated, multi-objective (MO) EDA
flow is introduced to address this issue. It specifically tunes drive strength
mapping, preceding physical implementation, through multi-objective
population-based search algorithms. Designs are evaluated with respect to their
power, performance and area (PPA). The proposed approach is capable of
expanding the design space, offering a set of Pareto-optimised trade-off
solutions for different case-specific utilisation. We have applied the proposed
MOEDA framework to ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits using a commercial 65nm standard
cell library. The experimental results demonstrate how the MOEDA flow enhances
the solutions initially generated by the standard digital flow, and how
simultaneously a significant improvement in PPA metrics is achieved.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computation of the instantaneous phase and amplitude via the Hilbert
Transform is a powerful tool of data analysis. This approach finds many
applications in various science and engineering branches but is not proper for
causal estimation because it requires knowledge of the signal's past and
future. However, several problems require real-time estimation of phase and
amplitude; an illustrative example is phase-locked or amplitude-dependent
stimulation in neuroscience. In this paper, we discuss and compare three causal
algorithms that do not rely on the Hilbert Transform but exploit well-known
physical phenomena, the synchronization and the resonance. After testing the
algorithms on a synthetic data set, we illustrate their performance computing
phase and amplitude for the accelerometer tremor measurements and a
Parkinsonian patient's beta-band brain activity.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10335</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of
a deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which
randomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard
distributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more
informed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where
each layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is
cast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and
decoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a
user-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into
the well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free
solutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to
random initialization methods, both before start of training and after training
is over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot
and fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time
complexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition
performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The need for accurate yield estimates for viticulture is becoming more
important due to increasing competition in the wine market worldwide. One of
the most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can
be approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this
article, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries
with leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that
will enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial
networks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario
behind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded
berries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after
applying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to
applying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local
conditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.
Furthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image
should be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring
information about hidden areas.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: On the use of feature-maps and parameter control for improved quality-diversity meta-evolution. (arXiv:2105.10317v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10317</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10317</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, which evolve a behaviourally diverse
archive of high-performing solutions, the behaviour space is a difficult design
choice that should be tailored to the target application. In QD meta-evolution,
one evolves a population of QD algorithms to optimise the behaviour space based
on an archive-level objective, the meta-fitness. This paper proposes an
improved meta-evolution system such that (i) the database used to rapidly
populate new archives is reformulated to prevent loss of quality-diversity;
(ii) the linear transformation of base-features is generalised to a
feature-map, a function of the base-features parametrised by the meta-genotype;
and (iii) the mutation rate of the QD algorithm and the number of generations
per meta-generation are controlled dynamically. Experiments on an 8-joint
planar robot arm compare feature-maps (linear, non-linear, and
feature-selection), parameter control strategies (static, endogenous,
reinforcement learning, and annealing), and traditional MAP-Elites variants,
for a total of 49 experimental conditions. Results reveal that non-linear and
feature-selection feature-maps yield a 15-fold and 3-fold improvement in
meta-fitness, respectively, over linear feature-maps. Reinforcement learning
ranks among top parameter control methods. Finally, our approach allows the
robot arm to recover a reach of over 80% for most damages and at least 60% for
severe damages.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: AngularGrad: A New Optimization Technique for Angular Convergence of Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:2105.10190v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10190</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10190</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient
descent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)
optimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles
the dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still
unable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This
paper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the
direction/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the
literature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its
magnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size
based on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the
optimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate
past gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of
AngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for
computing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits
the same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods
reveal a superior performance of AngularGrad. The source code will be made
publicly available at: https://github.com/mhaut/AngularGrad.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10109</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical neurons develop receptive fields adapted to the statistics of the
environment. Synaptic plasticity models reproduce some of these response
properties, but so far require unrealistic assumptions about the statistics of
the incoming sensory signals, such as decorrelated inputs with identical firing
rates. Here we develop a theory for synaptic plasticity that is invariant to
second-order correlations in the input. Going beyond classical Hebbian
learning, we show that metaplastic long-term depression cancels the sensitivity
to second-order correlation, bringing out selectivity to higher-order
statistics. In contrast, alternative stabilization mechanisms, such as
heterosynaptic depression, increase the sensitivity to input correlations. Our
simulations demonstrate how correlation-invariant plasticity models can learn
latent patterns despite perturbations in input statistics without the need for
whitening. The theory advances our understanding of local unsupervised learning
in cortical circuits and assigns a precise functional role to synaptic
depression mechanisms in pyramidal neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Camera movement and unpredictable environmental conditions like dust and wind
induce noise into video feeds. We observe that popular unsupervised MOT methods
are dependent on noise-free conditions. We show that the addition of a small
amount of artificial random noise causes a sharp degradation in model
performance on benchmark metrics. We resolve this problem by introducing a
robust unsupervised multi-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net. The proposed
single-head attention model helps limit the negative impact of noise by
learning visual representations at different segment scales. AttU-Net shows
better unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based
state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate our method in the MNIST and the Atari
game video benchmark. We also provide two extended video datasets consisting of
complex visual patterns that include Kuzushiji characters and fashion images to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07209</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces Non-Autonomous Input-Output Stable Network(NAIS-Net), a
very deep architecture where each stacked processing block is derived from a
time-invariant non-autonomous dynamical system. Non-autonomy is implemented by
skip connections from the block input to each of the unrolled processing stages
and allows stability to be enforced so that blocks can be unrolled adaptively
to a pattern-dependent processing depth. NAIS-Net induces non-trivial,
Lipschitz input-output maps, even for an infinite unroll length. We prove that
the network is globally asymptotically stable so that for every initial
condition there is exactly one input-dependent equilibrium assuming $tanh$
units, and incrementally stable for ReL units. An efficient implementation that
enforces the stability under derived conditions for both fully-connected and
convolutional layers is also presented. Experimental results show how NAIS-Net
exhibits stability in practice, yielding a significant reduction in
generalization gap compared to ResNets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 24 May 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23371-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23371-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed C−H cyclization for medium-ring synthesis has been limited to reactive C−H bonds, the activation of unreactive C−H bonds still remains a challenge. Here the authors show the direct construction of 7-membered rings via Ni−Al co-catalyzed unreactive C−H cyclization of benzoimidazoles with alkenes, providing a series of tricyclic imidazoles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/wBF-Y1_-PyQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Here, the authors demonstrate 100x signal enhancement via an all-dielectric approach, using a silicon nanodisk array and exploiting its dark mode.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/cZSmDC_fUvI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To characterize patients with acute ischemic stroke related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the classification performance of clinical and laboratory parameters in predicting in-hospital outcome of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06–2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05–2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17–5.02). The RF model based on six clinical and laboratory parameters exhibited high cross-validated classification accuracy (0.86) and precision (0.87), good recall (0.72) and F1-score (0.79) in predicting in-hospital death.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients have distinctive risk factor profile and etiology, increased clinical severity and higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 patients. A simple model based on clinical and routine laboratory parameters may be useful in identifying ischemic stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are unlikely to survive the acute phase.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Neurological update: cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10618-2</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognitive impairment is a common and debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS). There is limited evidence that disease-modifying therapies are effective in treating cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive rehabilitation is a promising approach to treat cognitive dysfunction in MS, gaining empirical support over the last 10 years. The current review will provide a brief overview of cognitive rehabilitation in MS. Overall, there is evidence that cognitive rehabilitation programs (either restorative or compensatory) are efficacious in treating MS-related cognitive dysfunction. Clinicians should consider this low-cost, low-risk, yet effective treatment approach for their patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The goals of this study were to assess the ability of salivary non-coding RNA (ncRNA) levels to predict post-concussion symptoms lasting ≥ 21 days, and to examine the ability of ncRNAs to identify recovery compared to cognition and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RNA sequencing was performed on 505 saliva samples obtained longitudinally from 112 individuals (8–24-years-old) with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Initial samples were obtained ≤ 14 days post-injury, and follow-up samples were obtained ≥ 21 days post-injury. Computerized balance and cognitive test performance were assessed at initial and follow-up time-points. Machine learning was used to define: (1) a model employing initial ncRNA levels to predict persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) ≥ 21 days post-injury; and (2) a model employing follow-up ncRNA levels to identify symptom recovery. Performance of the models was compared against a validated clinical prediction rule, and balance/cognitive test performance, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An algorithm using age and 16 ncRNAs predicted PPCS with greater accuracy than the validated clinical tool and demonstrated additive combined utility (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86; 95% CI 0.84–0.88). Initial balance and cognitive test performance did not differ between PPCS and non-PPCS groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Follow-up balance and cognitive test performance identified symptom recovery with similar accuracy to a model using 11 ncRNAs and age. A combined model (ncRNAs, balance, cognition) most accurately identified recovery (AUC 0.86; 95% CI 0.83–0.89).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ncRNA biomarkers show promise for tracking recovery from mTBI, and for predicting who will have prolonged symptoms. They could provide accurate expectations for recovery, stratify need for intervention, and guide safe return-to-activities.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The signing body: extensive sign language practice shapes the size of hands and face</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06121-9</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The representation of the metrics of the hands is distorted, but is susceptible to malleability due to expert dexterity (magicians) and long-term tool use (baseball players). However, it remains unclear whether modulation leads to a stable representation of the hand that is adopted in every circumstance, or whether the modulation is closely linked to the spatial context where the expertise occurs. To this aim, a group of 10 experienced Sign Language (SL) interpreters were recruited to study the selective influence of expertise and space localisation in the metric representation of hands. Experiment 1 explored differences in hands’ size representation between the SL interpreters and 10 age-matched controls in near-reaching (Condition 1) and far-reaching space (Condition 2), using the localisation task. SL interpreters presented reduced hand size in near-reaching condition, with characteristic underestimation of finger lengths, and reduced overestimation of hands and wrists widths in comparison with controls. This difference was lost in far-reaching space, confirming the effect of expertise on hand representations is closely linked to the spatial context where an action is performed. As SL interpreters are also experts in the use of their face with communication purposes, the effects of expertise in the metrics of the face were also studied (Experiment 2). SL interpreters were more accurate than controls, with overall reduction of width overestimation. Overall, expertise modifies the representation of relevant body parts in a specific and context-dependent manner. Hence, different representations of the same body part can coexist simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Network Path Convergence Shapes Low-Level Processing in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.645709</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical counterstream via feedforward and feedback interactions is a major organizing principle of the cerebral cortex. The counterstream, as a topological feature of the network of cortical areas, is captured by the convergence and divergence of paths through directed links. So defined, the convergence degree (CD) reveals the reciprocal nature of forward and backward connections, and also hierarchically relevant integrative properties of areas through their inward and outward connections. We asked if topology shapes large-scale cortical functioning by studying the role of CD in network resilience and Granger causal coupling in a model of hierarchical network dynamics. Our results indicate that topological synchronizability is highly vulnerable to attacking edges based on CD, while global network efficiency depends mostly on edge betweenness, a measure of the connectedness of a link. Furthermore, similar to anatomical hierarchy determined by the laminar distribution of connections, CD highly correlated with causal coupling in feedforward gamma, and feedback alpha-beta band synchronizations in a well-studied subnetwork, including low-level visual cortical areas. In contrast, causal coupling did not correlate with edge betweenness. Considering the entire network, the CD-based hierarchy correlated well with both the anatomical and functional hierarchy for low-level areas that are far apart in the hierarchy. Conversely, in a large part of the anatomical network where hierarchical distances are small between the areas, the correlations were not significant. These findings suggest that CD-based and functional hierarchies are interrelated in low-level processing in the visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the idea that the interplay of multiple hierarchical features forms the basis of flexible functional cortical interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Invaginating Structures in Synapses – Perspective</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.685052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.685052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Invaginating structures are common in the synapses of most animals. However, the details of these invaginating structures remain understudied in part because they are not well resolved in light microscopy and were often misidentified in early electron microscope (EM) studies. Utilizing experimental techniques along with the latest advances in microscopy, such as focused ion beam-scanning EM (FIB-SEM), evidence is gradually building to suggest that the synaptic invaginating structures contribute to synapse development, maintenance, and plasticity. These invaginating structures are most elaborate in synapses mediating rapid integration of signals, such as muscle contraction, mechanoreception, and vision. Here we argue that the synaptic invaginations should be considered in future studies seeking to understand their role in sensory integration and coordination, learning, and memory. We review the various types of invaginating structures in the synapses and discuss their potential functions. We also present several new examples of invaginating structures from a variety of animals including Drosophila and mice, mainly using FIB-SEM, with which we trace the form and arrangement of these structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: GluN2D NMDA Receptors Gate Fear Extinction Learning and Interneuron Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.681068</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.681068</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is critically involved in the formation of associative fear memory and in subsequent extinction learning. Fear conditioning is associated with a long-term potentiation at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells. We therefore tested whether fear conditioning unmasks novel forms of synaptic plasticity, which enable subsequent extinction learning to reset cerebellar circuitry. We found that fear learning enhanced GABA release from molecular layer interneurons and this was reversed after fear extinction learning. Importantly an extinction-like stimulation of parallel fibers after fear learning is sufficient to induce a lasting decrease in inhibitory transmission (I-LTD&lt;sub&gt;stim&lt;/sub&gt;) in the cerebellar cortex, a form of plasticity that is absent in naïve animals. While NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are required for the formation and extinction of associative memory, the role of GluN2D, one of the four major NMDA receptor subunits, in learning and memory has not been determined. We found that fear conditioning elevates spontaneous GABA release in GluN2D KO as shown in WT mice. Deletion of GluN2D, however, abolished the I-LTD&lt;sub&gt;stim&lt;/sub&gt; induced by parallel fiber stimulation after learning. At the behavioral level, genetic deletion of GluN2D subunits did not affect associative learning and memory retention, but impaired subsequent fear extinction learning. D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist, failed to rescue extinction learning in mutant mice. Our results identify GluN2D as a critical NMDAR subunit for extinction learning and reveal a form of GluN2D-dependent metaplasticity that is associated with extinction in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cochlin Deficiency Protects Against Noise-Induced Hearing Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.670013</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cochlin is the most abundant protein in the inner ear. To study its function in response to noise trauma, we exposed adolescent wild-type (Coch&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cochlin knock-out (Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice to noise (8–16 kHz, 103 dB SPL, 2 h) that causes a permanent threshold shift and hair cell loss. Two weeks after noise exposure, Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had substantially less elevation in noise-induced auditory thresholds and hair cell loss than Coch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, consistent with cochlin deficiency providing protection from noise trauma. Comparison of pre-noise exposure thresholds of auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and Coch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; littermates revealed a small and significant elevation in thresholds of Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, overall consistent with a small conductive hearing loss in Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We show quantitatively that the pro-inflammatory component of cochlin, LCCL, is upregulated after noise exposure in perilymph of wild-type mice compared to unexposed mice, as is the enzyme catalyzing LCCL release, aggrecanase1, encoded by Adamts4. We further show that upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in perilymph and cochlear soft-tissue after noise exposure is lower in cochlin knock-out than wild-type mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that cochlin deficiency results in conductive hearing loss that protects against physiologic and molecular effects of noise trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alzheimer’s Disease and microRNA-132: A Widespread Pathological Factor and Potential Therapeutic Target</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687973</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687973</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly and is the most common type of dementia. AD is mostly gradual onset, and involves slow, progressive mental decline, accompanied by personality changes; the incidence of AD gradually increases with age. The etiology of AD is unknown, although it is currently believed to be related to abnormal deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain, hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau, and the release of various cytokines, complements, activators and chemokines by cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly conserved non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and manipulate the functions of intracellular proteins and physiological processes. Emerging studies have shown that miRNA plays an important role in regulating AD-related genes. MiR-132 is known as “NeurimmiR” due to its involvement in numerous neurophysiological and pathological processes. Accumulating pre-clinical results suggest that miR-132 may be involved in the progression of Aβ and tau pathology. Moreover, clinical studies have indicated that decreased circulating miR-132 levels could be used a potential diagnostic biomarker in AD. Here, we review the pathogenic role of miR-132 activity in AD, and the potential of targeting miR-132 for developing future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Loss of Rbfox1 Does Not Affect Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells Injured by Optic Nerve Crush</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687690</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687690</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rbfox1 is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that regulates alternative splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and translation. Its roles in neurogenesis and neuronal functions are well established. Recent studies also implicate Rbfox1 in the regulation of gene networks that support cell survival during stress. We have earlier characterized the expression of Rbfox1 in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and showed that deletion of Rbfox1 in adult animals results in depth perception deficiency. The current study investigates the effect of Rbfox1 downregulation on survival of RGCs injured by optic nerve crush (ONC). Seven days after ONC, animals sustained severe degeneration of RGC axons in the optic nerve and significant loss of RGC somas. Semi-quantitative grading of optic nerve damage in control + ONC, control + tamoxifen + ONC, and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC groups ranged from 4.6 to 4.8 on a scale of 1 (normal; no degenerated axons were noted) to 5 (total degeneration; all axons showed degenerated organelles, axonal content, and myelin sheath), indicating a severe degeneration. Among these three ONC groups, no statistical significance was observed when any two groups were compared. The number of RGC somas were quantitatively analyzed in superior, inferior, nasal and temporal retinal quadrants at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mm from the center of the optic disc. The average RGC densities (cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were: control 6,438 ± 1,203; control + ONC 2,779 ± 573; control + tamoxifen 6,163 ± 861; control + tamoxifen + ONC 2,573 ± 555; Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; 6,437 ± 893; and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC 2,537 ± 526. The RGC loss in control + ONC, control + tamoxifen + ONC and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC was 57% (P = 1.44954E-42), 58% (P = 1.37543E-57) and 61% (P = 5.552E-59) compared to RGC numbers in the relevant uninjured groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between any two groups of uninjured animals or between any two ONC groups. Our data indicate that Rbfox1-mediated pathways have no effect on survival of RGCs injured by ONC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Tracing Neurological Diseases in the Presymptomatic Phase: Insights From Neurofilament Light Chain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The identification of neurological diseases in their presymptomatic phase will be a fundamental aim in the coming years. This step is necessary both to optimize early diagnostics and to verify the effectiveness of experimental disease modifying drugs in the early stages of diseases. Among the biomarkers that can detect neurological diseases already in their preclinical phase, neurofilament light chain (NfL) has given the most promising results. Recently, its measurement in serum has enabled the identification of neurodegeneration in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) up to 6–10 years before the onset of symptoms. Similar results have been obtained in conditions such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), up to 2 years before clinical onset. Study of the longitudinal dynamics of serum NfL has also revealed interesting aspects of the pathophysiology of these diseases in the preclinical phase. This review sought to discuss these very recent findings on serum NfL in the presymptomatic phase of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2): Confusing Roles in the Pathophysiology of Neurological Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.614107</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a type of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-dependent deacetylases, sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is predominantly found in the cytoplasm of cells in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting its potential role in neurological disorders. Though SIRT2 is generally acknowledged to accelerate the development of neurological pathologies, it protects the brain from deterioration in certain circumstances. This review summarized the complex roles SIRT2 plays in the pathophysiology of diverse neurological disorders, compared and analyzed the discrete roles of SIRT2 in different conditions, and provided possible explanations for its paradoxical functions. In the future, the rapid growth in SIRT2 research may clarify its impacts on neurological disorders and develop therapeutic strategies targeting this protein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: In-Bed Sensorimotor Rehabilitation in Early and Late Subacute Stroke Using a Wearable Elbow Robot: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669059</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669059</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objects: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of in-bed wearable elbow robot training for motor recovery in patients with early and late subacute stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eleven in-patient stroke survivors (male/female: 7/4, age: 50.7 ± 10.6 years, post-stroke duration: 2.6 ± 1.9 months) received 15 sessions of training over about 4 weeks of hospital stay. During each hourly training, participants received passive stretching and active movement training with motivating games using a wearable elbow rehabilitation robot. Isometric maximum muscle strength (MVC) of elbow flexors and extensors was evaluated using the robot at the beginning and end of each training session. Clinical measures including Fugl-Meyer Assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), Motricity Index (MI) for upper extremities, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) were measured at baseline, after the 4-week training program, and at a 1-month follow-up. The muscle strength recovery curve over the training period was characterized as a logarithmic learning curve with three parameters (i.e., initial muscle strength, rate of improvement, and number of the training session).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At the baseline, participants had moderate to severe upper limb motor impairment {FMA-UE [median (interquartile range)]: 28 (18–45)} and mild spasticity in elbow flexors {MAS [median (interquartile range)]: 0 (0–1)}. After about 4 weeks of training, significant improvements were observed in FMA-UE (p = 0.003) and MI (p = 0.005), and the improvements were sustained at the follow-up. The elbow flexors MVC significantly increased by 1.93 Nm (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.93 Nm, p = 0.017) and the elbow extensor MVC increased by 0.68 Nm (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.98 Nm, p = 0.036). Muscle strength recovery curve showed that patients with severe upper limb motor impairment had a greater improvement rate in elbow flexor strength than those with moderate motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In-bed wearable elbow robotic rehabilitation is feasible and effective in improving biomechanical and clinical outcomes for early and late subacute stroke in-patients. Results from the pilot study suggested that patients with severe upper limb motor impairment may benefit more from the robot training compared to those with moderate impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Event-Based Trajectory Prediction Using Spiking Neural Networks</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.658764</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, event-based sensors have been combined with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to create a new generation of bio-inspired artificial vision systems. These systems can process spatio-temporal data in real time, and are highly energy efficient. In this study, we used a new hybrid event-based camera in conjunction with a multi-layer spiking neural network trained with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. We showed that neurons learn from repeated and correlated spatio-temporal patterns in an unsupervised way and become selective to motion features, such as direction and speed. This motion selectivity can then be used to predict ball trajectory by adding a simple read-out layer composed of polynomial regressions, and trained in a supervised manner. Hence, we show that a SNN receiving inputs from an event-based sensor can extract relevant spatio-temporal patterns to process and predict ball trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Complex-Valued Oscillatory Neural Network for Storage and Retrieval of Multidimensional Aperiodic Signals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks with associative memory properties are typically based on fixed-point dynamics, which is fundamentally distinct from the oscillatory dynamics of the brain. There have been proposals for oscillatory associative memories, but here too, in the majority of cases, only binary patterns are stored as oscillatory states in the network. Oscillatory neural network models typically operate at a single/common frequency. At multiple frequencies, even a pair of oscillators with real coupling exhibits rich dynamics of Arnold tongues, not easily harnessed to achieve reliable memory storage and retrieval. Since real brain dynamics comprises of a wide range of spectral components, there is a need for oscillatory neural network models that operate at multiple frequencies. We propose an oscillatory neural network that can model multiple time series simultaneously by performing a Fourier-like decomposition of the signals. We show that these enhanced properties of a network of Hopf oscillators become possible by operating in the complex-variable domain. In this model, the single neural oscillator is modeled as a Hopf oscillator, with adaptive frequency and dynamics described over the complex domain. We propose a novel form of coupling, dubbed “power coupling,” between complex Hopf oscillators. With power coupling, expressed naturally only in the complex-variable domain, it is possible to achieve stable (normalized) phase relationships in a network of multifrequency oscillators. Network connections are trained either by Hebb-like learning or by delta rule, adapted to the complex domain. The network is capable of modeling N-channel electroencephalogram time series with high accuracy and shows the potential as an effective model of large-scale brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: BACHD Mice Recapitulate the Striatal Parvalbuminergic Interneuron Loss Found in Huntington’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, psychiatric, and cognitive abnormalities. Neurodegeneration is prominently observed in the striatum where GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN) are the most affected neuronal population. Interestingly, recent reports of pathological changes in HD patient striatal tissue have identified a significant reduction in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons which becomes more robust in tissues of higher disease grade. Analysis of other interneuron populations, including somatostatin, calretinin, and cholinergic, did not reveal significant neurodegeneration. Electrophysiological experiments in BACHD mice have identified significant changes in the properties of parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons in the striatum. Furthermore, their interactions with MSNs are altered as the mHTT expressing mouse models age with increased input onto MSNs from striatal somatostatin and parvalbumin-expressing neurons. In order to determine whether BACHD mice recapitulate the alterations in striatal interneuron number as observed in HD patients, we analyzed the number of striatal parvalbumin, somatostatin, calretinin, and choline acetyltransferase positive cells in symptomatic 12–14 month-old mice by immunofluorescent labeling. We observed a significant decrease in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as well as a decrease in the area and perimeter of these cells. No significant changes were observed for somatostatin, calretinin, or cholinergic interneuron numbers while a significant decrease was observed for the area of cholinergic interneurons. Thus, the BACHD mice recapitulate the degenerative phenotype observed in the parvalbumin interneurons in HD patient striata without affecting the number of other interneuron populations in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Molecular Characterization of Superficial Layers of the Presubiculum During Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.662724</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.662724</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presubiculum, a subarea of the parahippocampal region, plays a critical role in spatial navigation and spatial representation. An outstanding aspect of presubicular spatial codes is head-direction selectivity of the firing of excitatory neurons, called head-direction cells. Head-direction selectivity emerges before eye-opening in rodents and is maintained in adulthood through neurophysiological interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the presubiculum has been physiologically profiled in terms of spatial representation during development, the histological characteristics of the developing presubiculum are poorly understood. We found that the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) could be used to delimit the superficial layers of the presubiculum, which was identified using an anterograde tracer injected into the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN). Thus, we immunostained slices from mice ranging in age from neonates to adults using an antibody against VGluT2 to evaluate the VGluT2-positive area, which was identified as the superficial layers of the presubiculum, during development. We also immunostained the slices using antibodies against parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) and found that in the presubicular superficial layers, PV-positive neurons progressively increased in number during development, whereas SOM-positive neurons exhibited no increasing trend. In addition, we observed repeating patch structures in presubicular layer III from postnatal days 12. The abundant expression of VGluT2 suggests that the presubicular superficial layers are regulated primarily by VGluT2-mediated excitatory neurotransmission. Moreover, developmental changes in the densities of PV- and SOM-positive interneurons and the emergence of the VGluT2-positive patch structures during adolescence may be associated with the functional development of spatial codes in the superficial layers of the presubiculum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Is There Any Association Between Neurodegenerative Diseases and Periodontitis? A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.651437</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.651437</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of progressive disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and multiple sclerosis. Inflammation plays a critical role in the onset and progression of these injuries. Periodontitis is considered an inflammatory disease caused by oral biofilms around the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to a systemic and chronic inflammatory condition. Thus, this systematic review aimed to search for evidence in the association between neurodegenerative disorders and periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This systematic review was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the code CRD 42016038327. The search strategy was performed in three electronic databases and one gray literature source—PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and OpenGrey, based on the PECO acronym: observational studies in humans (P) in which a neurodegenerative disease was present (E) or absent (C) to observe an association with periodontitis (O). The Fowkes and Fulton checklist was used to critically appraise the methodological quality and the risk of bias of individual studies. The quality of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: From 534 articles found, 12 were included, of which eight were case–control, three were cross-sectional, and one was a cohort, giving a total of 3,460 participants. All the included studies reported an association between some neurodegenerative diseases and periodontitis and presented a low risk of bias. According to the GRADE approach, the level of evidence of probing pocket depth was considered very low due to the significant heterogeneity across the studies' upgrading imprecision and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although all the included studies in this review reported an association between neurodegenerative diseases and periodontitis, the level of evidence was classified to be very low, which suggests a cautious interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Behavioral Impairment Is Associated With Atrophy of Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus in a Memory Clinic Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.643271</guid>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a syndrome describing late-onset persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in non-demented older adults. Few studies to date have investigated the associations of MBI with structural brain changes. Our aim was to explore structural correlates of NPS in a non-demented memory clinic sample using the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) that has been developed to measure MBI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred sixteen non-demented older adults from the Czech Brain Aging Study with subjective cognitive concerns were classified as subjective cognitive decline (n = 37) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 79). Participants underwent neurological and neuropsychological examinations and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1.5 T). The Czech version of the MBI-C was administered to participants’ informants. Five a priori selected brain regions were measured, namely, thicknesses of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and entorhinal cortex (ERC) and volume of the hippocampus (HV), and correlated with MBI-C total and domain scores.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Entorhinal cortex was associated with MBI-C total score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.368, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and with impulse dyscontrol score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.284, p = 0.002). HV was associated with decreased motivation (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.248, p = 0.008) and impulse dyscontrol score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.240, p = 0.011).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly in the MBI impulse dyscontrol and motivation domains, are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in a clinical cohort of non-demented older adults. This study supports earlier involvement of temporal rather than frontal regions in NPS manifestation. Since these regions are typically affected early in the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the MBI-C may potentially help further identify individuals at-risk of developing AD dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ESCRT-III polymerization is required for all endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent events in the cell. However, the relative contributions of the eight ESCRT-III subunits differ between each process. The minimal features of ESCRT-III proteins necessary for function and the role for the multiple ESCRT-III subunits remain unclear. To identify essential features of ESCRT-III subunits, we previously studied the polymerization mechanisms of two ESCRT-III subunits Snf7 and Vps24, identifying the association of the helix-4 region of Snf7 with the helix-1 region of Vps24 (Banjade et al., 2019a). Here, we find that mutations in the helix-1 region of another ESCRT-III subunit Vps2 can functionally replace Vps24 in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Engineering and genetic selections revealed the required features of both subunits. Our data allow us to propose three minimal features required for ESCRT-III function – spiral formation, lateral association of the spirals through heteropolymerization, and binding to the AAA + ATPase Vps4 for dynamic remodeling.</description>

	<title>eLife: A phosphorylation of RIPK3 kinase initiates an intracellular apoptotic pathway that promotes prostaglandin2α-induced corpus luteum regression</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67409</link>
	<description>Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) normally signals to necroptosis by phosphorylating MLKL. We report here that when the cellular RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37 level is low, RIPK3 also signals to apoptosis. The apoptotic function of RIPK3 requires phosphorylation of the serine 165/threonine 166 sites on its kinase activation loop, resulting in inactivation of RIPK3 kinase activity while gaining the ability to recruit RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 to form a cytosolic caspase-activating complex, thereby triggering apoptosis. We found that PGF&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; induces RIPK3 expression in luteal granulosa cells in the ovary to cause luteal regression through this RIPK3-mediated apoptosis pathway. Mice carrying homozygous phosphorylation-resistant RIPK3 S165A/T166A knockin mutations failed to respond to PGF&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; but retained pro-necroptotic function, whereas mice with phospho-mimicking S165D/T166E homozygous knock-in mutation underwent spontaneous apoptosis in multiple RIPK3-expressing tissues and died shortly after birth. Thus, RIPK3 signals to either necroptosis or apoptosis depending on its serine 165/threonine 166 phosphorylation status.</description>

	<title>eLife: Midbrain dopaminergic inputs gate amygdala intercalated cell clusters by distinct and cooperative mechanisms in male mice</title>

	<description>Dopaminergic signaling plays an important role in associative learning, including fear and extinction learning. Dopaminergic midbrain neurons encode prediction error-like signals when threats differ from expectations. Within the amygdala, GABAergic intercalated cell (ITC) clusters receive one of the densest dopaminergic projections, but their physiological consequences are incompletely understood. ITCs are important for fear extinction, a function thought to be supported by activation of ventromedial ITCs that inhibit central amygdala fear output. In mice, we reveal two distinct novel mechanisms by which mesencephalic dopaminergic afferents control ITCs. Firstly, they co-release GABA to mediate rapid, direct inhibition. Secondly, dopamine suppresses inhibitory interactions between distinct ITC clusters via presynaptic D1 receptors. Early extinction training augments both GABA co-release onto dorsomedial ITCs and dopamine-mediated suppression of dorso- to ventromedial inhibition between ITC clusters. These findings provide novel insights into dopaminergic mechanisms shaping the activity balance between distinct ITC clusters that could support their opposing roles in fear behavior.</description>

	<description>While high risk of failure is an inherent part of developing innovative therapies, it can be reduced by adherence to evidence-based rigorous research practices. Numerous analyses conducted to date have clearly identified measures that need to be taken to improve research rigor. Supported through the European Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative, the EQIPD consortium has developed a novel preclinical research quality system that can be applied in both public and private sectors and is free for anyone to use. The EQIPD Quality System was designed to be suited to boost innovation by ensuring the generation of robust and reliable preclinical data while being lean, effective and not becoming a burden that could negatively impact the freedom to explore scientific questions. EQIPD defines research quality as the extent to which research data are fit for their intended use. Fitness, in this context, is defined by the stakeholders, who are the scientists directly involved in the research, but also their funders, sponsors, publishers, research tool manufacturers and collaboration partners such as peers in a multi-site research project. The essence of the EQIPD Quality System is the set of 18 core requirements that can be addressed flexibly, according to user-specific needs and following a user-defined trajectory. The EQIPD Quality System proposes guidance on expectations for quality-related measures, defines criteria for adequate processes (i.e., performance standards) and provides examples of how such measures can be developed and implemented. However, it does not prescribe any pre-determined solutions. EQIPD has also developed tools (for optional use) to support users in implementing the system and assessment services for those research units that successfully implement the quality system and seek formal accreditation. Building upon the feedback from users and continuous improvement, a sustainable EQIPD Quality System will ultimately serve the entire community of scientists conducting non-regulated preclinical research, by helping them generate reliable data that are fit for their intended use.</description>

	<title>eLife: Place-cell capacity and volatility with grid-like inputs</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62702</link>
	<description>What factors constrain the arrangement of the multiple fields of a place cell? By modeling place cells as perceptrons that act on multiscale periodic grid-cell inputs, we analytically enumerate a place cell's &lt;i&gt;repertoire&lt;/i&gt; - how many field arrangements it can realize without external cues while its grid inputs are unique; and derive its &lt;i&gt;capacity&lt;/i&gt; - the spatial range over which it can achieve any field arrangement. We show that the repertoire is very large and relatively noise-robust. However, the repertoire is a vanishing fraction of all arrangements, while capacity scales only as the sum of the grid periods so field arrangements are constrained over larger distances. Thus, grid-driven place field arrangements define a large response scaffold that is strongly constrained by its structured inputs. Finally, we show that altering grid-place weights to generate an arbitrary new place field strongly affects existing arrangements, which could explain the volatility of the place code.</description>

	<description>Invasion of human erythrocytes by the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is a multi-step process. Previously, a forward genetic screen for &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; host factors identified erythrocyte CD55 as essential for invasion, but its specific role and how it interfaces with the other factors that mediate this complex process are unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, antibody-based inhibition, and live cell imaging, here we show that CD55 is specifically required for parasite internalization. Pre-invasion kinetics, erythrocyte deformability, and echinocytosis were not influenced by CD55, but entry was inhibited when CD55 was blocked or absent. Visualization of parasites attached to CD55-null erythrocytes point to a role for CD55 in stability and/or progression of the moving junction. Our findings demonstrate that CD55 acts after discharge of the parasite's rhoptry organelles, and plays a unique role relative to all other invasion receptors. As the requirement for CD55 is strain-transcendent, these results suggest that CD55 or its interacting partners may hold potential as therapeutic targets for malaria.</description>

	<description>The Wnt-pathway is part of a signalling network that regulates many aspects of cell biology. Recently we discovered crosstalk between AMPA/Kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and the Wnt-pathway during the initial Wnt3a-interaction at the cytonemes of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we demonstrate that this crosstalk persists throughout the Wnt3a-response in ESCs. Both AMPA- and Kainate-receptors regulate early Wnt3a-recruitment, dynamics on the cell membrane, and orientation of the spindle towards a Wnt3a-source at mitosis. AMPA-receptors specifically are required for segregating cell fate components during Wnt3a-mediated asymmetric cell division (ACD). Using Wnt-pathway component knockout lines, we determine that Wnt co-receptor Lrp6 has particular functionality over Lrp5 in cytoneme formation, and in facilitating ACD. Both Lrp5 and 6, alongside pathway effector β-catenin act in concert to mediate the positioning of the dynamic interaction with, and spindle orientation to, a localized Wnt3a-source. Wnt-iGluR crosstalk may prove pervasive throughout embryonic and adult stem cell signalling.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56645</link>
	<description>The mechanisms that govern thalamocortical transmission are poorly understood. Recent data have shown that sensory stimuli elicit activity in ensembles of cortical neurons that recapitulate stereotyped spontaneous activity patterns. Here, we elucidate a possible mechanism by which gating of patterned population cortical activity occurs. In this study, sensory-evoked all-or-none cortical population responses were observed in the mouse auditory cortex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and similar stochastic cortical responses were observed in a colliculo-thalamocortical brain slice preparation. Cortical responses were associated with decreases in auditory thalamic synaptic inhibition and increases in thalamic synchrony. Silencing of corticothalamic neurons in layer 6 (but not layer 5) or the thalamic reticular nucleus linearized the cortical responses, suggesting that layer 6 corticothalamic feedback via the thalamic reticular nucleus was responsible for gating stochastic cortical population responses. These data implicate a corticothalamic-thalamic reticular nucleus circuit that modifies thalamic neuronal synchronization to recruit populations of cortical neurons for sensory representations.</description>

	<description>In Alzheimers disease, the microtubule-associated protein, Tau misfolds to form aggregates and filaments in the intra- and extracellular region of neuronal cells. Microglial cells are the resident brain macrophage cells that are involved in constant surveillance and are activated by the extracellular deposits. Purinergic receptors are involved in chemotactic migration of microglial cells towards the site of inflammation. In our recent study, we found that microglial P2Y12 receptor has been involved in phagocytosis of full-length Tau species such as monomers, oligomers and aggregates by actin-driven chemotaxis. In this study, we have showed the interaction of repeat-domain of Tau (TauRD) with microglial P2Y12 receptor and analysed the corresponding residues for interaction by various in-silico approaches. In cellular studies, TauRD was found to interact with microglial P2Y12R and induces its cellular expression as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis respectively. Similarly, immunofluorescence microscopic studies emphasized that TauRD were phagocytosed by microglial P2Y12R via the membrane-associated actin remodelling as filopodia extension. Furthermore, the P2Y12R-mediated TauRD internalization has activated the microglia with an increase in the Iba1 level and TauRD become accumulated at peri-nuclear region as localized with Iba1. Altogether, microglial P2Y12R interacts with TauRD and mediates directed migration and activation for its internalization.</description>

	<description>Quantifying brain state transition cost is a fundamental problem in systems neuroscience. Previous studies utilized network control theory to measure the cost by considering a neural system as a deterministic dynamical system. However, this approach does not capture the stochasticity of neural systems, which is important for accurately quantifying brain state transition cost. Here, we propose a novel framework based on optimal control in stochastic systems. In our framework, we quantify the transition cost as the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an uncontrolled transition path to the optimally controlled path, which is known as Schrodinger's bridge. To test its utility, we applied this framework to functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project and computed the brain state transition cost in cognitive tasks. We demonstrate correspondence between brain state transition cost and the difficulty of tasks. The results suggest that our framework provides a general theoretical tool for investigating cognitive functions from the viewpoint of transition cost.</description>

	<description>The brain's functional connectivity architecture (functional connectome) is dynamic, constantly reconfiguring in an individual-specific manner and contributing to inter-individual variability in cognitive performances. However, to what extent genetic effects shape the dynamic reconfigurations of the functional connectome is largely unknown. This paper assesses whether dynamic connectome features are heritable, quantifies their heritability, and explores their association with cognitive phenotypes. We identified discrete connectome states from resting-state fMRI data (n = 1003 including twins and non-twin siblings) and obtained multivariate features, each describing temporal or spatial characteristics of connectome dynamics. We found strong evidence that the temporal features, particularly fractional occupancy (FO) and transition probability (TP), were heritable. Importantly, a substantial proportion of phenotypic variance of these features (35% of FO and 41% of TP) was explained by genetic effects. The effect was stable after adjusting for head motion, independent of global signal regression and the chosen number of states, and absent in surrogate data. Contrarily, the data did not provide robust support for heritability of spatial features suggesting that genetic effects primarily contribute to how the connectome transitions across states, rather than the precise way in which the states are spatially instantiated. Notably, temporal phenotypes also captured variability in cognitive performance. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between genetic makeup and temporal reconfigurations of the functional connectome, suggesting that dynamic features may act as endophenotypes for cognitive abilities. In conclusion, we propose that connectome dynamics offer considerable potential as a theoretical, conceptual, and practical framework for linking genetics to behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Automated detection of artefacts in neonatal EEG with residual neural networks</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.23.445349v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background and Objective: To develop a computational algorithm that detects and identifies different artefact types in neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Methods: As part of a larger algorithm, we trained a Residual Deep Neural Network on expert human annotations of EEG recordings from 79 term infants recorded in a neonatal intensive care unit (112 h of 18-channel recording). The network was trained using 10 fold cross validation in Matlab. Artefact types included: device interference, EMG, movement, electrode pop, and non-cortical biological rhythms. Performance was assessed by prediction statistics and further validated on a separate independent dataset of 13 term infants (143 h of 3-channel recording). EEG pre-processing steps, and other post-processing steps such as averaging probability over a temporal window, were also included in the algorithm. Results: The Residual Deep Neural Network showed high accuracy (95%) when distinguishing periods of clean, artefact-free EEG from any kind of artefact, with a median accuracy for individual patient of 91% (IQR: 81%-96%). The accuracy in identifying the five different types of artefacts ranged from 57%-92%, with electrode pop being the hardest to detect and EMG being the easiest. This reflected the proportion of artefact available in the training dataset. Misclassification as clean was low for each artefact type, ranging from 1%-11%. The detection accuracy was lower on the validation set (87%). We used the algorithm to show that EEG channels located near the vertex were the least susceptible to artefact. Conclusion: Artefacts can be accurately and reliably identified in the neonatal EEG using a deep learning algorithm. Artefact detection algorithms can provide continuous bedside quality assessment and support EEG review by clinicians or analysis algorithms.</description>

	<description>The response of a neuronal population to a stimulus can be summarized by a vector in a high-dimensional space. Learning theory suggests that the brain should be most able to produce distinct behavioral responses to two stimuli when the rate vectors they evoke are close to orthogonal. To investigate how learning modifies population codes, we measured the orientation tuning of 4,000-neuron populations in visual cortex before and after training on a visual discrimination task. Learning suppressed responses to the task-informative stimuli, most strongly amongst weakly-tuned neurons. This suppression reflected a simple change at the population level: sparsening of population responses to relevant stimuli, resulting in orthogonalization of their rate vectors. A model of F-I curve modulation, requiring no synaptic plasticity, quantitatively predicted the learning effect.</description>

	<description>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are widely expressed in neurons in the central nervous system. It has been documented that HCN channels regulate the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Here, we report that HCN channels limited GABAergic transmission onto pyramidal cells in the mPFC. Pharmacological block of HCN channels resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in mPFC pyramidal cells. Such facilitation effect on mIPSCs required presynaptic Ca2+ influx and reversed by high-dose cAMP. Such facilitation did not exist in the presence of the T-type Ca2+ channel selective blockers. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that HCN channels expressed in presynaptic GABAergic terminals, as well as in both soma and neurite of parvalbumin-expressing (PV-expressing) basket cells in the mPFC. The present results indicate that HCN channels in GABAergic interneurons, most likely PV-expressing basket cells, constrain inhibitory control over layer 5-6 pyramidal cells through restricting presynaptic Ca2+ entry.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Alpha oscillatory activity causally linked to working memory retention: insights from online phase-locking closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)</title>

	<description>Although previous studies have reported correlations between alpha oscillations and the &quot;retention&quot; sub-process of working memory (WM), no direct causal evidence has been established in human neuroscience. Here, we developed an online phase-locking closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) system capable of precisely controlling the phase difference between tACS and concurrent endogenous oscillations. This system permits both up- and down-regulation of brain oscillations at the target stimulation frequency, and is here applied to empirically demonstrate that parietal alpha oscillations causally relate to WM retention. Our experimental design included both in-phase and anti-phase alpha-tACS applied to 39 participants during the retention intervals of a modified Sternberg paradigm. Compared to in-phase alpha-tACS, anti-phase alpha-tACS decreased both WM performance and alpha activity. Moreover, the in-phase tACS-induced changes in WM performance were positively correlated with alpha oscillatory activity. These findings strongly support a causal link between alpha oscillations and WM retention, and illustrate the broad application prospects of phase-locking tACS.</description>

	<description>Reading words aloud is a foundational aspect of the acquisition of literacy. The rapid rate at which multiple distributed neural substrates are engaged in this process can only be probed via techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution. We used direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort to create a holistic yet fine-grained map of word processing, enabling us to derive the spatiotemporal neural codes of multiple word attributes critical to reading: lexicality, word frequency and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded by early activity in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex and precentral sulcus. Word frequency is also first represented in mFus followed by later engagement of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), and orthographic neighborhood is encoded solely in the IPS. A lexicality decoder revealed high weightings for electrodes in the mFus, IPS, anterior IFG and the pre-central sulcus. These results elaborate the neural codes underpinning extant dual-route models of reading, with parallel processing via the lexical route, progressing from mFus to IFG, and the sub-lexical route, progressing from IPS to anterior IFG.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: 3D-MASNet: 3D Mixed-scale Asymmetric Convolutional Segmentation Network for 6-month-old Infant Brain MR Images</title>

	<description>Precise segmentation of infant brain MR images into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for studying neuroanatomical hallmarks of early brain development. However, for 6-month-old infants, the extremely low-intensity contrast caused by inherent myelination hinders accurate tissue segmentation. Existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation model for this task generally employ single-scale symmetric convolutions, which are inefficient for encoding the isointense tissue boundaries in limited samples of baby brain images. Here, we propose a 3D mixed-scale asymmetric convolutional segmentation network (3D-MASNet) framework for brain MR images of 6-month-old infant. We replaced the traditional convolutional layer of an existing to-be-trained network with a 3D mixed-scale convolution block consisting of asymmetric kernels (MixACB) during the training phase and then equivalently converted it into the original network. Five canonical CNN segmentation models were evaluated using both T1- and T2-weighted images of 23 6-month-old infants from iSeg-2019 datasets, which contained manual labels as ground truth. MixACB significantly enhanced the average accuracy of all five models and obtained the largest improvement in the fully convolutional network model (CC-3D-FCN) and the highest performance in the Dense U-Net model. This approach further obtained Dice coefficient accuracies of 0.931, 0.912, and 0.961 in GM, WM, and CSF, respectively, ranking first among 30 teams on the validation dataset of the iSeg-2019 Grand Challenge. Thus, the proposed 3D-MASNet can improve the accuracy of existing CNNs-based segmentation models as a plug-and-play solution that offers a promising technique for future infant brain MRI studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: DNA Methyltransferase 1 and 3a Expression in the Frontal Cortex Regulates Palatable Food Consumption</title>

	<description>DNA methylation is an important regulatory mechanism in the control of neuronal function. Both during development and following exposure to salient stimuli, plasticity in the methylation of cytosine residues leads to a change in neuron excitability that subsequently sculpts animal behavior. However, although the response of DNA methyltransferase enzymes in adult neurons to stimuli such as drugs of abuse have been described, less is known about how these enzymes regulate methylation at specific loci to change the drive to ingest natural rewards. Specifically, we do not understand how changes in methylation within important brain areas known to regulate palatable food intake can affect ingestion, while a detailed investigation of the neurophysiological and genomic effects of perturbing methyltransferase function has not been pursued. By deleting DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a in the mouse prefrontal cortex, we observed the requirement for these enzymes in the regulation of nutrient rich food consumption in the absence of any effect on the intake of low fat and low sugar chow. We also determined that the deletion profoundly affected neuron excitability within pyramidal cells resident in superficial layers II/III of the cortex but had little effect in deep layer V neurons. Finally, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed both hypo and hypermethylation in response to methyltransferase deletion, an effect that was observed in binding sites for retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR{beta}) located within regulatory regions of genes known to affect neuronal function. Together, our data suggest that alterations in the actions of RAR{beta} could shift neuronal activity to reduce palatable food intake.</description>

	<description>The human connectome is the set of physical pathways linking brain regions to one another. Empirical and in silico studies have demonstrated that the structure of this network helps shape patterns of functional coupling between brain regions. To better understand this link between structure and function, a growing number of studies have derived geometric, dynamic, and topological predictors from structural connectivity in order to make predictions about correlation structure. These studies, however, have typically focused on global (whole-brain) predictions using a restricted set of predictors. Here, we investigate a wide range of predictors and shift focus onto predictions of local (regional) patterns of functional coupling. We show that, globally, no individual predictor performs well and, that even the best predictors are largely driven by their ability to predict functional coupling between directly connected regions. We then use the same predictors to make predictions of local coupling and find marked improvement. Notably, the most predictable local FC is linked to sensorimotor regions, which are best predicted by measures based on topological similarity, mean first passage times of random walkers, and the brain's embedding in Euclidean space. We then show that by combining the predictive power of more than one predictor using multi-linear models, we can further improve local predictions. Finally, we investigate how global and local structure-function coupling changes across the human lifespan. We find that, globally, the magnitude of coupling decreases with biological age, which is paralleled by an increase in the number of multi-step pathways. We also show that, locally, structure function coupling is preserved in higher order cognitive systems, but preferentially decreases with age in sensorimotor systems. Our results illuminate the heterogeneous landscape of structure-function coupling across the cerebral cortex and help clarify its changes with age.</description>

	<description>Spin-echo (SE) BOLD fMRI has high microvascular specificity, but its most common acquisition method, SE-EPI, suffers from T2' contrast contamination with undesirable draining vein bias. To address this, in this study, we extended a recently developed multi-shot EPI technique, Echo-Planar Time-resolved Imaging (EPTI), to laminar SE-fMRI at 7T to obtain pure spin-echo BOLD contrast with minimal T2' contamination for improved specificity. We also developed a framework to simultaneously obtain a series of asymmetric SE (ASE) images with varying T2' weightings, and extracted from the same data equivalent conventional SE multi-shot EPI images with different ETLs, to investigate the T2'-induced macrovascular contribution across the spin-echo readout. A low-rank spatiotemporal subspace reconstruction was implemented for the SE-EPTI acquisition, which incorporates corrections for both shot-to-shot phase variations and dynamic B0 drifts. SE-EPTI was used in a visual task fMRI experiment to demonstrate that i) the pure SE image provided by EPTI results in the highest microvascular specificity; ii) the ASE EPTI image series, with a graded introduction of T2' weightings at time points farther away from the pure SE, show a gradual sensitivity increase accompanied by a larger and larger draining vein bias; iii) a longer ETL in the conventional SE EPI acquisition will induce more draining vein bias. Consistent results were observed across multiple subjects, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed technique for SE-BOLD fMRI with high specificity.</description>

	<description>Approaches to control basal ganglia neural activity in real-time are needed to clarify the causal role of 8-35 Hz (&quot;beta band&quot;) oscillatory dynamics in the manifestation of Parkinsons disease (PD) motor signs. Here, we show that resonant beta oscillations evoked by electrical stimulation with precise amplitude and timing can be used to predictably suppress or amplify spontaneous beta band activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in the human. Using this approach, referred to as closed-loop evoked interference deep brain stimulation (eiDBS), we could suppress or amplify frequency-specific (16-22 Hz) neural activity in a PD patient. Amplification of targeted oscillations led to an increase in the variance of movement tracking delays, supporting the hypothesis that pallidal beta oscillations are linked to motor performance. Our results highlight the utility of eiDBS to characterize the pathophysiology of PD and other brain conditions in the human and develop personalized neuromodulation therapies.</description>

	<description>Inverted encoding models have recently become popular as a method for decoding stimuli and investigating neural representations. Here we present a novel modification to inverted encoding models that improves the flexibility and interpretability of stimulus reconstructions, addresses some key issues inherent in the standard inverted encoding model procedure, and provides trial-by-trial stimulus predictions and goodness-of-fit estimates. The standard inverted encoding model approach estimates channel responses (or &quot;reconstructions&quot;), which are averaged and aligned across trials and then typically evaluated using a metric such as slope, amplitude, etc. We discuss how this standard procedure can produce spurious results and other interpretation issues. Our modifications are not susceptible to these methodological issues and are further advantageous due to our decoding metric taking into account the choice of population-level tuning functions and employing a prediction error-based metric directly comparable across experiments. Our modifications also allow researchers to obtain trial-by-trial confidence estimates independent of prediction error which can be used to threshold reconstructions and increase statistical power. We validate and demonstrate the improved utility of our modified inverted encoding model procedure across three real fMRI datasets, and additionally offer a Python package for easy implementation of our approach.</description>

	<description>Dynamic properties of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) provide rich information on brainbehavior relationships. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has been used as a method to characterize FC dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether dynamic modes (DMs), spatial-temporal coherent patterns computed by DMD, provide information about individual behavioral differences. This study established a methodological approach to predict individual differences in behavior using DMs. Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of DMs within each of seven specific frequency bands (0-0.1,...,0.6-0.7 Hz) for prediction. To validate our approach, we confirmed whether each of 59 behavioral measures could be predicted by performing multivariate pattern analysis on a gram matrix, which was created using subject-specific DMs computed from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of individuals. The prediction was successful, and DMD outperformed temporal independent component analysis, a conventional data decomposition method for extracting spatial activity patterns. Most of the behavioral measures that showed significant prediction accuracies in a permutation test were cognitive-behavioral measures. Our results suggested that DMs within frequency bands &amp;lt;0.2 Hz primarily contributed to prediction. In addition, we found that DMs &amp;lt;0.2 Hz had spatial structures similar to several common resting-state networks. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DMs, indicating that DMD is a key approach for extracting spatiotemporal features from rs-fMRI data.</description>

We used superimposed pairs of objects and asked participants to attend to different targets. Modeling voxel responses, we demonstrated that the normalization model outperforms other models in predicting voxel responses in the presence of attention. Our results propose normalization as a canonical computation operating in the primate brain.</description>

	<description>The respective roles of the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) in modulating social cognition and for therapeutic intervention in autism spectrum disorder have not been fully established. In particular, while numerous studies have demonstrated effects of oxytocin in promoting social attention the role of AVP has not been examined. The present study employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled between-subject design to explore the social- and emotion-specific effects of AVP on both bottom-up and topdown attention processing with a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm in 80 male subjects (PLC = 40, AVP = 40). Our findings showed that AVP increased the error rate for social (angry, fearful, happy, neutral and sad faces) but not non-social (oval shapes) stimuli during the anti-saccade condition and reduced error rates in the pro-saccade condition. Comparison of these findings with a previous study (sample size: PLC = 33, OXT = 33) using intranasal oxytocin revealed similar effects of the two peptides on anti-saccade errors but a significantly greater effect of AVP on pro-saccades. Both peptides also produced a post-task anxiolytic effect by reducing state anxiety. Together these findings suggested that both AVP and OXT decrease goal-directed top-down attention control to social salient stimuli but that AVP more potently increased bottom-up social attentional processing.</description>

	<description>During vertebrate central nervous system development, most oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are specified in the ventral spinal cord and must migrate throughout the neural tube until they become evenly distributed, occupying non-overlapping domains. While this process of developmental OPC migration is well characterized, the nature of the molecular mediators that govern it remain largely unknown. Here, using zebrafish as a model, we demonstrate that Met signaling is required for initial developmental migration of OPCs, and, using cell-specific knock-down of Met signaling, show that Met acts cell-autonomously in OPCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate in vivo, the role of Met signaling in OPC migration and provide new insight into how OPC migration is regulated during development.</description>

	<description>Detection of somatosensory inputs requires conversion of external stimuli into electrical signals by activation of primary sensory neurons. The mechanisms by which heterogeneous primary sensory neurons encode different somatosensory inputs remains unclear. In vivo dorsal root ganglia (DRG) imaging using genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) is currently the best technique for this purpose by providing an unprecedented spatial and populational resolution. It permits the simultaneous imaging of &amp;gt;1800 neurons/DRG in live mice. However, this approach is not ideal given that Ca2+ is a second messenger and has inherently slow response kinetics. In contrast, genetically-encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have the potential to track voltage changes in multiple neurons in real time but often lack the brightness and dynamic range required for in vivo use. Here, we used soma-targeted ASAP4, a novel GEVI, to dissect the temporal dynamics of noxious and non-noxious neuronal signals during mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimulation in DRG of live mice. ASAP4 is sufficiently bright and fast enough to optically characterize individual neuron coding dynamics. Notably, using ASAP4, we uncovered cell-to-cell electrical synchronization between adjacent DRG neurons and robust dynamic transformations in sensory coding following tissue injury. Finally, we found that a combination of GEVI and GECI imaging empowered in vivo optical studies of sensory signal processing and integration mechanisms with optimal spatiotemporal analysis.</description>

	<description>Rehabilitation from alcohol addiction or abuse is challenging due to alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Headache is a severe alcohol withdrawal symptom that frequently contributes to rehabilitation failure. Despite the need for treating alcohol withdrawal-induced headache, there is no appropriate therapeutic option available. Development of improved therapeutics will depend on obtaining a clearer understanding of alcohol withdrawal-induced headache pain mechanisms. Here, we show that the mast cell-specific receptor MrgprB2 controls development of alcohol withdrawal-induced headache. Withdrawing alcohol from alcohol-acclimated mice induces strong headache behaviors, including facial allodynia, facial pain expressions, and reduced walking movement, symptoms often observed in humans suffering from headache. Observed pain behaviors were abolished in MrgprB2-deficient mice. We observed in vivo spontaneous activation and hypersensitization of trigeminal ganglia neurons in alcohol withdrawal mice, but not in MrgprB2-deficient mice. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was increased in dura mater after alcohol withdrawal. Injection of CRF into dura mater resulted in activation of trigeminal ganglia neurons and vasodilation, which was accompanied by headache behavior. In cells, CRF evoked Ca2+ transients via MrgprB2 or human MrgprX2. The results indicate that alcohol withdrawal causes headache via mast cell degranulation in dura mater. The process is under control of MrgprB2/MrgprX2, which would appear to represent a potential target for treating alcohol withdrawal-related headache.</description>

	<description>After surgeries, especially thoracotomy incision, patients develop unbearable pain. Opioids are used for reducing pain but often cause serious side effects. Previously, we found that capsaicin pretreatment of the incision area alleviated spontaneous and thermal pain in a postoperative pain animal model. In the present study, we aimed to monitor primary sensory neuron Ca2+ activity in in vivo dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a postoperative pain model using Pirt-GCaMP3 treated with capsaicin or controls. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin (0.05%) alleviated spontaneous, mechanical, and thermal postoperative pain. The Ca2+ response in in vivo DRG and in in situ spinal cord was significantly enhanced in the ipsilateral side compared to contralateral side or naive control. Primary sensory nerve fiber length was significantly decreased in the incision skin area in capsaicin-pretreated animals detected by immunohistochemistry and placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) staining. Thus, capsaicin pretreatment alleviates postoperative pain by suppressing Ca2+ response due to degeneration of primary sensory nerve fibers in the skin.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Meclizine and metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists attenuate severe pain and primary sensory neuron Ca2+ activity in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy</title>

	<description>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects about 68% of patients undergoing chemotherapy and causes severe neuropathic pain which is debilitating health problem and greatly reduces quality of life. Cisplatin is a commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug known to cause CIPN, possibly by causing oxidative stress damage to primary sensory neurons. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are widely hypothesized to be involved in pain processing. Meclizine is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist which is known to have neuroprotective effects including anti-oxidative effect. Here, we used a mouse model of cisplatin-induced CIPN to test agonists of mGluR8 and group II mGluR as well as meclizine as interventions to reduce cisplatin-induced pain. We performed behavioral pain tests and in vivo entire DRG neurons Ca2+ imaging using genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicator, Pirt-GCaMP3 to monitor different drug interventions on a populational ensemble level. CIPN induced increased spontaneous Ca2+ activity in DRG neurons, increased Ca2+ transient amplitudes, and hyperresponses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. We found mGluR8 agonist, DCPG, group II mGluR agonist, LY379268, and Histamine1 receptor antagonist, meclizine all significantly attenuated mechanical and thermal pain caused by CIPN. LY379268 and meclizine, but not DCPG, attenuated DRG neuronal Ca2+ activity elevated by CIPN. Furthermore, meclizine attenuated cisplatin-induced weight loss. These results suggest group II mGluR agonist, mGluR8 agonist, and meclizine are excellent candidates to study for mechanisms and new treatment option for CIPN.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Coordinated regulation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors and anandamide metabolism stabilize network activity during homeostatic scaling down</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.21.445170v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neurons express overlapping homeostatic mechanisms to regulate synaptic function and network properties in response to perturbations of neuronal activity. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are bioactive lipids synthesized in the post-synaptic compartments that regulate synaptic transmission, plasticity, and neuronal excitability throughout much of the brain, by activating pre-synaptic cannabinoid receptor CB1. The eCB system is well situated to regulate neuronal network properties and coordinate pre- and post-synaptic activity. However, the role of the eCB system in homeostatic adaptations to neuronal hyperactivity is unknown. We show that in mature cultured rat cortical neurons, chronic bicuculline treatment, known to induce homeostatic scaling-down, induces a coordinated adaptation to enhance tonic eCB signaling. Hyperexcitation triggers down regulation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the lipase that degrades the eCB anandamide. Subsequently, we measured an accumulation of anandamide and related metabolites, and an upregulation of total and cell surface CB1. We show that bicuculline induced downregulation of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors and upregulation of CB1 occur through independent mechanisms. Finally, using live-cell microscopy of neurons expressing an extracellular fluorescent glutamate reporter (iGluSnFR), we confirm that cortical neurons in vitro exhibit highly synchronized network activity, reminiscent of cortical up-states in vivo. Up-state like activity in mature cortical cultures requires CB1 signaling under both control conditions and following chronic bicuculline treatment. We propose that during the adaptation to chronic neuronal hyperexcitation, tonic eCB signaling is enhanced through coordinated changes in anandamide metabolism and cell-surface CB1 expression to maintain synchronous network activity.

Significance statementNeurons are remarkably resilient to perturbations in network activities thanks to the expression of overlapping homeostatic adaptations. In response to network hyperactivity or silencing, neurons can respond through changes in excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors, probability of pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release, or changes in membrane excitability. The endocannabinoid system is a prominent signaling pathway at many synapses that is known to be involved in multiple forms of short and long-term synaptic plasticity. Here we find that components of the endocannabinoid system are upregulated in response to chronic hyperexcitation of cultured cortical neurons, and that endocannabinoid signaling is required to maintain synchronized network activity. This work supports a novel tonic homeostatic function for the endocannabinoid system in neurons.</description>

	<description>To interpret in vivo experiments designed to understand brain function, high-resolution whole-brain microscopy provides a means for post hoc determination of the location of implanted devices and recorded cells in three dimensional brain space that is a critical step for data interrogation. Here we have developed Python-based tools (brainreg and brainreg-segment) to accurately map, in a common coordinate space, the position of dye-labelled probe tracks and two-photon imaged cell populations expressing fluorescent protein. The precise location of probes and cells were validated using physiological recordings and human raters that indicate accuracy levels to less than 70{micro}m. These flexible, open-source methodologies are expected to further evolve with need and to deliver the anatomical precision that is necessary for understanding the functional architecture of the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Afferent connections of cytoarchitectural area 6M and surrounding cortex in the marmoset: putative homologues of the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas</title>

	<description>Cortical projections to the caudomedial frontal cortex were studied using retrograde tracers in marmosets. We tested the hypothesis that cytoarchitectural area 6M includes homologues of the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas (SMA and preSMA) of other primates. We found that, irrespective of the injection sites location within 6M, over half of the labeled neurons were located in motor and premotor areas. Other connections originated in prefrontal area 8b, ventral anterior and posterior cingulate areas, somatosensory areas (3a and 1-2), and areas on the rostral aspect of the dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Although the origin of afferents was similar, injections in rostral 6M received higher percentages of prefrontal afferents, and fewer somatosensory afferents, compared to caudal injections, compatible with differentiation into SMA and preSMA. Injections rostral to 6M (area 8b) revealed a very different set of connections, with increased emphasis in prefrontal and posterior cingulate afferents, and fewer parietal afferents. The connections of 6M were also quantitatively different from those of M1, dorsal premotor areas, and cingulate motor area 24d. These results show that the cortical motor control circuit is conserved in simian primates, indicating that marmosets can be valuable models for studying movement planning and control.</description>

	<description>Working memory training improves cognitive performance on untrained tasks; however, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms, particularly in childhood where neuroplasticity may be greatest. The neural correlates of working memory training were investigated in 32 typically developing children aged 10-14 years (19 girls and 13 boys; Devon, UK) using a randomised controlled design and multi-modal MRI. Training improved working memory performance and increased intrinsic functional connectivity within the dorsal attention network. Furthermore, improvements in working memory were associated with greater recruitment of the left middle frontal gyrus during a complex span task. The repeated engagement of fronto-parietal regions during training may increase their activity and functional connectivity over time, affording greater attentional control on working memory tasks.</description>

	<description>The medial frontal cortex (MFC), especially its ventral part, has long been of great interest with respect to the pathology of mood disorders. A number of human brain imaging studies have demonstrated the abnormalities of this brain region in patients with mood disorders, however, whether it is critically involved in the pathogenesis of such disorders remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we conducted a causal study to investigate how the suppression of neural activity in the ventral region of the MFC (vMFC) affects the behavioral and physiological states of monkeys by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). By using low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) as an inhibitory intervention, we found that LF-rTMS targeting the vMFC induced a depression-like state in monkeys, which was characterized by a reduced spontaneous behavioral activity, increased plasma cortisol level, impaired sociability, and decreased motivation level. On the other hand, no such significant changes in behavioral and physiological states were observed when targeting the other MFC regions, dorsal or posterior. We further found that the administration of an antidepressant agent, ketamine, ameliorated the abnormal behavioral and physiological states induced by the LF-rTMS intervention. These findings indicate the causal involvement of the vMFC in the regulation of mood and affect and the validity of the LF-rTMS-induced dysfunction of the vMFC as a nonhuman primate model of the depression-like state.</description>

	<description>Infant electroencephalography (EEG) presents several challenges compared with adult data. Recordings are typically short. Motion artifacts heavily contaminate the data. The EEG neural signal and the artifacts change throughout development. Traditional data preprocessing pipelines have been developed mainly for event-related potentials analyses, and they required manual steps, or use fixed thresholds for rejecting epochs. However, larger datasets make the use of manual steps infeasible, and new analytical approaches may have different preprocessing requirements. Here we propose an Automated Pipeline for Infants Continuous EEG (APICE). APICE is fully automated, flexible, and modular. Artifacts are detected using multiple algorithms and adaptive thresholds, making it suitable to different age groups and testing procedures without redefining parameters. Artifacts detection and correction of transient artifacts is performed on continuous data, allowing for better data recovery and providing flexibility (i.e., the same preprocessing is usable for different analyses). Here we describe APICE and validate it using two infant datasets of different ages tested in different experimental paradigms. We also tested the combination of APICE with common data cleaning methods such as Independent Component Analysis and Denoising Source Separation. APICE uses EEGLAB and compatible custom functions. It is freely available at https://github.com/neurokidslab/eeg_preprocessing, together with example scripts.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Bimanual digit training improves right-hand dexterity in older adults by reactivating declined ipsilateral motor-cortical inhibition</title>

	<description>Improving deteriorated sensorimotor functions in older individuals is a social necessity in a super aging society. Previous studies suggested that the declined interhemispheric sensorimotor inhibition observed in older adults is associated with their deteriorated hand/finger dexterity. Here, we examined whether bimanual digit exercises, which can train the interhemispheric inhibitory system, improve deteriorated hand/finger dexterity in older adults. Forty-eight healthy, right-handed, older adults (65-78 years old) were divided into two groups, i.e., the bimanual (BM) digit training and right-hand (RH) training groups, and intensive daily training was performed for 2 months. Before and after the training, we evaluated individual right hand/finger dexterity using a peg task, and the individual state of interhemispheric sensorimotor inhibition by analyzing ipsilateral sensorimotor deactivation via functional magnetic resonance imaging when participants experienced a kinesthetic illusory movement of the right-hand without performing any motor tasks. Before training, the degree of reduction/loss of ipsilateral motor-cortical deactivation was associated with dexterity deterioration. After training, the dexterity improved only in the BM group, and the dexterity improvement was correlated with reduction in ipsilateral motor-cortical activity. The capability of the brain to inhibit ipsilateral motor-cortical activity during a simple right-hand sensory-motor task is tightly related to right-hand dexterity in older adults.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The role of the hippocampus in recognition memory has long been a source of debate. Tasks used to study recognition that typically require an explicit probe, where the participant must make a response to prove they remember, yield mixed results on hippocampal involvement. Here, we tasked monkeys to freely view naturalistic videos, and only tested their memory via looking times for two separate novel versus repeat video conditions on each trial. Notably, a large proportion (&amp;gt;30%) of hippocampal neurons differentiated these videos via changes in firing rates time‐locked to the duration of their presentation on screen, and not during the delay period between them as would be expected for working memory. Many of these single neurons (&amp;gt;15%) contributed to both retrieval conditions, and differentiated novel from repeat videos across trials with trial‐unique content, suggesting they detect familiarity. The majority of neurons contributing to the classifier showed an enhancement in firing rate on repeat compared with novel videos, a pattern which has not previously been shown in hippocampus. These results suggest the hippocampus contributes to recognition memory via familiarity during free‐viewing.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut microbiome signatures of risk and prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26128</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26128?af=R</link>
	<description>Objectives
Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.


Methods
Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α−/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants.


Results
Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Amongst other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes‐enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the Bacteroides‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the Prevotella‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.


Interpretation
Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The phonological loop is part of Baddeley’s verbal working memory (VWM) model that stores phonological information and refreshes its contents through an articulatory process. Many studies have reported the cerebellum’s involvement during VWM tasks. In the motor literature, the cerebellum is thought to support smooth and rapid movement sequences through internal models that simulate the action of motor commands, then use the error signals generating from the discrepancy between the predicted and actual sensory consequences to adjust the motor system. Here, we hypothesize that a similar monitoring and error-driven adjustment process can be extended to VWM; specifically, the cerebellum checks for discrepancies between the predicted and actual articulatory process to ensure the accuracy and fluency of articulatory rehearsal. During neuroimaging, participants rehearsed a sequence of letters in sync with the presentation of a visual pacing stimulus (#) that was terminated by the occurrence of a probe letter. Participants judged whether the probe was the correct letter in the sequence (i.e., match trial), or deviated from the sequence (i.e., mismatch trial). Detection of sequence violation was not only associated with prolonged reaction time but also an increased activation in a left executive control network. Psychophysiological interaction was used to investigate whether the cerebellum interacts with the cerebral cortex for error monitoring and adjustments. We found increased functional connectivity between the right cerebellum and the cerebral cortex during mismatch relative to match probes, indicating sequence violation resulting in greater cerebellar connectivity with areas in the cerebral cortex involved in phonological sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Molecular fluctuations can lead to macroscopically observable effects. The random gating of ion channels in the membrane of a nerve cell provides an important example. The contributions of independent noise sources to the variability of action potential timing have not previously been studied at the level of molecular transitions within a conductance-based model ion-state graph. Here we study a stochastic Langevin model for the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) system based on a detailed representation of the underlying channel state Markov process, the “&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(14\times 28\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt;D model” introduced in (Pu and Thomas in Neural Computation 32(10):1775–1835, 2020). We show how to resolve the individual contributions that each transition in the ion channel graph makes to the variance of the interspike interval (ISI). We extend the mean return time (MRT) phase reduction developed in (Cao et al. in SIAM J Appl Math 80(1):422–447, 2020) to the second moment of the return time from an MRT isochron to itself. Because fixed-voltage spike detection triggers do not correspond to MRT isochrons, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;inter-phase interval&lt;/em&gt; (IPI) variance only approximates the ISI variance. We find the IPI variance and ISI variance agree to within a few percent when both can be computed. Moreover, we prove rigorously, and show numerically, that our expression for the IPI variance is accurate in the small noise (large system size) regime; our theory is exact in the limit of small noise. By selectively including the noise associated with only those few transitions responsible for most of the ISI variance, our analysis extends the stochastic shielding (SS) paradigm (Schmandt and Galán in Phys Rev Lett 109(11):118101, 2012) from the stationary voltage clamp case to the current clamp case. We show numerically that the SS approximation has a high degree of accuracy even for larger, physiologically relevant noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that the ISI variance is not an unambiguously defined quantity, but depends on the choice of voltage level set as the spike detection threshold. We find a small but significant increase in ISI variance, the higher the spike detection voltage, both for simulated stochastic HH data and for voltage traces recorded in in vitro experiments. In contrast, the IPI variance is invariant with respect to the choice of isochron used as a trigger for counting “spikes.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills were both related to neurocognitive functioning and white matter microstructure. No evidence was found for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in the relationship between both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning.

Abstract
Recent evidence indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance are related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children by influencing brain structure and functioning. This study investigates the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in healthy children. In total 92 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 8.0–10.7) were included in this study. Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance were assessed using performance‐based tests. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tests (working memory, inhibition, interference control, information processing, and attention). Diffusion tensor imaging was used in combination with tract‐based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure as defined by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD). The results revealed positive associations of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. Information processing and motor response inhibition were associated with FA in a cluster located in the corpus callosum. Within this cluster, higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were both associated with greater FA, greater AD, and lower RD. No mediating role was found for FA in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. The results indicate that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning as well as white matter microstructure in children. However, this study provides no evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in these relationships.</description>

Interest in gene drive technology has continued to grow as promising new drive systems have been developed in the lab and discussions are moving towards implementing field trials. The prospect of field trials requires models that incorporate a significant degree of ecological detail, including parameters that change over time in response to environmental data such as temperature and rainfall, leading to seasonal patterns in mosquito population density. Epidemiological outcomes are also of growing importance, as: i) the suitability of a gene drive construct for release will depend on its expected impact on disease transmission, and ii) initial field trials are expected to have a measured entomological outcome and a modeled epidemiological outcome. We present MGDrivE 2 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2): a significant development from the MGDrivE 1 simulation framework that investigates the population dynamics of a variety of gene drive architectures and their spread through spatially-explicit mosquito populations. Key strengths and fundamental improvements of the MGDrivE 2 framework are: i) the ability of parameters to vary with time and induce seasonal population dynamics, ii) an epidemiological module accommodating reciprocal pathogen transmission between humans and mosquitoes, and iii) an implementation framework based on stochastic Petri nets that enables efficient model formulation and flexible implementation. Example MGDrivE 2 simulations are presented to demonstrate the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based split gene drive system intended to drive a disease-refractory gene into a population in a confinable and reversible manner, incorporating time-varying temperature and rainfall data. The simulations also evaluate impact on human disease incidence and prevalence. Further documentation and use examples are provided in vignettes at the project’s CRAN repository. MGDrivE 2 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MGDrivE2). We intend the package to provide a flexible tool capable of modeling gene drive constructs as they move closer to field application and to infer their expected impact on disease transmission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ilj39Jhio9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genetic predisposition for complex traits often acts through multiple tissues at different time points during development. As a simple example, the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested either through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain, or that control fat storage through dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue, or both. Here we describe a statistical approach that leverages tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) corresponding to tissue-specific genes to prioritize a relevant tissue underlying the genetic predisposition of a given individual for a complex trait. Unlike existing approaches that prioritize relevant tissues for the trait in the population, our approach probabilistically quantifies the tissue-wise genetic contribution to the trait for a given individual. We hypothesize that for a subgroup of individuals the genetic contribution to the trait can be mediated primarily through a specific tissue. Through simulations using the UK Biobank, we show that our approach can predict the relevant tissue accurately and can cluster individuals according to their tissue-specific genetic architecture. We analyze body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) in the UK Biobank to identify subgroups of individuals whose genetic predisposition act primarily through brain versus adipose tissue, and adipose versus muscle tissue, respectively. Notably, we find that these individuals have specific phenotypic features beyond BMI and WHRadjBMI that distinguish them from random individuals in the data, suggesting biological effects of tissue-specific genetic contribution for these traits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/702WWWjDJ6w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
Object naming involves accessing meaning and retrieving the associated word form from remote semantic memory. Historically, previously acquired semantic knowledge (i.e., remote semantic memory) was thought to be independent of the hippocampus via neocortical consolidation. This view is based on evidence demonstrating a dissociation in behavior in patients with hippocampal amnesia: amnesic patients are impaired in acquiring new vocabulary yet can name and define previously acquired words. More recently, the view that remote semantic memory is hippocampus‐independent has been challenged by the documentation of disruptions in aspects of remote semantic memory in patients with hippocampal amnesia, particularly in language use and depth of semantic knowledge. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the hippocampus plays a long‐term role in remote semantic memory. We tested amnesic patients and demographically matched healthy comparison participants in an extensive naming task using photographic images of objects normalized for familiarity, object agreement, and visual complexity. Amnesic patients were less likely to correctly name objects than healthy comparison participants. Further, amnesic patients' performance worsened for words that were less familiar, more visually complex, and had less object agreement. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may play a long‐term role in semantic memory processes, rather than a time‐limited role in the initial acquisition of semantic information, and that hippocampal damage can disrupt object naming.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neurons including hippocampal spatial view cells, and navigation in primates including humans</title>

	<description>Abstract
A new theory is proposed of mechanisms of navigation in primates including humans in which spatial view cells found in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus are used to guide the individual from landmark to landmark. The navigation involves approach to each landmark in turn (taxis), using spatial view cells to identify the next landmark in the sequence, and does not require a topological map. Two other cell types found in primates, whole body motion cells, and head direction cells, can be utilized in the spatial view cell navigational mechanism, but are not essential. If the landmarks become obscured, then the spatial view representations can be updated by self‐motion (idiothetic) path integration using spatial coordinate transform mechanisms in the primate dorsal visual system to transform from egocentric to allocentric spatial view coordinates. A continuous attractor network or time cells or working memory is used in this approach to navigation to encode and recall the spatial view sequences involved. I also propose how navigation can be performed using a further type of neuron found in primates, allocentric‐bearing‐to‐a‐landmark neurons, in which changes of direction are made when a landmark reaches a particular allocentric bearing. This is useful if a landmark cannot be approached. The theories are made explicit in models of navigation, which are then illustrated by computer simulations. These types of navigation are contrasted with triangulation, which requires a topological map. It is proposed that the first strategy utilizing spatial view cells is used frequently in humans, and is relatively simple because primates have spatial view neurons that respond allocentrically to locations in spatial scenes. An advantage of this approach to navigation is that hippocampal spatial view neurons are also useful for episodic memory, and for imagery.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) shows neuronal death in cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA3, and CA4. It is known that granule cells and CA2 neurons survive and their axons, the mossy fibers (MF), lose their target cells in CA3 and CA4 and sprout to the granule cell layer and molecular layer. We examined in TLE patients and in a mouse epilepsy model, whether MF sprouting is directed to the dentate gyrus or extends to distant CA regions and whether sprouting is associated with death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4. In 319 TLE patients, HS was evaluated by Wyler grade and International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) types using immunohistochemistry against neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Synaptoporin was used to colocalize MF. In addition, transgenic Thy1‐eGFP mice were intrahippocampally injected with kainate and sprouting of eGFP‐positive MFs was analyzed together with immunocytochemistry for regulator of G‐protein signaling 14 (RGS14). In human HS Wyler III and IV as well as in ILAE 1, 2, and 3 specimens, we found synaptoporin‐positive axon terminals in CA2 and even in CA1, associated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. Sprouting was seen in cases with cell death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4 (classical severe HS ILAE type 1) but also without this cell death (atypical HS ILAE type 2). Similarly, in epileptic mice eGFP‐positive MFs sprouted to CA2 and beyond. The presence of MF terminals in the CA2 pyramidal cell layer and in CA1 was also correlated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. The similarity of our findings in human specimens and in the mouse model highlights the importance and opens up new chances of using translational approaches to determine mechanisms underlying TLE.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Theoretical accounts of moral decision making imply distinct ways in which episodic memory processes may contribute to judgments about moral dilemmas that entail high conflict between a harmful action and a greater good resulting from such action. Yet, studies examining the status of moral judgment in amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions have yielded inconsistent results. To examine whether and how episodic processes contribute to high conflict moral decisions, amnesic patients with MTL damage and control participants were asked to judge the moral acceptability of a harmful action across two conditions that differed in the framing of the moral question. We predicted that personal (but not abstract) framing would engage episodic processes involved in mental simulation, yielding a selective impairment in MTL patients in the personal framing condition. This prediction was not confirmed as neither patients nor controls were influenced by the framing of the moral question. With the exception of a patient whose lesion extended into the amygdala bilaterally, patients were less willing than controls to endorse the utilitarian option, rejecting the harmful action despite its beneficial outcome. They also rated actions as emotionally more intense than did controls. These findings suggest that episodic processes involved in mental simulation are necessary to prospectively evaluate action‐outcome contingencies.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The hippocampal‐entorhinal system represents nested hierarchical relations between words during concept learning</title>

	<description>Abstract
A fundamental skill of an intelligent mind is that of being able to rapidly discover the structural organization underlying the relations across the objects or the events in the world. Humans, thanks to language, master this skill. For example, a child learning that dolphins and cats can also be referred to as mammals, not only will infer the presence of a hierarchical organization for which dolphins and cats are subordinate exemplars of the category mammals, but will also derive that dolphins are, at least at one conceptual level, more similar to cats than to sharks, despite their indisputable higher perceptual similarity to the latter. The hippocampal‐entorhinal system, classically known for its involvement in relational and inferential memory, is a likely candidate to construct and hold these complex relational structures between concepts. To test this hypothesis, we trained healthy human adults to organize a novel audio‐visual object space into categories labeled with novel words. Crucially, a hierarchical taxonomy existed between the object categories, and participants discovered it via inference during a simple associative object‐to‐word training. Using functional MRI after learning, and a combination of ROI‐based multivariate analyses, we found that both the mid‐anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex represented the inferred hierarchical structure between words: subordinate‐level words were represented more similarly to their related superordinate than to unrelated ones. This was paired, in the entorhinal cortex, by an additional signature of internalized structural representation of nested hierarchy: words referring to subordinate concepts belonging to the same superordinate category were represented more similarly compared with those not belonging to the same superordinate level: interestingly, this similarity was never directly taught to subjects nor it was made explicit during the task, but only indirectly derived through a logical inferential process and, crucially, contrasted the evidence coming from the definitional perceptual properties of the concepts. None of these results were observed before learning, when the same words were not yet semantically organized. A whole‐brain searchlight revealed that the effect in the entorhinal cortex extends to a wider network of areas, encompassing the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, partially overlapping with the semantic network.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is evolutionarily conserved as one of the few sites of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Although there is clear evidence that neurogenesis is necessary for healthy hippocampal function, whether adult‐born neurons are simply integrated into existing hippocampal networks to serve a similar purpose to that of developmentally born neurons or whether they represent a discrete cell population with unique functions remains less clear. In this review, we consider evidence for discrete cellular, synaptic, and structural features of adult‐born DG neurons, suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the formation of a heterogeneous DG. We therefore propose that hippocampal neurogenesis creates a specialized neuronal subpopulation that may play a key role in hippocampal functions like episodic memory. We note critical gaps in this extensive body of work, including a general failure to include female animals in relevant research and a need for more precise consideration of intrahippocampal neuroanatomy.</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: PLSM: A Parallelized Liquid State Machine for Unintentional Action Detection. (arXiv:2105.09909v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reservoir Computing (RC) offers a viable option to deploy AI algorithms on
low-end embedded system platforms. Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a bio-inspired
RC model that mimics the cortical microcircuits and uses spiking neural
networks (SNN) that can be directly realized on neuromorphic hardware. In this
paper, we present a novel Parallelized LSM (PLSM) architecture that
incorporates spatio-temporal read-out layer and semantic constraints on model
output. To the best of our knowledge, such a formulation has been done for the
first time in literature, and it offers a computationally lighter alternative
to traditional deep-learning models. Additionally, we also present a
comprehensive algorithm for the implementation of parallelizable SNNs and LSMs
that are GPU-compatible. We implement the PLSM model to classify
unintentional/accidental video clips, using the Oops dataset. From the
experimental results on detecting unintentional action in video, it can be
observed that our proposed model outperforms a self-supervised model and a
fully supervised traditional deep learning model. All the implemented codes can
be found at our repository

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: DEHB: Evolutionary Hyberband for Scalable, Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization. (arXiv:2105.09821v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09821</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09821</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning algorithms crucially rely on several design decisions
to achieve strong performance, making the problem of Hyperparameter
Optimization (HPO) more important than ever. Here, we combine the advantages of
the popular bandit-based HPO method Hyperband (HB) and the evolutionary search
approach of Differential Evolution (DE) to yield a new HPO method which we call
DEHB. Comprehensive results on a very broad range of HPO problems, as well as a
wide range of tabular benchmarks from neural architecture search, demonstrate
that DEHB achieves strong performance far more robustly than all previous HPO
methods we are aware of, especially for high-dimensional problems with discrete
input dimensions. For example, DEHB is up to 1000x faster than random search.
It is also efficient in computational time, conceptually simple and easy to
implement, positioning it well to become a new default HPO method.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Improved Neuronal Ensemble Inference with Generative Model and MCMC. (arXiv:2105.09679v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09679</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09679</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal ensemble inference is a significant problem in the study of
biological neural networks. Various methods have been proposed for ensemble
inference from experimental data of neuronal activity. Among them, Bayesian
inference approach with generative model was proposed recently. However, this
method requires large computational cost for appropriate inference. In this
work, we give an improved Bayesian inference algorithm by modifying update rule
in Markov chain Monte Carlo method and introducing the idea of simulated
annealing for hyperparameter control. We compare the performance of ensemble
inference between our algorithm and the original one, and discuss the advantage
of our method.

In forests, elevated CO2 generally seems to greatly increase plant biomass, but not soil carbon. In grasslands, by contrast, it causes small changes in biomass and large increases in soil carbon.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~4/hHAA4OksvmE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Long-Lasting Event-Related Beta Synchronizations of Electroencephalographic Activity in Response to Support-Surface Perturbations During Upright Stance: A Pilot Study Associating Beta Rebound and Active Monitoring in the Intermittent Postural Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.660434</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Movement related beta band cortical oscillations, including beta rebound after execution and/or suppression of movement, have drawn attention in upper extremity motor control literature. However, fewer studies focused on beta band oscillations during postural control in upright stance. In this preliminary study, we examined beta rebound and other components of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during perturbed upright stance to investigate supraspinal contributions to postural stabilization. Particularly, we aimed to clarify the timing and duration of beta rebound within a non-sustained, but long-lasting postural recovery process that occurs more slowly compared to upper extremities. To this end, EEG signals were acquired from nine healthy young adults in response to a brief support-surface perturbation, together with the center of pressure, the center of mass and electromyogram (EMG) activities of ankle muscles. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations were computed from EEG data using the perturbation-onset as a triggering event. After short-latency (&amp;lt;0.3 s) ERPs, our results showed a decrease in high-beta band oscillations (event-related desynchronization), which was followed by a significant increase (event-related synchronization) in the same band, as well as a decrease in theta band oscillations. Unlike during upper extremity motor tasks, the beta rebound in this case was initiated before the postural recovery was completed, and sustained for as long as 3 s with small EMG responses for the first half period, followed by no excessive EMG activities for the second half period. We speculate that those novel characteristics of beta rebound might be caused by slow postural dynamics along a stable manifold of the unstable saddle-type upright equilibrium of the postural control system without active feedback control, but with active monitoring of the postural state, in the framework of the intermittent control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Complete Correction of Brain and Spinal Cord Pathology in Metachromatic Leukodystrophy Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.677895</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of sulfatides in both glial cells and neurons. MLD results from an inherited deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and myelin degeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Currently, no effective treatment is available for the most frequent late infantile (LI) form of MLD after symptom onset. The LI form results in rapid neurological degradation and early death. ARSA enzyme must be rapidly and efficiently delivered to brain and spinal cord oligodendrocytes of patients with LI MLD in order to potentially stop the progression of the disease. We previously showed that brain gene therapy with adeno-associated virus serotype rh10 (AAVrh10) driving the expression of human ARSA cDNA alleviated most long-term disease manifestations in MLD mice but was not sufficient in MLD patient to improve disease progression. Herein, we evaluated the short-term effects of intravenous AAVPHP.eB delivery driving the expression of human ARSA cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus/b-actin hybrid (CAG) promoter in 6-month-old MLD mice that already show marked sulfatide accumulation and brain pathology. Within 3 months, a single intravenous injection of AAVPHP.eB-hARSA-HA resulted in correction of brain and spinal cord sulfatide storage, and improvement of astrogliosis and microgliosis in brain and spinal cord of treated animals. These results strongly support to consider the use of AAVPHP.eB-hARSA vector for intravenous gene therapy in symptomatic rapidly progressing forms of MLD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: CircRNA-ceRNA Network Revealing the Potential Regulatory Roles of CircRNA in Alzheimer’s Disease Involved the cGMP-PKG Signal Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.665788</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.665788</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. The characteristic pathologies include extracellular senile plaques formed by β-amyloid protein deposition, neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and neuronal loss with glial cell hyperplasia. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are rich in miRNA-binding sites (miRNA response elements, MREs), which serve as miRNA sponges or competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Although several research groups have identified dysregulated circRNAs in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice or APP/PS1 mice using deep RNA-seq analysis, we need to further explore circRNA expression patterns, targets, functions and the signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD and in particular the hippocampal circRNA expression profiles in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used deep RNA sequencing to investigate circRNA-ceRNA network patterns in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In our study, 70 dysregulated circRNAs, 39 dysregulated miRNAs and 121 dysregulated mRNAs were identified between the APP/PS1 group and the wild-type group at 8 months in the hippocampus of the mice. Through correlation analysis, we identified 11 dysregulated circRNAs, 7 dysregulated miRNAs and 8 dysregulated mRNAs forming 16 relationships in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs were most enriched in biological metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the dysregulation of circRNAs was enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, platelet activation, long-term potentiation and axon guidance. In addition, our findings preliminarily verified that the novel_circ_0003012/mmu-miR-298-3p/Smoc2 signaling axis may regulate the pathophysiology of AD by affecting the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These newly identified circRNAs in networks and signaling pathways reveal potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Abnormal Functional Connectivity in the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine System Associated With Anxiety Symptom in Chronic Insomnia Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.678465</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Mental syndromes such as anxiety and depression are common comorbidities in patients with chronic insomnia disorder (CID). The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) system is considered to be crucial for modulation of emotion and sleep/wake cycle. LC-NE system is also a critical mediator of the stress-induced anxiety. However, whether the LC-NE system contributes to the underlying mechanism linking insomnia and these comorbidities remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the LC-NE system alterations in patients with insomnia and its relationship with depression and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventy patients with CID and 63 matched good sleep control (GSC) subjects were recruited and underwent resting-state functional MRI scan. LC-NE functional network was constructed by using seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The alterations in LC-NE FC network in patients with CID and their clinical significance was explored.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with GSC group, the CID group showed decreased left LC-NE FC in the left inferior frontal gyrus, while they had increased LC-NE FC in the left supramarginal gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG). For the right LC-NE FC network, decreased FC was found in left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Interesting, the increased LC-NE FC was located in sensory cortex, while decreased LC-NE FC was located in frontal control cortex. In addition, the FC between the left LC and left MOG was associated with the duration of the disease, while abnormal FC between right LC and left dACC was associated with the anxiety scores in patients with CID.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study found abnormal LC-NE functional network in patients with CID, and the altered LC-NE function in dACC was associated with anxiety symptoms in CID. The present study substantially extended our understanding of the neuropathological basis of CID and provided the potential treatment target for CID patients who also had anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence imaging devices have been indispensable in elucidating the workings of the brain in living animals, including unrestrained, active ones. Various devices are available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of many factors. We have developed CMOS-based needle-type imaging devices that are small and lightweight enough to be doubly implanted in freely moving mice. The design also allowed angled implantations to avoid critical areas. We demonstrated the utility of the devices by using them on GCaMP6 mice in a formalin test experiment. Simultaneous implantations to the capsular-lateral central amygdala (CeLC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were proven to be safe and did not hinder the execution of the study. Analysis of the collected calcium signaling data, supported by behavior data, showed increased activity in both regions as a result of pain stimulation. Thus, we have successfully demonstrated the various advantages of the device in its application in the pain experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Energy-Period Profiles of Brain Networks in Group fMRI Resting-State Data: A Comparison of Empirical Mode Decomposition With the Short-Time Fourier Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663403</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663403</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, functional networks in resting-state data were investigated with linear Fourier and wavelet-related methods to characterize their frequency content by relying on pre-specified frequency bands. In this study, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), an adaptive time-frequency method, is used to investigate the naturally occurring frequency bands of resting-state data obtained by Group Independent Component Analysis. Specifically, energy-period profiles of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) obtained by EMD are created and compared for different resting-state networks. These profiles have a characteristic distribution for many resting-state networks and are related to the frequency content of each network. A comparison with the linear Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) shows that EMD provides a more frequency-adaptive representation of different types of resting-state networks. Clustering of resting-state networks based on the energy-period profiles leads to clusters of resting-state networks that have a monotone relationship with frequency and energy. This relationship is strongest with EMD, intermediate with MODWT, and weakest with STFT. The identification of these relationships suggests that EMD has significant advantages in characterizing brain networks compared to STFT and MODWT. In a clinical application to early Parkinson’s disease (PD) vs. normal controls (NC), energy and period content were studied for several common resting-state networks. Compared to STFT and MODWT, EMD showed the largest differences in energy and period between PD and NC subjects.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the current resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the potential mechanism of schizophrenia through the posterior–anterior cerebrum imbalance in methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rats and to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as an early-stage intervention. The rats were divided into four groups: the MAM-sham group, vehicle-sham group, MAM-rTMS group, and vehicle-rTMS group. The rTMS treatment was targeted in the visual cortex (VC) in adolescent rats. Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was used to evaluate the effective connectivity between regions of interest. Results demonstrated a critical right VC–nucleus accumbens (Acb)–orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pathway in MAM rats; significant differences of effective connectivity (EC) were found between MAM-sham and vehicle-sham groups (from Acb shell to OFC: t = −2.553, p = 0.021), MAM-rTMS and MAM-sham groups (from VC to Acb core: t = −2.206, p = 0.043; from Acb core to OFC: t = 4.861, p &amp;lt; 0.001; from Acb shell to OFC: t = 4.025, p = 0.001), and MAM-rTMS and vehicle-rTMS groups (from VC to Acb core: t = −2.482, p = 0.025; from VC to Acb shell: t = −2.872, p = 0.012; from Acb core to OFC: t = 4.066, p = 0.001; from Acb shell to OFC: t = 3.458, p = 0.004) in the right hemisphere. Results of the early-stage rTMS intervention revealed that right nucleus accumbens played the role as a central hub, and VC was a potentially novel rTMS target region during adolescent schizophrenia. Moreover, the EC of right nucleus accumbens shell and orbitofrontal cortex was demonstrated to be a potential biomarker. To our knowledge, this was the first resting-state fMRI study using GCA to assess the deficits of a visual-reward neural pathway and the effectiveness of rTMS treatment in MAM rats. More randomized controlled trials in both animal models and schizophrenia patients are needed to further elucidate the disease characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sweat the Fall Stuff: Physical Activity Moderates the Association of White Matter Hyperintensities With Falls Risk in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.671464</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.671464</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Falls in older adults are a major public health problem. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are highly prevalent in older adults and are a risk factor for falls. In the absence of a cure for WMHs, identifying potential strategies to counteract the risk of WMHs on falls are of great importance. Physical activity (PA) is a promising countermeasure to reduce both WMHs and falls risk. However, no study has yet investigated whether PA attenuates the association of WMHs with falls risk. We hypothesized that PA moderates the association between WMHs and falls risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventy-six community-dwelling older adults aged 70–80 years old were included in this cross-sectional study. We indexed PA using the Physical Activity Score for the Elderly (PASE) Questionnaire. Falls risk was assessed using the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), and WMH volume (mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was determined by an experienced radiologist on T2-weighted and PD-weighted MRI scans. We first examined the independent associations of WMH volume and PASE score with PPA. Subsequently, we examined whether PASE moderated the relationship between WMH volume and PPA. We plotted simple slopes to interpret the interaction effects. Age, sex, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were included as covariates in all models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants had a mean age of 74 years (SD = 3 years) and 54 (74%) were female. Forty-nine participants (66%) had a Fazekas score of 1, 19 (26%) had a score of 2, and 6 (8%) a score of 3. Both PASE (β = −0.26 ± 0.11; p = 0.022) and WMH volume (β = 0.23 ± 0.11; p = 0.043) were each independently associated with PPA score. The interaction model indicated that PASE score moderated the association between WMH volume and PPA (β = −0.27 ± 0.12; p = 0.030), whereby higher PASE score attenuated the association between WMHs and falls risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: PA is an important moderator of falls risk. Importantly, older adults with WMH can reduce their risk of falls by increasing their PA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Predicting Brain Regions Related to Alzheimer's Disease Based on Global Feature</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.659838</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.659838</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly affects the elderly; early diagnosis and timely treatment are very important to delay the course of the disease. In the past, most brain regions related to AD were identified based on imaging methods, and only some atrophic brain regions could be identified. In this work, the authors used mathematical models to identify the potential brain regions related to AD. In this study, 20 patients with AD and 13 healthy controls (non-AD) were recruited by the neurology outpatient department or the neurology ward of Peking University First Hospital from September 2017 to March 2019. First, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to construct the brain structural network. Next, the authors set a new local feature index 2hop-connectivity to measure the correlation between different regions. Compared with the traditional graph theory index, 2hop-connectivity exploits the higher-order information of the graph structure. And for this purpose, the authors proposed a novel algorithm called 2hopRWR to measure 2hop-connectivity. Then, a new index global feature score (GFS) based on a global feature was proposed by combing five local features, namely degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, the number of maximal cliques, and 2hop-connectivity, to judge which brain regions are related to AD. As a result, the top ten brain regions identified using the GFS scoring difference between the AD and the non-AD groups were associated to AD by literature verification. The results of the literature validation comparing GFS with the local features showed that GFS was superior to individual local features. Finally, the results of the canonical correlation analysis showed that the GFS was significantly correlated with the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Therefore, the authors believe the GFS can also be used as a new biomarker to assist in diagnosis and objective monitoring of disease progression. Besides, the method proposed in this paper can be used as a differential network analysis method for network analysis in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Notch3-Dependent Effects on Adult Neurogenesis and Hippocampus-Dependent Learning in a Modified Transgenic Model of CADASIL</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.617733</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.617733</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We and others have reported that Notch3 is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common genetic form of vascular dementia, is caused by mutations in Notch3. The present study intended to investigate whether there is a correlation between altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory performance in CADASIL transgenic mice. To overcome visual disabilities that hampered behavioral testing of the original mice (on an FVB background) we back-crossed the existing TgN3&lt;sup&gt;R169C&lt;/sup&gt; CADASIL mouse model onto the C57BL/6J background. These animals showed an age-dependent increase in the pathognomonic granular osmiophilic material (GOM) deposition in the hippocampus. Analysis in the Morris water maze task at an age of 6 and 12 months revealed deficits in re-learning and perseverance in the CADASIL transgenic mice. Overexpression of Notch3 alone resulted in deficits in the use of spatial strategies and diminished adult neurogenesis in both age groups. The additional CADASIL mutation compensated the effect on strategy usage but not on adult neurogenesis. In brain bank tissue samples from deceased CADASIL patients we found signs of new neurons, as assessed by calretinin immunohistochemistry, but no conclusive quantification was possible. In summary, while our study confirmed the role of Notch3 in adult neurogenesis, we found a specific effect of the CADASIL mutation only on the reversion of the Notch3 effect on behavior, particularly visible at 6 months of age, consistent with a loss of function. The mutation did not revert the Notch3-dependent changes in adult neurogenesis or otherwise affected adult neurogenesis in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) controls diverse behaviors and physiologic functions, suggesting the existence of multiple VMH neural subtypes with distinct functions. Combing Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification with RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) data with snRNA-seq data, we identified 24 mouse VMH neuron clusters. Further analysis, including snRNA-seq data from macaque tissue, defined a more tractable VMH parceling scheme consisting of 6 major genetically- and anatomically-differentiated VMH neuron classes with good cross-species conservation. In addition to two major ventrolateral classes, we identified three distinct classes of dorsomedial VMH neurons. Consistent with previously-suggested unique roles for leptin receptor (&lt;i&gt;Lepr&lt;/i&gt;)-expressing VMH neurons, &lt;i&gt;Lepr &lt;/i&gt;expression marked a single dorsomedial class. We also identified a class of glutamatergic VMH neurons that resides in the tuberal region, anterolateral to the neuroanatomical core of the VMH. This atlas of conserved VMH neuron populations provides an unbiased starting point for the analysis of VMH circuitry and function.</description>

	<title>eLife: Thirst interneurons that promote water seeking and limit feeding behavior in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66286</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66286</link>
	<description>Thirst is a motivational state that drives behaviors to obtain water for fluid homeostasis. We identified two types of central brain interneurons that regulate thirsty water seeking in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, that we term the Janu neurons. Janu-GABA, a local interneuron in the subesophageal zone, is activated by water deprivation and is specific to thirsty seeking. Janu-AstA projects from the subesophageal zone to the superior medial protocerebrum, a higher order processing area. Janu-AstA signals with the neuropeptide Allatostatin A to promote water seeking and to inhibit feeding behavior. NPF (&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; NPY) neurons are postsynaptic to Janu-AstA for water seeking and feeding through the AstA-R2 galanin-like receptor. NPF neurons use NPF to regulate thirst and hunger behaviors. Flies choose Janu neuron activation, suggesting that thirsty seeking up a humidity gradient is rewarding. These findings identify novel central brain circuit elements that coordinate internal state drives to selectively control motivated seeking behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: Perturbation of amygdala-cortical projections reduces ensemble coherence of palatability coding in gustatory cortex</title>

	<description>Taste palatability is centrally involved in consumption decisions—we ingest foods that taste good and reject those that don't. Gustatory cortex (GC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) almost certainly work together to mediate palatability-driven behavior, but the precise nature of their interplay during taste decision-making is still unknown. To probe this issue, we discretely perturbed (with optogenetics) activity in rats’ BLA→GC axons during taste deliveries. This perturbation strongly altered GC taste responses, but while the perturbation itself was tonic (2.5 s), the alterations were not—changes preferentially aligned with the onset times of previously-described taste response epochs, and reduced evidence of palatability-related activity in the ‘late-epoch’ of the responses without reducing the amount of taste identity information available in the ‘middle epoch.’ Finally, BLA→GC perturbations changed behavior-linked taste response dynamics themselves, distinctively diminishing the abruptness of ensemble transitions into the late epoch. These results suggest that BLA ‘organizes’ behavior-related GC taste dynamics.</description>

	<title>eLife: Symmetry breaking meets multisite modification</title>

	<description>Multisite modification is a basic way of conferring functionality to proteins, and a key component of post-translational modification networks. Additional interest in multisite modification stems from its capability of acting as complex information processors. In this paper we connect two seemingly disparate themes: symmetry and multisite modification. We examine different classes of random modification networks of substrates involving separate or common enzymes. We demonstrate that under different instances of symmetry of the modification network (invoked explicitly or implicitly and discussed in the literature), the biochemistry of multisite modification can lead to the symmetry being broken. This is shown computationally and consolidated analytically, revealing parameter regions where this can (and in fact does) happen, and characteristics of the symmetry broken state. We discuss the relevance of these results in situations where exact symmetry is not present. Overall, through our study we show how symmetry breaking (i) can confer new capabilities to protein networks, including concentration robustness of different combinations of species (in conjunction with multiple steady states) (ii) could have been the basis for ordering of multisite modification, which is widely observed in cells (iii) can significantly impact information processing in multisite modification and in cell signalling networks/pathways where multisite modification is present (iv) can be a fruitful new angle for engineering in synthetic biology and chemistry. All in all, the emerging conceptual synthesis provides a new vantage point for the elucidation and the engineering of molecular systems at the junction of chemical and biological systems.</description>

	<title>eLife: Amphiphysin I cleavage by asparagine endopeptidase leads to tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65301</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65301</link>
	<description>Neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic dysfunction are characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identified Amphiphysin I mediates both tau phosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction in AD. Amphiphysin I is cleaved by a cysteine proteinase asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) at N278 in the brains of AD patients. The amount of AEP-generated N-terminal fragment of Amphiphysin I (1-278) is increased with aging. Amphiphysin I (1-278) inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis and induces synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, Amphiphysin I (1-278) binds p35 and promotes its transition to p25, thus activates CDK5 and enhances tau hyperphosphorylation. Overexpression of Amphiphysin I (1-278) in the hippocampus of Tau P301S mice induces synaptic dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cognitive deficits. However, overexpression of the N278A mutant Amphiphysin I, which resists the AEP-mediated cleavage, alleviates the pathological and behavioral defects. These findings suggest a mechanism of tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction in AD.</description>

	<description>The Gram-positive bacterium &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; can divide via two modes. During vegetative growth, the division septum is formed at the midcell to produce two equal daughter cells. However, during sporulation, the division septum is formed closer to one pole to yield a smaller forespore and a larger mother cell. Using cryo-electron tomography, genetics and fluorescence microscopy, we found that the organization of the division machinery is different in the two septa. While FtsAZ filaments, the major orchestrators of bacterial cell division, are present uniformly around the leading edge of the invaginating vegetative septa, they are only present on the mother cell side of the invaginating sporulation septa. We provide evidence suggesting that the different distribution and number of FtsAZ filaments impact septal thickness, causing vegetative septa to be thicker than sporulation septa already during constriction. Finally, we show that a sporulation-specific protein, SpoIIE, regulates asymmetric divisome localization and septal thickness during sporulation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Kv1.1 channels regulate early postnatal neurogenesis in mouse hippocampus via the TrkB signaling pathway</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58779</link>
	<description>In the postnatal brain, neurogenesis occurs only within a few regions, such as the hippocampal sub-granular zone (SGZ). Postnatal neurogenesis is tightly regulated by factors that balance stem cell renewal with differentiation, and it gives rise to neurons that participate in learning and memory formation (Anacker and Hen, 2017; Bond et al., 2015; Toda et al., 2019). The Kv1.1 channel, a voltage-gated potassium channel, was previously shown to suppress postnatal neurogenesis in the SGZ in a cell-autonomous manner. In this study, we clarified the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying Kv1.1-dependent postnatal neurogenesis. First, we discovered that the membrane potential of neural progenitor cells is highly dynamic during development. We further established a multinomial logistic regression model for cell type classification based on the biophysical characteristics and corresponding cell markers. We found that loss of Kv1.1 channel activity causes significant depolarization of type 2b neural progenitor cells. This depolarization is associated with increased tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling and proliferation of neural progenitor cells; suppressing TrkB signaling reduces the extent of postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, our study defines the role of the Kv1.1 potassium channel in regulating the proliferation of postnatal neural progenitor cells in the mouse hippocampus.</description>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for massive detection of DNA sequence variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels). For routine screening of numerous samples, these variants are often converted into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers which are based on the presence versus absence of restriction sites within PCR products. Current computational tools for SNP to CAPS conversion are limited and usually infeasible to use for large datasets as those generated with NGS. Moreover, there is no available tool for massive conversion of MNPs and indels into CAPS markers. Here, we present VCF2CAPS–a new software for identification of restriction endonucleases that recognize SNP/MNP/indel-containing sequences from NGS experiments. Additionally, the program contains filtration utilities not available in other SNP to CAPS converters–selection of markers with a single polymorphic cut site within a user-specified sequence length, and selection of markers that differentiate up to three user-defined groups of individuals from the analyzed population. Performance of VCF2CAPS was tested on a thoroughly analyzed dataset from a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) experiment. A selection of CAPS markers picked by the program was subjected to experimental verification. CAPS markers, also referred to as PCR-RFLPs, belong to basic tools exploited in plant, animal and human genetics. Our new software–VCF2CAPS–fills the gap in the current inventory of genetic software by high-throughput CAPS marker design from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The program should be of interest to geneticists involved in molecular diagnostics. In this paper we show a successful exemplary application of VCF2CAPS and we believe that its usefulness is guaranteed by the growing availability of NGS services.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uDC8hhIenBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The visual system must make predictions to compensate for inherent delays in its processing. Yet little is known, mechanistically, about how prediction aids natural behaviors. Here, we show that despite a 20-30ms intrinsic processing delay, the vertical motion sensitive (VS) network of the blowfly achieves maximally efficient prediction. This prediction enables the fly to fine-tune its complex, yet brief, evasive flight maneuvers according to its initial ego-rotation at the time of detection of the visual threat. Combining a rich database of behavioral recordings with detailed compartmental modeling of the VS network, we further show that the VS network has axonal gap junctions that are critical for optimal prediction. During evasive maneuvers, a VS subpopulation that directly innervates the neck motor center can convey predictive information about the fly’s future ego-rotation, potentially crucial for ongoing flight control. These results suggest a novel sensory-motor pathway that links sensory prediction to behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8TBlQCb56lA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: What do Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles have to do with genome assembly?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul Medvedev, Mihai Pop&lt;/p&gt;

Many students are taught about genome assembly using the dichotomy between the complexity of finding Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles (easy versus hard, respectively). This dichotomy is sometimes used to motivate the use of de Bruijn graphs in practice. In this paper, we explain that while de Bruijn graphs have indeed been very useful, the reason has nothing to do with the complexity of the Hamiltonian and Eulerian cycle problems. We give 2 arguments. The first is that a genome reconstruction is never unique and hence an algorithm for finding Eulerian or Hamiltonian cycles is not part of any assembly algorithm used in practice. The second is that even if an arbitrary genome reconstruction was desired, one could do so in linear time in both the Eulerian and Hamiltonian paradigms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AaSxW5SRoR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Conformational plasticity and dynamic interactions of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptor CXCR1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Shalmali Kharche, Manali Joshi, Amitabha Chattopadhyay, Durba Sengupta&lt;/p&gt;

The dynamic interactions between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their cognate protein partners are central to several cell signaling pathways. For example, the association of CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) with its cognate chemokine, interleukin-8 (IL8 or CXCL8) initiates pathways leading to neutrophil-mediated immune responses. The N-terminal domain of chemokine receptors confers ligand selectivity, but unfortunately the conformational dynamics of this intrinsically disordered region remains unresolved. In this work, we have explored the interaction of CXCR1 with IL8 by microsecond time scale coarse-grain simulations, complemented by atomistic models and NMR chemical shift predictions. We show that the conformational plasticity of the &lt;i&gt;apo&lt;/i&gt;-receptor N-terminal domain is restricted upon ligand binding, driving it to an open C-shaped conformation. Importantly, we corroborated the dynamic complex sampled in our simulations against chemical shift perturbations reported by previous NMR studies and show that the trends are similar. Our results indicate that chemical shift perturbation is often not a reporter of residue contacts in such dynamic associations. We believe our results represent a step forward in devising a strategy to understand intrinsically disordered regions in GPCRs and how they acquire functionally important conformational ensembles in dynamic protein-protein interfaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZHuW7BxNtJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The adaptive immune system serves as a potent and highly specific defense mechanism against pathogen infection. One component of this system, the effector T cell, facilitates pathogen clearance upon detection of specific antigens by the T cell receptor (TCR). A critical process in effector T cell activation is transmission of signals from the TCR to a key transcriptional regulator, NF-κB. The transmission of this signal involves a highly dynamic process in which helical filaments of Bcl10, a key protein constituent of the TCR signaling cascade, undergo competing processes of polymeric assembly and macroautophagy-dependent degradation. Through computational analysis of three-dimensional, super-resolution optical micrographs, we quantitatively characterize TCR-stimulated Bcl10 filament assembly and length dynamics, and demonstrate that filaments become shorter over time. Additionally, we develop an image-based, bootstrap-like resampling method that demonstrates the preferred association between autophagosomes and both Bcl10-filament ends and punctate-Bcl10 structures, implying that autophagosome-driven macroautophagy is directly responsible for Bcl10 filament shortening. We probe Bcl10 polymerization-depolymerization dynamics with a stochastic Monte-Carlo simulation of nucleation-limited filament assembly and degradation, and we show that high probabilities of filament nucleation in response to TCR engagement could provide the observed robust, homogeneous, and tunable response dynamic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the speed of filament disassembly preferentially at filament ends provides effective regulatory control. Taken together, these data suggest that Bcl10 filament growth and degradation act as an excitable system that provides a digital response mechanism and the reliable timing critical for T cell activation and regulatory processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V-_mpr38Fp8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Extracellular DJ-1 induces sterile inflammation in the ischemic brain</title>

Inflammation is implicated in the onset and progression of various diseases, including cerebral pathologies. Here, we report that DJ-1, which plays a role within cells as an antioxidant protein, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and triggers inflammation if released from dead cells into the extracellular space. We first found that recombinant DJ-1 protein induces the production of various inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) and dendritic cells (BMDCs). We further identified a unique peptide sequence in the αG and αH helices of DJ-1 that activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. In the ischemic brain, DJ-1 is released into the extracellular space from necrotic neurons within 24 h after stroke onset and makes direct contact with TLR2 and TLR4 in infiltrating myeloid cells. Although DJ-1 deficiency in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion did not attenuate neuronal injury, the inflammatory cytokine expression in infiltrating immune cells was significantly decreased. Next, we found that the administration of an antibody to neutralize extracellular DJ-1 suppressed cerebral post-ischemic inflammation and attenuated ischemic neuronal damage. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown function of DJ-1 as a DAMP and suggest that extracellular DJ-1 could be a therapeutic target to prevent inflammation in tissue injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zsBOh2aXGow&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A causal role for the pulvinar in coordinating task‐independent cortico‐cortical interactions</title>

	<description>Abstract
The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico‐pulvino‐cortical input‐output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico‐cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task‐dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large‐scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (LIP) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4‐15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4‐15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large‐scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neural mechanisms supporting flexible relational inferences, especially
in novel situations, are a major focus of current research. In the
complementary learning systems framework, pattern separation in the hippocampus
allows rapid learning in novel environments, while slower learning in neocortex
accumulates small weight changes to extract systematic structure from
well-learned environments. In this work, we adapt this framework to a task from
a recent fMRI experiment where novel transitive inferences must be made
according to implicit relational structure. We show that computational models
capturing the basic cognitive properties of these two systems can explain
relational transitive inferences in both familiar and novel environments, and
reproduce key phenomena observed in the fMRI experiment.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest in emulating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
on neuromorphic computing devices due to their low energy consumption. Recent
advances have allowed training SNNs to a point where they start to compete with
traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of accuracy, while at
the same time being energy efficient when run on neuromorphic hardware.
However, the process of training SNNs is still based on dense tensor operations
originally developed for ANNs which do not leverage the spatiotemporally sparse
nature of SNNs. We present here the first sparse SNN backpropagation algorithm
which achieves the same or better accuracy as current state of the art methods
while being significantly faster and more memory efficient. We show the
effectiveness of our method on real datasets of varying complexity
(Fashion-MNIST, Neuromophic-MNIST and Spiking Heidelberg Digits) achieving a
speedup in the backward pass of up to 70x, and 40% more memory efficient,
without losing accuracy.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Three Dimensional Route Planning for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using Salp Swarm Algorithm. (arXiv:1911.10519v3 [cs.RO] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Route planning for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a series of
translation and rotational steps from a given start location to the destination
goal location. The goal of the route planning problem is to determine the most
optimal route avoiding any collisions with the obstacles present in the
environment. Route planning is an NP-hard optimization problem. In this paper,
a newly proposed Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is used, and its performance is
compared with deterministic and other Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIAs). The
results illustrate that SSA outperforms all the other meta-heuristic algorithms
in route planning for multiple UAVs in a 3D environment. The proposed approach
improves the average cost and overall time by 1.25% and 6.035% respectively
when compared to recently reported data. Route planning is involved in many
real-life applications like robot navigation, self-driving car, autonomous UAV
for search and rescue operations in dangerous ground-zero situations, civilian
surveillance, military combat and even commercial services like package
delivery by drones.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders typically characterized by recurrent and uncontrollable seizures, which seriously affects the quality of life of epilepsy patients. The effective tool utilized in the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy is the Electroencephalogram (EEG). The emergence of machine learning promotes the development of automated epilepsy detection techniques. New algorithms are continuously introduced to shorten the detection time and improve classification accuracy. This minireview summarized the latest research of epilepsy detection techniques that focused on acquiring, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of epileptic EEG signals. The application of seizure prediction and localization based on EEG signals in the diagnosis of epilepsy was also introduced. And then, the future development trend of epilepsy detection technology has prospected at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, the management of acute and chronic pain in clinical practice remains unsatisfactory due to the existence of limited effective treatments, and novel therapeutic strategies for pathological pain are urgently needed. In the past few decades, the role of serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) in the development of pain and diurnal rhythms has been implicated in numerous studies. The expression levels of SGK1 mRNA and protein were found to be elevated in the spinal cord and brain in various pathological pain models. Blocking SGK1 significantly attenuated pain-like responses and the development of pathological pain. These studies provide strong evidence that SGK1 plays a role in the development of various types of pathological pain and that targeting SGK1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pain management. In this review article, we provide evidence from animal models for the potential role of SGK1 in the regulation of pathological pain caused by inflammation, nerve injury, psychiatric disorders, and chronic opioid exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuropeptide Localization in Lymnaea stagnalis: From the Central Nervous System to Subcellular Compartments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.670303</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the relatively small number of neurons (few tens of thousands), the well-established multipurpose model organism Lymnaea stagnalis, great pond snail, has been extensively used to study the functioning of the nervous system. Unlike the more complex brains of higher organisms, L. stagnalis has a relatively simple central nervous system (CNS) with well-defined circuits (e.g., feeding, locomotion, learning, and memory) and identified individual neurons (e.g., cerebral giant cell, CGC), which generate behavioral patterns. Accumulating information from electrophysiological experiments maps the network of neuronal connections and the neuronal circuits responsible for basic life functions. Chemical signaling between synaptic-coupled neurons is underpinned by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. This review looks at the rapidly expanding contributions of mass spectrometry (MS) to neuropeptide discovery and identification at different granularity of CNS organization. Abundances and distributions of neuropeptides in the whole CNS, eleven interconnected ganglia, neuronal clusters, single neurons, and subcellular compartments are captured by MS imaging and single cell analysis techniques. Combining neuropeptide expression and electrophysiological data, and aided by genomic and transcriptomic information, the molecular basis of CNS-controlled biological functions is increasingly revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Microglia Stimulation by Protein Extract of Injured Rat Spinal Cord. A Novel In vitro Model for Studying Activated Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research on microglia has established the differentiation between the so-called M1 and M2 phenotypes. However, new frameworks have been proposed attempting to discern between meaningful microglia profiles. We have set up an in vitro microglial activation model by adding an injured spinal cord (SCI) lysate to microglial cultures, obtained from postnatal rats, in order to mimic the environment of the spinal cord after injury. We found that under the presence of the SCI lysate microglial cells changed their phenotype, developing less ramified but longer processes, and proliferated. The SCI lysate also led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, downregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4, and a biphasic profile of iNOS. In addition, a latex beads phagocytosis assay revealed the SCI lysate stimulated the phagocytic capacity of microglia. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that microglial cells showed a pro-inflammatory profile in the presence of SCI lysate. Finally, characterization of the microglial activation in the spinal cord on day 7 after contusion injury, we showed that these cells have a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Overall, these results indicate that the use of SCI lysates could be a useful tool to skew microglia towards a closer phenotype to that observed after the spinal cord contusion injury than the use of LPS or IFNγ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. It is a chronic and progressive disorder estimated to affect at least 4 million people worldwide. Although the etiology of PD remains unclear, it has been found that the dysfunction of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) in neural terminal happens before the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recently, accumulating evidence reveals that the PD-linked synaptic genes, including DNAJC6, SYNJ1, and SH3GL2, significantly contribute to the disruptions of SVE, which is vital for the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, the proteins encoded by other PD-associated genes such as SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, and DJ-1 also play key roles in the regulation of SVE. Here we present the facts about SVE-related genes and discussed their potential relevance to the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Combining Electrostimulation With Fiber Tracking to Stratify the Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.683348</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) is one of the longest association fiber tracts of the brain. According to the most recent anatomical studies, it may be formed by several layers, suggesting a role in multiple cognitive functions. However, to date, no attempt has been made to dissociate the functional contribution of the IFOF subpathways. In this study, real-time, cortico-subcortical mapping with direct electrostimulation was performed in 111 patients operated on in wide-awake surgery for a right low-grade glioma. Patients performed two behavioral tasks during stimulation, tapping, respectively, mentalizing and visual semantic cognition—two functions supposed to be partly mediated by the IFOF. Responsive white matter sites were first subjected to a clustering analysis to assess potential topological differences in network organization. Then they were used as seeds to generate streamline tractograms based on the HC1021 diffusion dataset (template-based approach). The tractograms obtained for each function were overlapped and contrasted to determine whether some fiber pathways were more frequently involved in one or the other function. The obtained results not only provided strong evidence for a role of the right IFOF in both functions, but also revealed that the tract is dissociable into two functional strata according to a ventral (semantic) and dorsal (mentalizing) compartmentalization. Besides, they showed a high degree of anatomo-functionnal variability across patients in the functional implication of the IFOF, possibly related to symmetrical/hemispheric differences in network organization. Collectively, these findings support the view that the right IFOF is a functionally multi-layered structure, with nevertheless interindividual variations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Knock-Out of Tenascin-C Ameliorates Ischemia-Induced Rod-Photoreceptor Degeneration and Retinal Dysfunction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal ischemia is a common pathomechanism in various eye diseases. Recently, evidence accumulated suggesting that the extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein tenascin-C (Tnc) plays a key role in ischemic degeneration. However, the possible functional role of Tnc in retinal ischemia is not yet known. The aim of our study was to explore retinal function and rod-bipolar/photoreceptor cell degeneration in wild type (WT) and Tnc knock-out (KO) mice after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Therefore, I/R was induced by increasing intraocular pressure in the right eye of wild type (WT I/R) and Tnc KO (KO I/R) mice. The left eye served as untreated control (WT CO and KO CO). Scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed to examine rod-bipolar and rod-photoreceptor cell function. Changes of Tnc, rod-bipolar cells, photoreceptors, retinal structure and apoptotic and synaptic alterations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, Western blot, and quantitative real time PCR. We found increased Tnc protein levels 3 days after ischemia, while Tnc immunoreactivity decreased after 7 days. Tnc mRNA expression was comparable in the ischemic retina. ERG measurements after 7 days showed lower a-/b-wave amplitudes in both ischemic groups. Nevertheless, the amplitudes in the KO I/R group were higher than in the WT I/R group. We observed retinal thinning in WT I/R mice after 3 and 7 days. Although compared to the KO CO group, retinal thinning was not observed in the KO I/R group until 7 days. The number of PKCα&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rod-bipolar cells, recoverin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; photoreceptor staining and Prkca and Rcvrn expression were comparable in all groups. However, reduced rhodopsin protein as well as Rho and Gnat1 mRNA expression levels of rod-photoreceptors were found in the WT I/R, but not in the KO I/R retina. Additionally, a lower number of activated caspase 3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells was observed in the KO I/R group. Finally, both ischemic groups displayed enhanced vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) levels. Collectively, KO mice showed diminished rod-photoreceptor degeneration and retinal dysfunction after I/R. Elevated vGlut1 levels after ischemia could be related to an impaired glutamatergic photoreceptor-bipolar cell signaling and excitotoxicity. Our study provides novel evidence that Tnc reinforces ischemic retinal degeneration, possibly by synaptic remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Hypometabolism may be partly due to reduced glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and across astrocytic and neuronal cell membranes. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are integral membrane proteins responsible for moving glucose from the bloodstream to parenchymal cells where it is metabolized, and evidence indicates vascular and non-vascular GLUTs are altered in AD brains, a process which could starve the brain of glucose and accelerate cognitive decline. Here we review the literature on glucose transport alterations in AD from human and rodent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Literature published between 1st January 1946 and 1st November 2020 within EMBASE and MEDLINE databases was searched for the terms “glucose transporters” AND “Alzheimer's disease”. Human and rodent studies were included while reviews, letters, and in-vitro studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Forty-three studies fitting the inclusion criteria were identified, covering human (23 studies) and rodent (20 studies). Post-mortem studies showed consistent reductions in GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, areas of the brain closely associated with AD pathology. Tracer studies in rodent models of AD and human AD also exhibit reduced uptake of glucose and glucose-analogs into the brain, supporting these findings. Longitudinal rodent studies clearly indicate that changes in GLUT1 and GLUT3 only occur after amyloid-β pathology is present, and several studies indicate amyloid-β itself may be responsible for GLUT changes. Furthermore, evidence from human and rodent studies suggest GLUT depletion has severe effects on brain function. A small number of studies show GLUT2 and GLUT12 are increased in AD. Anti-diabetic medications improved glucose transport capacity in AD subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: GLUT1 and GLUT3 are reduced in hippocampal and cortical regions in patients and rodent models of AD, and may be caused by high levels of amyloid-β in these regions. GLUT3 reductions appear to precede the onset of clinical symptoms. GLUT2 and GLUT12 appear to increase and may have a compensatory role. Repurposing anti-diabetic drugs to modify glucose transport shows promising results in human studies of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Focal Damage to the Right Medial Posterior Cerebellum on Word and Sentence Comprehension and Production</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional imaging studies of neurologically intact adults have demonstrated that the right posterior cerebellum is activated during verb generation, semantic processing, sentence processing, and verbal fluency. Studies of patients with cerebellar damage converge to show that the cerebellum supports sentence processing and verbal fluency. However, to date there are no patient studies that investigated the specific importance of the right posterior cerebellum in language processing, because: (i) case studies presented patients with lesions affecting the anterior cerebellum (with or without damage to the posterior cerebellum), and (ii) group studies combined patients with lesions to different cerebellar regions, without specifically reporting the effects of right posterior cerebellar damage. Here we investigated whether damage to the right posterior cerebellum is critical for sentence processing and verbal fluency in four patients with focal stroke damage to different parts of the right posterior cerebellum (all involving Crus II, and lobules VII and VIII). We examined detailed lesion location by going beyond common anatomical definitions of cerebellar anatomy (i.e., according to lobules or vascular territory), and employed a recently proposed functional parcellation of the cerebellum. All four patients experienced language difficulties that persisted for at least a month after stroke but three performed in the normal range within a year. In contrast, one patient with more damage to lobule IX than the other patients had profound long-lasting impairments in the comprehension and repetition of sentences, and the production of spoken sentences during picture description. Spoken and written word comprehension and visual recognition memory were also impaired, however, verbal fluency was within the normal range, together with object naming, visual perception and verbal short-term memory. This is the first study to show that focal damage to the right posterior cerebellum leads to language difficulties after stroke; and that processing impairments persisted in the case with most damage to lobule IX. We discuss these results in relation to current theories of cerebellar contribution to language processing. Overall, our study highlights the need for longitudinal studies of language function in patients with focal damage to different cerebellar regions, with functional imaging to understand the mechanisms that support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Thalamic but Not Subthalamic Neuromodulation Simplifies Word Use in Spontaneous Language</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several investigations have shown language impairments following electrode implantation surgery for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders. The impact of the actual stimulation, however, differs between DBS targets with further deterioration in formal language tests induced by thalamic DBS in contrast to subtle improvement observed in subthalamic DBS. Here, we studied speech samples from interviews with participants treated with DBS of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) for essential tremor (ET), or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy volunteers (each n = 13). We analyzed word frequency and the use of open and closed class words. Active DBS increased word frequency in case of VIM, but not STN stimulation. Further, relative to controls, both DBS groups produced fewer open class words. Whereas VIM DBS further decreased the proportion of open class words, it was increased by STN DBS. Thus, VIM DBS favors the use of relatively common words in spontaneous language, compatible with the idea of lexical simplification under thalamic stimulation. The absence or even partial reversal of these effects in patients receiving STN DBS is of interest with respect to biolinguistic concepts suggesting dichotomous thalamic vs. basal ganglia roles in language processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Clinical Validation of the Champagne Algorithm for Epilepsy Spike Localization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is increasingly used for presurgical planning in people with medically refractory focal epilepsy. Localization of interictal epileptiform activity, a surrogate for the seizure onset zone whose removal may prevent seizures, is challenging and depends on the use of multiple complementary techniques. Accurate and reliable localization of epileptiform activity from spontaneous MEG data has been an elusive goal. One approach toward this goal is to use a novel Bayesian inference algorithm—the Champagne algorithm with noise learning—which has shown tremendous success in source reconstruction, especially for focal brain sources. In this study, we localized sources of manually identified MEG spikes using the Champagne algorithm in a cohort of 16 patients with medically refractory epilepsy collected in two consecutive series. To evaluate the reliability of this approach, we compared the performance to equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling, a conventional source localization technique that is commonly used in clinical practice. Results suggest that Champagne may be a robust, automated, alternative to manual parametric dipole fitting methods for localization of interictal MEG spikes, in addition to its previously described clinical and research applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Anxiety: An Investigation of the Moderating Role of Sex in Performance Monitoring and Attentional Bias to Threat in High Trait Anxious Individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.627589</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.627589</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are more predominant in women than men, however there is a lack of understanding as to what neurocognitive mechanisms drive this sex difference. Recent investigation has found a potential moderating role of sex in the relationship between anxiety and the error related negativity (ERN)—a component of error-monitoring that is prevalent in high anxiety individuals—such that females display a positive relationship between anxiety/worry and ERN amplitude. We strove to further explore the influence of sex on the relationship between trait anxiety and performance monitoring, specifically with ERN, as well as extend this work to include another hallmark of anxiety, attentional bias to threat. To meet this end, participants performed the flanker and dot-probe tasks, respectively. We did not find a significant difference in the relationship between attention bias scores and anxiety for female vs. males participants. Furthermore, ΔERN amplitudes were greater in males compared to females, and males had more positive CRN amplitudes than females. There were no significant associations between ERN or ΔERN with anxiety in both male and female participants. However, there was a significant relationship between CRN amplitudes and trait anxiety in male but not female participants. Given these results, the effect of sex on the relationship between components of performance monitoring—namely the CRN and ERN—and anxiety may be more nuanced than the current understanding. Our study was limited to detecting medium to large sized moderation effects. Our findings may be important for future meta-analysis on sex differences in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Non-spiking Neuron Model With Dynamic Leak to Avoid Instability in Recurrent Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.656401</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent circuitry components are distributed widely within the brain, including both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. Recurrent neuronal networks have potential stability problems, perhaps a predisposition to epilepsy. More generally, instability risks making internal representations of information unreliable. To assess the inherent stability properties of such recurrent networks, we tested a linear summation, non-spiking neuron model with and without a “dynamic leak”, corresponding to the low-pass filtering of synaptic input current by the RC circuit of the biological membrane. We first show that the output of this neuron model, in either of its two forms, follows its input at a higher fidelity than a wide range of spiking neuron models across a range of input frequencies. Then we constructed fully connected recurrent networks with equal numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and randomly distributed weights across all synapses. When the networks were driven by pseudorandom sensory inputs with varying frequency, the recurrent network activity tended to induce high frequency self-amplifying components, sometimes evident as distinct transients, which were not present in the input data. The addition of a dynamic leak based on known membrane properties consistently removed such spurious high frequency noise across all networks. Furthermore, we found that the neuron model with dynamic leak imparts a network stability that seamlessly scales with the size of the network, conduction delays, the input density of the sensory signal and a wide range of synaptic weight distributions. Our findings suggest that neuronal dynamic leak serves the beneficial function of protecting recurrent neuronal circuitry from the self-induction of spurious high frequency signals, thereby permitting the brain to utilize this architectural circuitry component regardless of network size or recurrency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Differential Contributions of Inhibitory Subnetwork to Visual Cortical Modulations Identified via Computational Model of Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.632730</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extrastriate visual neurons show no firing rate change during a working memory (WM) task in the absence of sensory input, but both αβ oscillations and spike phase locking are enhanced, as is the gain of sensory responses. This lack of change in firing rate is at odds with many models of WM, or attentional modulation of sensory networks. In this article we devised a computational model in which this constellation of results can be accounted for via selective activation of inhibitory subnetworks by a top-down working memory signal. We confirmed the model prediction of selective inhibitory activation by segmenting cells in the experimental neural data into putative excitatory and inhibitory cells. We further found that this inhibitory activation plays a dual role in influencing excitatory cells: it both modulates the inhibitory tone of the network, which underlies the enhanced sensory gain, and also produces strong spike-phase entrainment to emergent network oscillations. Using a phase oscillator model we were able to show that inhibitory tone is principally modulated through inhibitory network gain saturation, while the phase-dependent efficacy of inhibitory currents drives the phase locking modulation. The dual contributions of the inhibitory subnetwork to oscillatory and non-oscillatory modulations of neural activity provides two distinct ways for WM to recruit sensory areas, and has relevance to theories of cortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: The Face Module Emerged in a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Selectively Deprived of Face Experience</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Can we recognize faces with zero experience on faces? This question is critical because it examines the role of experiences in the formation of domain-specific modules in the brain. Investigation with humans and non-human animals on this issue cannot easily dissociate the effect of the visual experience from that of the hardwired domain-specificity. Therefore, the present study built a model of selective deprivation of the experience on faces with a representative deep convolutional neural network, AlexNet, by removing all images containing faces from its training stimuli. This model did not show significant deficits in face categorization and discrimination, and face-selective modules automatically emerged. However, the deprivation reduced the domain-specificity of the face module. In sum, our study provides empirical evidence on the role of nature vs. nurture in developing the domain-specific modules that domain-specificity may evolve from non-specific experience without genetic predisposition, and is further fine-tuned by domain-specific experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Begonia—A Two-Photon Imaging Analysis Pipeline for Astrocytic Ca2+ Signals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Imaging the intact brain of awake behaving mice without the dampening effects of anesthesia, has revealed an exceedingly rich repertoire of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Analyzing and interpreting such complex signals pose many challenges. Traditional analyses of fluorescent changes typically rely on manually outlined static region-of-interests, but such analyses fail to capture the intricate spatiotemporal patterns of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. Moreover, all astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data obtained from awake behaving mice need to be interpreted in light of the complex behavioral patterns of the animal. Hence processing multimodal data, including animal behavior metrics, stimulation timings, and electrophysiological signals is needed to interpret astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Managing and incorporating these data types into a coherent analysis pipeline is challenging and time-consuming, especially if research protocols change or new data types are added. Here, we introduce Begonia, a MATLAB-based data management and analysis toolbox tailored for the analyses of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in conjunction with behavioral data. The analysis suite includes an automatic, event-based algorithm with few input parameters that can capture a high level of spatiotemporal complexity of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. The toolbox enables the experimentalist to quantify astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in a precise and unbiased way and combine them with other types of time series data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inherited forms of deafness account for a sizable portion of hearing loss among children and adult populations. Many patients with sensorineural deficits have pathological manifestations in the peripheral auditory system, the inner ear. Within the hearing organ, the cochlea, most of the genetic forms of hearing loss involve defects in sensory detection and to some extent, signaling to the brain via the auditory cranial nerve. This review focuses on peripheral forms of hereditary hearing loss and how these impairments can be studied in diverse animal models or patient-derived cells with the ultimate goal of using the knowledge gained to understand the underlying biology and treat hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes comprise a heterogeneous cell population characterized by distinct morphologies, protein expression and function. Unlike neurons, astrocytes do not generate action potentials, however, they are electrically dynamic cells with extensive electrophysiological heterogeneity and diversity. Astrocytes are hyperpolarized cells with low membrane resistance. They are heavily involved in the modulation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and express an array of different voltage-dependent and voltage-independent channels to help with this ion regulation. In addition to these K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, astrocytes also express several different types of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in astrocytes has been linked to some of their functional properties. The physiological hallmark of astrocytes is their extensive intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling cascades, which vary at the regional, subregional, and cellular levels. In this review article, we highlight the physiological properties of astrocytes and the implications for their function and influence of network and synaptic activity. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these differences in the context of optogenetic and DREADD experiments and consider whether these tools represent physiologically relevant techniques for the interrogation of astrocyte function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Retracing Schwann Cell Developmental Transitions in Embryonic Dissociated DRG/Schwann Cell Cocultures in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Embryonic Dissociated Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) cultures are often used to investigate the role of novel molecular pathways or drugs in Schwann cell development and myelination. These cultures largely recapitulate the order of cellular and molecular events that occur in Schwann cells of embryonic nerves. However, the timing of Schwann cell developmental transitions, notably the transition from Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP) to immature Schwann cells (iSC) and then to myelinating Schwann cells, has not been estimated so far in this culture system. In this study, we determined the expression profiles of Schwann cell developmental genes during the first week of culture and then compared our data to the expression profiles of these genes in developing spinal nerves. This helped in identifying that SCP transition into iSC between the 5th and 7th day in vitro. Furthermore, we also investigated the transition of immature cells into pro-myelinating and myelinating Schwann cells upon the induction of myelination in vitro. Our results suggest that Schwann cell differentiation beyond the immature stage can be observed as early as 4 days post the induction of myelination in cocultures. Finally, we compared the myelinating potential of coculture-derived Schwann cell monocultures to cultures established from neonatal sciatic nerves and found that both these culture systems exhibit similar myelinating phenotypes. In effect, our results allow for a better understanding and interpretation of coculture experiments especially in studies that aim to elucidate the role of a novel actor in Schwann cell development and myelination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Local Accumulation of Axonal Mitochondria in the Optic Nerve Glial Lamina Precedes Myelination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are essential for neurons and must be optimally distributed along their axon to fulfill local functions. A high density of mitochondria has been observed in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of an unmyelinated region of the optic nerve, called the glial lamina (GL) in mouse (lamina cribrosa in human). In glaucoma, the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness, the GL is the epicenter of RGC degeneration and is connected to mitochondrial dysfunction. It is generally accepted that the local accumulation of mitochondria in the GL is established due to the higher energy requirement of unmyelinated axons. Here we revisit the connection between mitochondrial positioning and myelin in RGC axons. We show that the high density of mitochondria in the GL is restricted to larger axons and is established before myelination. Thus, contrary to a longstanding belief in the field, the myelination pattern is not responsible for the establishment of the local accumulation of mitochondria in GL axons. Our findings open new research avenues likely critical to understanding the pathophysiology of glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: PTEN Expression Regulates Gap Junction Connectivity in the Retina</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) pathway has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to treat or prevent vision loss due to retinal disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of deleting one copy of Pten in a well-characterized class of retinal ganglion cells called α-ganglion cells in the mouse retina. In Pten&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; retinas, α-ganglion cells did not exhibit major changes in their dendritic structure, although most cells developed a few, unusual loop-forming dendrites. By contrast, α-ganglion cells exhibited a significant decrease in heterologous and homologous gap junction mediated cell coupling with other retinal ganglion and amacrine cells. Additionally, the majority of OFF α-ganglion cells (12/18 cells) formed novel coupling to displaced amacrine cells. The number of connexin36 puncta, the predominant connexin that mediates gap junction communication at electrical synapses, was decreased by at least 50% on OFF α-ganglion cells. Reduced and incorrect gap junction connectivity of α-ganglion cells will affect their functional properties and alter visual image processing in the retina. The anomalous connectivity of retinal ganglion cells would potentially limit future therapeutic approaches involving manipulation of the Pten pathway for treating ganglion cell degeneration in diseases like glaucoma, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for assessing idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) must be determined. This prospective study aimed to reveal the correlation between CSF biomarkers and clinical symptoms of iNPH and the predictive value of these biomarkers for tap test responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-nine patients with suspected iNPH were recruited, contributed qualified CSF, and underwent a tap test and unified pre- and post-test evaluations of the neurological function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The analysis of biomarkers from the patients’ CSF showed decreased levels of tau and its phosphorylated form, especially in the tap test (+) group. The responsiveness of the tap test was also related to the number of combined symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and a correlation was found between the end pressure or pressure difference in CSF and tap test responsiveness (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that P (tap test responsiveness) = 1/1 + e&lt;sup&gt;∧&lt;/sup&gt; − (−5.505 + 55.314 * ratio of p/T-tau − 1.586 * numbers of combined symptoms). The combined indicators (−5.505 + 0.553 * percentage of p/T-tau − 1.586 * numbers of combined symptoms) resulted in the highest sensitivity and specificity of 94.12% and 72.73%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: CSF biomarkers may be assessed to judge tap test responsiveness, which is beneficial for the feasibility of a clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The prevailing model for the variety in drug responses is that they stabilize distinct active states of their G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targets, allowing coupling to different effectors. However, whether the same ligand generates different GPCR active states based on the immediate environment of receptors is not known. Here we address this question using spatially resolved imaging of conformational biosensors that read out distinct active conformations of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), a physiologically relevant GPCR localized to Golgi and the surface in neuronal cells. We show that Golgi and surface pools of DOR both inhibit cAMP, but engage distinct conformational biosensors in response to the same ligand in rat neuroendocrine cells. Further, DOR recruits arrestins on the surface but not the Golgi. Our results suggest that the local environment determines the active states of receptors for any given drug, allowing GPCRs to couple to different effectors at different subcellular locations.</description>

	<description>Progress in science requires standardized assays whose results can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here, we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.</description>

	<title>eLife: An evolutionary model identifies the main evolutionary biases for the evolution of genome-replication profiles</title>

	<description>Recent results comparing the temporal program of genome replication of yeast species belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Lachancea&lt;/i&gt; clade support the scenario that the evolution of replication timing program could be mainly driven by correlated acquisition and loss events of active replication origins. Using these results as a benchmark, we develop an evolutionary model defined as birth-death process for replication origins, and use it to identify the evolutionary biases that shape the replication timing profiles. Comparing different evolutionary models with data, we find that replication origin birth and death events are mainly driven by two evolutionary pressures, the first imposes that events leading to higher double-stall probability of replication forks are penalized, while the second makes less efficient origins more prone to evolutionary loss. This analysis provides an empirically grounded predictive framework for quantitative evolutionary studies of the replication timing program.</description>

	<description>Mosaic inactivation of &lt;i&gt;CCM2 &lt;/i&gt;in humans causes cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) containing adjacent dilated blood-filled multi-cavernous lesions. We used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to induce mosaic inactivation of zebrafish&lt;i&gt; ccm2 &lt;/i&gt;resulting in a novel lethal multi-cavernous lesion in the embryonic caudal venous plexus (CVP) caused by obstruction of blood flow by intraluminal pillars. These pillars mimic those that mediate intussusceptive angiogenesis; however, in contrast to the normal process, the pillars failed to fuse to split the pre-existing vessel in two. Abortive intussusceptive angiogenesis stemmed from mosaic inactivation of &lt;i&gt;ccm2 &lt;/i&gt;leading to patchy &lt;i&gt;klf2a &lt;/i&gt;over-expression and resultant aberrant flow signaling. Surviving adult fish manifested histologically-typical hemorrhagic CCM. Formation of mammalian CCM requires the flow-regulated transcription factor KLF2; fish CCM and the embryonic CVP lesion failed to form in &lt;i&gt;klf2a &lt;/i&gt;null fish indicating a common pathogenesis with the mammalian lesion. These studies describe a zebrafish CCM model and establish a mechanism that can explain the formation of characteristic multi-cavernous lesions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cell-scale biophysical determinants of cell competition in epithelia</title>

	<description>How cells with different genetic makeups compete in tissues is an outstanding question in developmental biology and cancer research. Studies in recent years have revealed that cell competition can either be driven by short-range biochemical signalling or by long-range mechanical stresses in the tissue. To date, cell competition has generally been characterised at the population scale, leaving the single-cell-level mechanisms of competition elusive. Here, we use high time-resolution experimental data to construct a multi-scale agent-based model for epithelial cell competition and use it to gain a conceptual understanding of the cellular factors that governs competition in cell populations within tissues. We find that a key determinant of mechanical competition is the difference in homeostatic density between winners and losers, while differences in growth rates and tissue organisation do not affect competition end result. In contrast, the outcome and kinetics of biochemical competition is strongly influenced by local tissue organisation. Indeed, when loser cells are homogenously mixed with winners at the onset of competition, they are eradicated; however, when they are spatially separated, winner and loser cells coexist for long times. These findings suggest distinct biophysical origins for mechanical and biochemical modes of cell competition.</description>

	<title>eLife: Somatostatin-expressing parafacial neurons are CO2/H+ sensitive and regulate baseline breathing</title>

	<description>Glutamatergic neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating breathing in response to tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The RTN and greater parafacial region may also function as a chemosensing network composed of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions. In the context of disease, we showed that loss of inhibitory neural activity in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome disinhibited RTN chemoreceptors and destabilized breathing (Kuo et. al., 2019; 25). Despite this, contributions of parafacial inhibitory neurons to control of breathing are unknown, and synaptic properties of RTN neurons have not been characterized. Here, we show the parafacial region contains a limited diversity of inhibitory neurons including somatostatin (&lt;i&gt;Sst&lt;/i&gt;)-, parvalbumin (&lt;i&gt;Pvalb&lt;/i&gt;)- and cholecystokinin (&lt;i&gt;Cck&lt;/i&gt;)-expressing neurons. Of these, Sst-expressing interneurons appear uniquely inhibited by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. We also show RTN chemoreceptors receive inhibitory input that is withdrawn in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, and chemogenetic suppression of &lt;i&gt;Sst+&lt;/i&gt; parafacial neurons, but not &lt;i&gt;Pvalb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;+&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Cck&lt;/i&gt;+ neurons, increases baseline breathing. These results suggest &lt;i&gt;Sst&lt;/i&gt;-expressing parafacial neurons contribute to RTN chemoreception and respiratory activity.</description>

	<description>Peri‐stimulus time histograms of multiunit activity on attend‐toward (red) and attend‐away (blue) trials of the attention task. Multiunits from the same channel were sorted at low, medium, and high thresholds. Gray shading illustrates the data analysis window.







Abstract
Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic model of nutrient uptake explains dichotomy between marine oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Noele Norris, Naomi M. Levine, Vicente I. Fernandez, Roman Stocker&lt;/p&gt;

Marine bacterial diversity is immense and believed to be driven in part by trade-offs in metabolic strategies. Here we consider heterotrophs that rely on organic carbon as an energy source and present a molecular-level model of cell metabolism that explains the dichotomy between copiotrophs—which dominate in carbon-rich environments—and oligotrophs—which dominate in carbon-poor environments—as the consequence of trade-offs between nutrient transport systems. While prototypical copiotrophs, like &lt;i&gt;Vibrios&lt;/i&gt;, possess numerous phosphotransferase systems (PTS), prototypical oligotrophs, such as SAR11, lack PTS and rely on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which use binding proteins. We develop models of both transport systems and use them in proteome allocation problems to predict the optimal nutrient uptake and metabolic strategy as a function of carbon availability. We derive a Michaelis–Menten approximation of ABC transport, analytically demonstrating how the half-saturation concentration is a function of binding protein abundance. We predict that oligotrophs can attain nanomolar half-saturation concentrations using binding proteins with only micromolar dissociation constants and while closely matching transport and metabolic capacities. However, our model predicts that this requires large periplasms and that the slow diffusion of the binding proteins limits uptake. Thus, binding proteins are critical for oligotrophic survival yet severely constrain growth rates. We propose that this trade-off fundamentally shaped the divergent evolution of oligotrophs and copiotrophs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XaITgSK02Sw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sensory modulation of gait characteristics in human locomotion: A neuromusculoskeletal modeling study</title>

The central nervous system of humans and other animals modulates spinal cord activity to achieve several locomotion behaviors. Previous neuromechanical models investigated the modulation of human gait changing selected parameters belonging to CPGs (Central Pattern Generators) feedforward oscillatory structures or to feedback reflex circuits. CPG-based models could replicate slow and fast walking by changing only the oscillation’s properties. On the other hand, reflex-based models could achieve different behaviors through optimizations of large dimensional parameter spaces. However, they could not effectively identify individual key reflex parameters responsible for gait characteristics’ modulation. This study investigates which reflex parameters modulate the gait characteristics through neuromechanical simulations. A recently developed reflex-based model is used to perform optimizations with different target behaviors on speed, step length, and step duration to analyze the correlation between reflex parameters and their influence on these gait characteristics. We identified nine key parameters that may affect the target speed ranging from slow to fast walking (0.48 and 1.71 m/s) as well as a large range of step lengths (0.43 and 0.88 m) and step duration (0.51, 0.98 s). The findings show that specific reflexes during stance significantly affect step length regulation, mainly given by positive force feedback of the ankle plantarflexors’ group. On the other hand, stretch reflexes active during swing of iliopsoas and gluteus maximus regulate all the gait characteristics under analysis. Additionally, the results show that the hamstrings’ group’s stretch reflex during the landing phase is responsible for modulating the step length and step duration. Additional validation studies in simulations demonstrated that the modulation of identified reflexes is sufficient to regulate the investigated gait characteristics. Thus, this study provides an overview of possible reflexes involved in modulating speed, step length, and step duration of human gaits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/crkSx4K-c9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A recent study shows that programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) on activated T cells promotes their conversion to suppressive inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs), preferentially from among memory T cells. This new mechanism may normally protect against autoimmunity but is dysregulated in rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zinTaIHEu4Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Protected areas are the flagship management tools to secure biodiversity from anthropogenic impacts. However, the extent to which adjacent areas with distinct protection levels host different species numbers and compositions remains uncertain. Here, using reef fishes, European alpine plants, and North American birds, we show that the composition of species in adjacent Strictly Protected, Restricted, and Non-Protected areas is highly dissimilar, whereas the number of species is similar, after controlling for environmental conditions, sample size, and rarity. We find that between 12% and 15% of species are only recorded in Non-Protected areas, suggesting that a non-negligible part of regional biodiversity occurs where human activities are less regulated. For imperiled species, the proportion only recorded in Strictly Protected areas reaches 58% for fishes, 11% for birds, and 7% for plants, highlighting the fundamental and unique role of protected areas and their environmental conditions in biodiversity conservation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMx7Ri4DYdU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As a part of growing up, immature orangutans must acquire vast repertoires of skills and knowledge, a process that takes several years of observational social learning and subsequent practice. Adult female and male orangutans show behavioral differences including sex-specific foraging patterns and male-biased dispersal. We investigated how these differing life trajectories affect social interest and emerging ecological knowledge in immatures. We analyzed 15 years of detailed observational data on social learning, associations, and diet repertoires of 50 immatures (16 females and 34 males), from 2 orangutan populations. Specific to the feeding context, we found sex differences in the development of social interest: Throughout the dependency period, immature females direct most of their social attention at their mothers, whereas immature males show an increasing attentional preference for individuals other than their mothers. When attending to non-mother individuals, males show a significant bias toward immigrant individuals and a trend for a bias toward adult males. In contrast, females preferentially attend to neighboring residents. Accordingly, by the end of the dependency period, immature females show a larger dietary overlap with their mothers than do immature males. These results suggest that immature orangutans show attentional biases through which they learn from individuals with the most relevant ecological knowledge. Diversifying their skills and knowledge likely helps males when they move to a new area. In sum, our findings underline the importance of fine-grained social inputs for the acquisition of ecological knowledge and skills in orangutans and likely in other apes as well.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CYdfs1p74LI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Meta-analysis of variation suggests that embracing variability improves both replicability and generalizability in preclinical research</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuji Usui, Malcolm R. Macleod, Sarah K. McCann, Alistair M. Senior, Shinichi Nakagawa&lt;/p&gt;

The replicability of research results has been a cause of increasing concern to the scientific community. The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets replicability has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that cannot be replicated. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity, known as “heterogenization” of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke. First, by quantifying interindividual variability across control groups, we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve replicability by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e., low interindividual variability), as well as those where there is high interindividual variability in response; for these, latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimize variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift toward heterogenization and improve both the replicability and generalizability of preclinical research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Cqv0I8hcBks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NN) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NN are more densely packed in the upper layers (I‐III) and more sparsely distributed in layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with NADPHd histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Parafacial neurons in the human brainstem express specific markers for neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>

	<description>Relying on duplex in situ hybridization, targeting PPGAL (pre‐pro‐galanin) and SLC17A6 mRNAs, neurons of the human retrotrapezoid nucleus were identified within the parafacial region of the brainstem. NeuromedinB (NMB), suggested as being a specific marker of RTN neurons in mice by others, was not convincing in our anatomical study, but could benefit from more thorough investigations.







ABSTRACT
The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a hub for respiratory chemoregulation in the mammal brainstem that integrates chemosensory information from peripheral sites and central relays. Chemosensitive neurons of the RTN express specific genetic and molecular determinants which have been used to identify RTN precise location within the brainstem of rodents and non‐human primates. Based on a comparative approach, we hypothesized that among mammals, neurons exhibiting the same specific molecular and genetic signature would have the same function. The co‐expression of preprogalanin (PPGAL) and SLC17A6 (VGluT2) mRNAs with duplex in situ hybridization has been studied in formalin fixed paraffin‐embedded postmortem human brainstems. Two specimens were processed and analyzed in line with RTN descriptions in adult rats and macaques. Double‐labeled PPGAL+/SLC17A6+ neurons were only identified in the parafacial region of the brainstem. These neurons were found surrounding the nucleus of the facial nerve, located ventrally to the nucleus VII on caudal sections, and slightly more dorsally on rostral sections. The expression of neuromedin B (NMB) mRNA as a single marker of chemosensitive RTN neurons has not been confirmed in humans.
The location of the RTN in human adults is provided. This should help to develop investigation tools combining anatomic high‐resolution imaging and respiratory functional investigations to explore the pathogenic role of the RTN in congenital or acquired neurodegenerative diseases.

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dopamine Neurons That Cotransmit Glutamate, From Synapses to Circuits to Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.665386</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Discovered just over 20 years ago, dopamine neurons have the ability to cotransmit both dopamine and glutamate. Yet, the functional roles of dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission and their implications for therapeutic use are just emerging. This review article encompasses the current body of evidence investigating the functions of dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain that cotransmit glutamate. Since its discovery in dopamine neuron cultures, further work in vivo confirmed dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission across species. From there, growing interest has led to research related to neural functioning including roles in synaptic signaling, development, and behavior. Functional connectome mapping reveals robust connections in multiple forebrain regions to various cell types, most notably to cholinergic interneurons in both the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens and the lateral dorsal striatum. Glutamate markers in dopamine neurons reach peak levels during embryonic development and increase in response to various toxins, suggesting dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission may serve neuroprotective roles. Findings from behavioral analyses reveal prominent roles for dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission in responses to psychostimulants, in positive valence and cognitive systems and for subtle roles in negative valence systems. Insight into dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission informs the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, schizophrenia and Parkinson Disease, with therapeutic implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Regulatory Mechanisms of the RNA Modification m6A and Significance in Brain Function in Health and Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;RNA modifications have emerged as an additional layer of regulatory complexity governing the function of almost all species of RNA. N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), the addition of methyl groups to adenine residues, is the most abundant and well understood RNA modification. The current review discusses the regulatory mechanisms governing m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, how this influences neuronal development and function and how aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A signaling may contribute to neurological disease. M&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is known to regulate the stability of mRNA, the processing of microRNAs and function/processing of tRNAs among other roles. The development of antibodies against m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has facilitated the application of next generation sequencing to profile methylated RNAs in both health and disease contexts, revealing the extent of this transcriptomic modification. The mechanisms by which m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is deposited, processed, and potentially removed are increasingly understood. Writer enzymes include METTL3 and METTL14 while YTHDC1 and YTHDF1 are key reader proteins, which recognize and bind the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark. Finally, FTO and ALKBH5 have been identified as potential erasers of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, although there in vivo activity and the dynamic nature of this modification requires further study. M&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is enriched in the brain and has emerged as a key regulator of neuronal activity and function in processes including neurodevelopment, learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and the stress response. Changes to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A have recently been linked with Schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease. Elucidating the functional consequences of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A changes in these and other brain diseases may lead to novel insight into disease pathomechanisms, molecular biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Impaired Adaptation and Laminar Processing of the Oddball Paradigm in the Primary Visual Cortex of Fmr1 KO Mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both adaptation and novelty detection are an integral part of sensory processing. Recent animal oddball studies have advanced our understanding of circuitry underlying contextual processing in early sensory areas. However, it is unclear how adaptation and mismatch (MM) responses depend on the tuning properties of neurons and their laminar position. Furthermore, given that reduced habituation and sensory overload are among the hallmarks of altered sensory perception in autism, we investigated how oddball processing might be altered in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FX). Using silicon probe recordings and a novel spatial frequency (SF) oddball paradigm, we discovered that FX mice show reduced adaptation and enhanced MM responses compared to control animals. Specifically, we found that adaptation is primarily restricted to neurons with preferred oddball SF in FX compared to WT mice. Mismatch responses, on the other hand, are enriched in the superficial layers of WT animals but are present throughout lamina in FX animals. Last, we observed altered neural dynamics in FX mice in response to stimulus omissions. Taken together, we demonstrated that reduced feature adaptation coexists with impaired laminar processing of oddball responses, which might contribute to altered sensory perception in FX syndrome and autism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dynamic Changes of Arc Expression in Dorsal Striatum of Mice After Self-Administration of Sucrose</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Region-specific plasticity in the striatal circuit plays an important role in the development and long-term maintenance of skills and sequential movement procedures. Studies investigating the molecular substrates that contribute to the plasticity changes during motor skill processes have documented a transition in expression from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS); however, few studies have explored the expression pattern of molecular substrates in the dorsal striatum during progression of instrumental learning. To address this issue, the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expressions in the subregional dorsal striatum were analyzed during the early and late learning phases of the 10-day sucrose self-administration process. We found that Arc protein is primarily detected in the DMS only in the initial learning stage; however, it is expressed in the DLS during both early and late learning stages. Moreover, Arc expression in the DMS correlated with the number of rewards received later in the training. These data indicated that the Arc expression in subregions of the dorsal striatum shows region-specific transfer and that Arc expression in the DMS contributes to obtaining reward in later learning stage during the process of instrumental learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Delirium is a common serious complication that often occurs after major surgery. The goals of this study were to explore the expression profiles and functional networks of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in patients of postoperative delirium (POD). Microarray analysis was performed on the peripheral blood samples to identify differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs in 4 POD patients and 4 non-POD volunteers. DE lncRNAs and mRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify the critical biological functions and signaling pathways involved in POD. A total of 1195 DE lncRNAs and 735 DE mRNAs were identified between the POD and non-POD groups. Verified by the RT-qPCR, we identified 14 DE lncRNAs that may relate to the pathogenesis of POD. These 14 DE lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in “glutamate and 5-hydroxytryptamine,” “synaptotagmin 7,” “transient receptor potential channel,” “interleukin-2 production.” There was a regulatory relationship between lncRNA ENST00000530057 and synaptotagmin (Syt) 7 mRNA. The mRNA level of PCLO was up-regulated in POD group. This study showed abundant DE lncRNAs and mRNAs in POD that might help in deciphering the disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.655667</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of the study was to explore patterns of white matter (WM) alteration in preclinical stage familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seven asymptomatic carriers of the PRNP G114V mutation and six non-carriers were recruited from the same fCJD kindred and follow-up obtained from all asymptomatic carriers and two non-carriers 2 years later. Overlapping WM patterns were also explored in asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic CJD patients. All participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments and DTI at baseline and follow-up. DTI data were subjected to whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in WM using tract-based spatial statistics. Three comparisons were conducted: baseline carriers against non-carriers (baseline analysis), changes after 2 years in carriers (follow-up analysis), and differences between patients with symptomatic CJD and healthy controls (CJD patient analysis).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Neither carriers nor non-carriers developed any neurological symptoms during 2 years of follow-up. Baseline analysis showed no differences between the carrier and non-carrier groups in MD and FA. Follow-up analysis showed significantly increased MD in multiple WM tracts, among which increased MD in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral cingulate gyrus, and left uncinate fasciculus overlapped the patterns observed in patients with symptomatic CJD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Changes in integrity within multiple WM tracts can be detected during the preclinical stage of fCJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Language Impairment in Alzheimer’s Disease—Robust and Explainable Evidence for AD-Related Deterioration of Spontaneous Speech Through Multilingual Machine Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.642033</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.642033</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disease that affects millions worldwide and is most prominently associated with broad cognitive decline, including language impairment. Picture description tasks are routinely used to monitor language impairment in AD. Due to the high amount of manual resources needed for an in-depth analysis of thereby-produced spontaneous speech, advanced natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) represents a promising opportunity. In this applied research field though, NLP and ML methodology do not necessarily ensure robust clinically actionable insights into cognitive language impairment in AD and additional precautions must be taken to ensure clinical-validity and generalizability of results. In this study, we add generalizability through multilingual feature statistics to computational approaches for the detection of language impairment in AD. We include 154 participants (78 healthy subjects, 76 patients with AD) from two different languages (106 English speaking and 47 French speaking). Each participant completed a picture description task, in addition to a battery of neuropsychological tests. Each response was recorded and manually transcribed. From this, task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features are extracted using NLP resources. Using inferential statistics, we determined language features, excluding task specific features, that are significant in both languages and therefore represent “generalizable” signs for cognitive language impairment in AD. In a second step, we evaluated all features as well as the generalizable ones for English, French and both languages in a binary discrimination ML scenario (AD vs. healthy) using a variety of classifiers. The generalizable language feature set outperforms the all language feature set in English, French and the multilingual scenarios. Semantic features are the most generalizable while paralinguistic features show no overlap between languages. The multilingual model shows an equal distribution of error in both English and French. By leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach, we identify AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom. We find a primary impairment in semantics in addition to mild syntactic impairment, possibly confounded by additional impaired cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on the Affected Hemisphere Enhances Hand Functional Recovery in Subacute Adult Stroke Patients: A Randomized Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.636184</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.636184</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Either motor training or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could modulate the neural plasticity after stroke. Therefore, synchronizing the two interventions may optimize the efficiency of recovery. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of rTMS along with hand grip training on the neurobehavioral and hand functional recovery in one cohort of subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-nine stroke patients were enrolled in a single-center, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. We tested different intervention effects of rTMS and hand grip training (group A), rTMS alone (group B), and hand grip training alone (group C). For the rTMS-treated groups, patients received 10 consecutive sessions of 5-Hz stimulation over the affected hemisphere with 750 pulses. Jebsen–Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), grip strength, modified Barthel index (mBI), and ipsilesional motor evoked potential (iMEP) latency were assessed and compared across the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that only rTMS along with hand grip training group all improved in JTHFT, FMA-UE, grip strength, and mBI (p ≤ 0.01) compared with the baseline among the three groups. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that rTMS plus hand grip training had much better results in improvement of neurobehavioral outcomes compared to the rTMS alone- and hand grip training alone-treated patients (p &amp;lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were detected in neurophysiologic outcome between intra-groups and inter-groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These proof-of-concept results suggested that rTMS alone with hand grip training was a unique approach to promote hand functional recovery in stroke patients. It provided important information to design a large-scale multi-center clinical trial to further demonstrate the efficiency of the combination of central and peripheral stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn (#ChiCTR1900023443).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632448</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: CircRNAs have been found to play a crucial role in the pathological process of various kinds of diseases. However, the role of circRNAs in the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysm is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Differentially expressed circRNAs profiles between superficial temporal arteries (n = 5) and intracranial aneurysms (n = 5) were analyzed using the Arraystar human circRNAs microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to validate the differential expression of circDUS2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was meant for the location of circDUS2 in human brain vascular smooth muscle cell (HBVSMC). Structural analysis was used to speculate on the function of circDUS2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Five hundred forty-three upregulated and 397 downregulated significantly in intracranial aneurysm as compared to superficial temporal arteries. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the elevated expression of the upregulated circDUS2. The FISH test revealed that circDUS2 is located in the cytoplasm of brain vascular smooth muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study showed differential expression data of circRNAs between superficial temporal artery and intracranial aneurysm and revealed that circDUS2 is a potential molecular marker for intracranial aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides an opportunity to study gene expression at single-cell resolution. However, prevalent dropout events result in high data sparsity and noise that may obscure downstream analyses in single-cell transcriptomic studies. We propose a new method, G2S3, that imputes dropouts by borrowing information from adjacent genes in a sparse gene graph learned from gene expression profiles across cells. We applied G2S3 and ten existing imputation methods to eight single-cell transcriptomic datasets and compared their performance. Our results demonstrated that G2S3 has superior overall performance in recovering gene expression, identifying cell subtypes, reconstructing cell trajectories, identifying differentially expressed genes, and recovering gene regulatory and correlation relationships. Moreover, G2S3 is computationally efficient for imputation in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lOJnB7dMGks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The eukaryotic transcription cycle consists of three main steps: initiation, elongation, and cleavage of the nascent RNA transcript. Although each of these steps can be regulated as well as coupled with each other, their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dissection has remained challenging because available experimental readouts lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to separate the contributions from each of these steps. Here, we describe a novel application of Bayesian inference techniques to simultaneously infer the effective parameters of the transcription cycle in real time and at the single-cell level using a two-color MS2/PP7 reporter gene and the developing fruit fly embryo as a case study. Our method enables detailed investigations into cell-to-cell variability in transcription-cycle parameters as well as single-cell correlations between these parameters. These measurements, combined with theoretical modeling, suggest a substantial variability in the elongation rate of individual RNA polymerase molecules. We further illustrate the power of this technique by uncovering a novel mechanistic connection between RNA polymerase density and nascent RNA cleavage efficiency. Thus, our approach makes it possible to shed light on the regulatory mechanisms in play during each step of the transcription cycle in individual, living cells at high spatiotemporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UGmlFnge6Ac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Switches in brain states, synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation are fundamental processes in our brain that take place concomitantly across several spatial and timescales. All these processes target neuron intrinsic properties and connectivity to achieve specific physiological goals, raising the question of how they can operate without interfering with each other. Here, we highlight the central importance of a timescale separation in the activation of sodium and T-type calcium channels to sustain robust switches in brain states in thalamic neurons that are compatible with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. We quantify the role of this timescale separation by comparing the robustness of rhythms of six published conductance-based models at the cellular, circuit and network levels. We show that robust rhythm generation requires a T-type calcium channel activation whose kinetics are situated between sodium channel activation and T-type calcium channel inactivation in all models despite their quantitative differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mLucSWIdP_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) sequencing technologies allow us to investigate three-dimensional chromatin organization at the single-cell level. However, we still need computational tools to deal with the sparsity of the contact maps from single cells and embed single cells in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. This embedding helps us understand relationships between the cells in different dimensions, such as cell-cycle dynamics and cell differentiation. We present an open-source computational toolbox, scHiCTools, for analyzing single-cell Hi-C data comprehensively and efficiently. The toolbox provides two methods for screening single cells, three common methods for smoothing scHi-C data, three efficient methods for calculating the pairwise similarity of cells, three methods for embedding single cells, three methods for clustering cells, and a build-in function to visualize the cells embedding in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional plot. scHiCTools, written in Python3, is compatible with different platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9wL-tejoXPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mathematical modeling of multiple pathways in colorectal carcinogenesis using dynamical systems with Kronecker structure</title>

Like many other types of cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) develops through multiple pathways of carcinogenesis. This is also true for colorectal carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome (LS), the most common inherited CRC syndrome. However, a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of these pathways of carcinogenesis, which allows for tailored clinical treatment and even prevention, is still lacking. We suggest a linear dynamical system modeling the evolution of different pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis based on the involved driver mutations. The model consists of different components accounting for independent and dependent mutational processes. We define the driver gene mutation graphs and combine them using the Cartesian graph product. This leads to matrix components built by the Kronecker sum and product of the adjacency matrices of the gene mutation graphs enabling a thorough mathematical analysis and medical interpretation. Using the Kronecker structure, we developed a mathematical model which we applied exemplarily to the three pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis in LS. Beside a pathogenic germline variant in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, driver mutations in &lt;i&gt;APC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CTNNB1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; are considered. We exemplarily incorporate mutational dependencies, such as increased point mutation rates after MMR deficiency, and based on recent experimental data, biallelic somatic &lt;i&gt;CTNNB1&lt;/i&gt; mutations as common drivers of LS-associated CRCs. With the model and parameter choice, we obtained simulation results that are in concordance with clinical observations. These include the evolution of MMR-deficient crypts as early precursors in LS carcinogenesis and the influence of variants in MMR genes thereon. The proportions of MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient APC-inactivated crypts as first measure for the distribution among the pathways in LS-associated colorectal carcinogenesis are compatible with clinical observations. The approach provides a modular framework for modeling multiple pathways of carcinogenesis yielding promising results in concordance with clinical observations in LS CRCs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZamzTE52rw0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression represent different levels information in biological process, but a comprehensive multiomics analysis of the mammalian heart is lacking. Here, we applied nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing, which detected DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility simultaneously, as well as RNA-seq, for multiomics analysis of the 4 chambers of adult and fetal human hearts, and adult mouse hearts. Our results showed conserved region-specific patterns in the mammalian heart at transcriptome and DNA methylation level. Adult and fetal human hearts showed distinct features in DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptome. Novel long noncoding RNAs were identified in the human heart, and the gene expression profiles of major cardiovascular diseases associated genes were displayed. Furthermore, cross-species comparisons revealed human-specific and mouse-specific differentially expressed genes between the atria and ventricles. We also reported the relationship among multiomics and found there was a bell-shaped relationship between gene-body methylation and expression in the human heart. In general, our study provided comprehensive spatiotemporal and evolutionary insights into the regulation of gene expression in the heart.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/U06HjhHusnE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Preferential frequency‐dependent induction of synaptic depression by the lateral perforant path and of synaptic potentiation by the medial perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus</title>

	<description>Abstract
The encoding of spatial representations is enabled by synaptic plasticity. The entorhinal cortex sends information to the hippocampus via the lateral (LPP) and medial perforant (MPP) paths that transfer egocentric item‐related and allocentric spatial information, respectively. To what extent LPP and MPP information‐relay results in different homosynaptic synaptic plasticity responses is unclear. We examined the frequency dependency (at 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 Hz) of long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD) at MPP and LPP synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving adult rats. We report that whereas the MPP–DG synapses exhibit a predisposition toward the expression of LTP, LPP–DG synapses prefer to express synaptic depression. The divergence of synaptic plasticity responses is most prominent at afferent frequencies of 5, 100, Hz and 200 Hz. Priming with 10 or 50 Hz significantly modified the subsequent plasticity response in a frequency‐dependent manner, but failed to change the preferred direction of change in synaptic strength of MPP and LPP synapses. Evaluation of the expression of GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor revealed equivalent expression in the outer and middle thirds of the molecular layer where LPP and MPP inputs convene, respectively, thus excluding NMDA receptors as a substrate for the frequency‐dependent differences in bidirectional plasticity. These findings demonstrate that the LPP and MPP inputs to the DG enable differentiated and distinct forms of synaptic plasticity in response to the same afferent frequencies. Effects are extremely robust and resilient to metaplastic priming. These properties may support the functional differentiation of allocentric and item information provided to the DG by the MPP and LPP, respectively, that has been proposed by others. We propose that allocentric spatial information, conveyed by the MPP is encoded through hippocampal LTP in a designated synaptic network. This network is refined and optimized to include egocentric contextual information through LTD triggered by LPP inputs.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Decoding Spatial Memory Retrieval in Cubical Space Using fMRI Signals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The way spatial memory retrieval is represented in the brain remains unclear to date. Previous studies have displayed a hippocampus-centered navigation network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. There have been some studies on the representation of navigation behavior by signal distribution patterns, but only in the hippocampus and adjacent structures. In this study, we aimed to determine (1) the brain regions that represent information in both intensity and distribution patterns during spatial memory retrieval and (2) whether the patterns of neural responses represent spatial memory retrieval behavior performance. Both univariate analysis [general linear model (GLM)] and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) were employed to reveal the spatial distributions of brain responses elicited by spatial memory retrieval. Correlation analyses were performed to detect the correspondences between brain responses and behavior performance. We found that spatial memory retrieval occurred in widespread brain regions, including the bilateral hippocampi, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobules, bilateral occipital lobes, and cerebellum. The amplitude of activation in the left hippocampus showed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.46, p = 0.039) with the number of task completions. Additionally, within-subject classification accuracies based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal patterns of the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) rostral areas in the Brainnetome Atlas showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.78, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) with retrieval accuracy. In summary, our findings have implications for understanding the separation between navigational and non-navigational states and emphasizing the utility of MVPA in the whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Upregulation of lncRNA147410.3 in the Brain of Mice With Chronic Toxoplasma Infection Promoted Microglia Apoptosis by Regulating Hoxb3</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasma gondii is neurotropic and affects the function of nerve cells, while the mechanism is unclear. LncRNAs are abundantly enriched in the brain and participated in the delicate regulation of the central nervous system (CNS) development. However, whether these lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of microglia activation during the process of T. gondii infection is largely unknown. In this study, the upregulation of a novel lncRNA147410.3 (ENSMUST00000147410.3) was identified as a key factor to influence this process. The target gene of lncRNA147410.3 was predicted and identified as Hoxb3. The localization of lncRNA147410.3 in the brain and cells was proved in the nucleus of neuroglia through FISH assay. Furthermore, the function of lncRNA147410.3 on neuronal cell was confirmed that lncRNA147410.3 could affect proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of mouse microglia by positively regulating Hoxb3. Thus, our study explored the modulatory action of lncRNA147410.3 in T. gondii infected mouse brain, providing a scientific basis for using lncRNA147410.3 as a therapeutic target to treat neurological disorder induced by T. gondii.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genomewide Association Studies of LRRK2 Modifiers of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26094</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26094?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genomewide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genomewide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; p value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genomewide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these 2 proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: p value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: p value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 cause syndromic infantile encephalopathy and hypopituitarism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26127</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Post mortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Derek Reiman, Brian T. Layden, Yang Dai&lt;/p&gt;

The advance in microbiome and metabolome studies has generated rich omics data revealing the involvement of the microbial community in host disease pathogenesis through interactions with their host at a metabolic level. However, the computational tools to uncover these relationships are just emerging. Here, we present MiMeNet, a neural network framework for modeling microbe-metabolite relationships. Using ten iterations of 10-fold cross-validation on three paired microbiome-metabolome datasets, we show that MiMeNet more accurately predicts metabolite abundances (mean Spearman correlation coefficients increase from 0.108 to 0.309, 0.276 to 0.457, and -0.272 to 0.264) and identifies more well-predicted metabolites (increase in the number of well-predicted metabolites from 198 to 366, 104 to 143, and 4 to 29) compared to state-of-art linear models for individual metabolite predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that MiMeNet can group microbes and metabolites with similar interaction patterns and functions to illuminate the underlying structure of the microbe-metabolite interaction network, which could potentially shed light on uncharacterized metabolites through “Guilt by Association”. Our results demonstrated that MiMeNet is a powerful tool to provide insights into the causes of metabolic dysregulation in disease, facilitating future hypothesis generation at the interface of the microbiome and metabolomics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QTOsI_TZDDI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Stroke is a debilitating condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The development of improved rehabilitation therapies rests on finding biomarkers suitable for tracking functional damage and recovery. To achieve this goal, we perform a spatiotemporal analysis of cortical activity obtained by wide-field calcium images in mice before and after stroke. We compare spontaneous recovery with three different post-stroke rehabilitation paradigms, motor training alone, pharmacological contralesional inactivation and both combined. We identify three novel indicators that are able to track how movement-evoked global activation patterns are impaired by stroke and evolve during rehabilitation: the duration, the smoothness, and the angle of individual propagation events. Results show that, compared to pre-stroke conditions, propagation of cortical activity in the subacute phase right after stroke is slowed down and more irregular. When comparing rehabilitation paradigms, we find that mice treated with both motor training and pharmacological intervention, the only group associated with generalized recovery, manifest new propagation patterns, that are even faster and smoother than before the stroke. In conclusion, our new spatiotemporal propagation indicators could represent promising biomarkers that are able to uncover neural correlates not only of motor deficits caused by stroke but also of functional recovery during rehabilitation. In turn, these insights could pave the way towards more targeted post-stroke therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V5KSb5K32lA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ventricular, atrial, and outflow tract heart progenitors arise from spatially and molecularly distinct regions of the primitive streak</title>

The heart develops from 2 sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first and second heart field (FHF and SHF). Using a single-cell transcriptomic assay combined with genetic lineage tracing and live imaging, we find the FHF and SHF are subdivided into distinct pools of progenitors in gastrulating mouse embryos at earlier stages than previously thought. Each subpopulation has a distinct origin in the primitive streak. The first progenitors to leave the primitive streak contribute to the left ventricle, shortly after right ventricle progenitor emigrate, followed by the outflow tract and atrial progenitors. Moreover, a subset of atrial progenitors are gradually incorporated in posterior locations of the FHF. Although cells allocated to the outflow tract and atrium leave the primitive streak at a similar stage, they arise from different regions. Outflow tract cells originate from distal locations in the primitive streak while atrial progenitors are positioned more proximally. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrates that the primitive streak cells contributing to the ventricles have a distinct molecular signature from those forming the outflow tract and atrium. We conclude that cardiac progenitors are prepatterned within the primitive streak and this prefigures their allocation to distinct anatomical structures of the heart. Together, our data provide a new molecular and spatial map of mammalian cardiac progenitors that will support future studies of heart development, function, and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kpRtFzPPbgg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Encephalitis with Autoantibodies against the Glutamate Kainate Receptors GluK2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26098</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26098?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The objective of this study was to report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2 of 8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both, the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immuno‐absorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis, which in 2 patients caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 patients had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors [AMPAR] and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors [NMDAR]) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinicoradiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>A laser speckle contrast image showing blood flow in the face of a migraineur who had received an infusion of pramlinitide, an agonist for amylin receptors. Amylin is a peptide in the same family as CGRP, with which it shares agonist activity at the AMY1 receptor. Amylin can also provoke migraine‐like attacks, suggesting that an dual amylin‐CGRP antagonist may be effective for migraine. See Ghanizada et al. (pp. 1157–1171) in this issue.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain Predict Phenoconversion of Pure Autonomic Failure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26089</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26089?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n = 32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. Five patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but two cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in five samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls and relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), quality of life, and brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients and controls but did not differ between RRMS and progressive MS or differ based on disease‐modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by body mass index, race, and sex. In both progressive MS and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCMM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17–producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
Whereas some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1195–1211</description>

	<description>Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multimodality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable, although neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1068–1079</description>

	<description>Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, and ganglioglioma. Here, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. In 3 of 12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1248–1252</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Unravelling the Neural Basis of Spatial Delusions After Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26079</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26079?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (ie, reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case‐control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders. Second, we built a multivariate logistic model, including clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%), and chimeric assimilation (13%). Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included 2 distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipitotemporal structures. In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age, and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80 [0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomic circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia. This novel data may contribute to better understand the pathophysiology of delusional syndromes after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1181–1194</description>

	<description>There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality and comparability, hence the understanding of the spectrum, burden, and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the World Health Organization, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonized clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and neurological complications, with standardized forms for pooled data analyses that nonspecialists can use, including those in low‐income settings.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the Insular Role in Cardiac Function through Intracranial Electrical Stimulation of the Human Insula</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26074</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26074?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The link between brain function and cardiovascular dynamics is an important issue yet to be elucidated completely. The insula is a neocortical brain area that is thought to have a cardiac chronotropic regulatory function, but its role in cardiac contractility is unknown. We aimed to analyze the variability in heart rate and cardiac contractility after functional activation of different insular regions through direct electrical stimulation (E‐stim) in humans.


Methods
This was an observational, prospective study, including patients admitted for stereo‐electroencephalographic recording because of refractory epilepsy, in whom the insular cortex was implanted. Patients with anatomical or electrophysiological insular abnormalities and those in whom E‐stim produced subjective symptoms were excluded. Variations in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed during insular E‐stim and compared with control E‐stim of non‐eloquent brain regions and sham stimulations.


Results
Ten patients were included, 5 implanted in the right insula (52 E‐stim) and 5 in the left (37 E‐stim). Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. E‐stim of both right and left insulas induced a significant decrease of the CO and HR, and an increase of the SV. E‐stim of control electrodes and sham stimulations were not associated with variations in cardiac function. Blood pressure and respiratory rate remained unaltered.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a direct chronotropic and inotropic cardiac depressor function of the right and left insulas. The evidence of an insular direct cardiac regulatory function might open a path in the prevention or treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Amylin Analog Pramlintide Induces Migraine‐like Attacks in Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26072</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26072?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood, and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP).


Methods
Thirty‐six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blind, 2‐way, crossover, positive‐controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on 2 different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat, mouse and human tissue samples were conducted.


Results
Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to 33 (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine‐like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to 19 patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide‐induced migraine‐like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters. Human receptor pharmacology studies showed that an amylin receptor likely mediates these pramlintide‐provoked effects, rather than the canonical CGRP receptor. Supporting this, preclinical experiments investigating symptoms associated with migraine showed that amylin treatment, like CGRP, caused cutaneous hypersensitivity and light aversion in mice.


Interpretation
Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NIA‐AA Alzheimer's Disease Framework: Clinical Characterization of Stages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26071</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26071?af=R</link>
	<description>Background
To operationalize the National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) Research Framework for Alzheimer's Disease 6‐stage continuum of clinical progression for persons with abnormal amyloid.


Methods
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a population‐based longitudinal study of aging and cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated persons without dementia having 3 consecutive clinical visits. Measures for cross‐sectional categories included objective cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective cognitive change (ΔOBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral symptoms (ΔNBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages using different cutoff points and assessed stability of the stages over 15 months.


Results
Among 243 abnormal amyloid participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66 to 90% were classified as stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24 to 36% were stage 1, 32 to 47% were stage 2, 18 to 27% were stage 3, 1 to 3% were stage 4 to 6, and 3 to 9% were indeterminate. Most stage 2 participants were classified as stage 2 because of abnormal ΔOBJ only (44–59%), whereas 11 to 21% had SCD only, and 9 to 13% had ΔNBS only. Short‐term stability varied by stage and OBJ cutoff points but the most notable changes were seen in stage 2 with 38 to 63% remaining stable, 4 to 13% worsening, and 24 to 41% improving (moving to stage 1).


Interpretation
The frequency of the stages varied by age and the precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it can be adopted for clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1145–1156</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Meningeal CGRP‐Prolactin Interaction Evokes Female‐Specific Migraine Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26070</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26070?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1129–1144</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Staufen1 in Human Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26069</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26069?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Mutations in the ATXN2 gene (CAG expansions ≥32 repeats) can be a rare cause of Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently reported that the stress granule (SG) protein Staufen1 (STAU1) was overabundant in neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patient cells, animal models, and ALS‐TDP‐43 fibroblasts, and provided a link between SG formation and autophagy. We aimed to test if STAU1 overabundance has a role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.


Methods
With multiple neurodegenerative patient‐derived cell models, animal models, and human postmortem ALS tissue, we evaluate STAU1 function using biochemical and immunohistological analyses.


Results
We demonstrate STAU1 overabundance and increased total and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in fibroblast cells from patients with ALS with mutations in TDP‐43, patients with dementia with PSEN1 mutations, a patient with parkinsonism with MAPT mutation, Huntington's disease (HD) mutations, and SCA2 mutations. Increased STAU1 levels and mTOR activity were seen in human ALS spinal cord tissues as well as in animal models. Changes in STAU1 and mTOR protein levels were post‐transcriptional. Exogenous expression of STAU1 in wildtype cells was sufficient to activate mTOR and downstream targets and form SGs. Targeting STAU1 by RNAi normalized mTOR, suggesting a potential role for therapy in diseases associated with STAU1 overabundance.


Interpretation
STAU1 overabundance in neurodegeneration is a common phenomenon associated with hyperactive mTOR. Targeting STAU1 with ASOs or miRNA viral vectors may represent a novel, efficacious therapy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overabundant STAU1.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: How Can an Na+ Channel Inhibitor Ameliorate Seizures in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26068</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1099–1113</description>

	<description>Risk factors for developing dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) probably differ between MCI subtypes. We investigated how frailty relates to dementia risk in amnestic MCI (a‐MCI; n = 2,799) and non‐amnestic MCI (na‐MCI; n = 629) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Although higher frailty increased dementia risk for people with either a‐MCI or na‐MCI, the larger risk was in na‐MCI (interaction hazard ratio = 1.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.59], p &amp;lt; 0.001). Even after the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment, poor general health, quantified by a high degree of frailty, is a significant risk for dementia.

	<description>A rapidly expanding catalog of neurogenetic disorders has encouraged a diagnostic shift towards early clinical whole exome sequencing (WES). Adult primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) frequently exhibit neurological manifestations that overlap with other nervous system disorders. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not routinely analyzed in standard clinical WES bioinformatic pipelines. We reanalyzed 11,424 exomes, enriched with neurological diseases, for pathogenic mtDNA variants. Twenty‐four different mtDNA mutations were detected in 64 exomes, 11 of which were considered disease causing based on the associated clinical phenotypes. These findings highlight the diagnostic uplifts gained by analyzing mtDNA from WES data in neurological diseases. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1240–1247</description>

	<description>Although Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS), up to 15% of children with a diagnosis of MS were reported to be EBV‐seronegative. When re‐evaluating 25 EBV‐seronegative children out of 189 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome/MS, we found anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody in 11 of 25 (44%) EBV‐seronegative but only 9 of 164 (5.5%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) EBV‐seropositive patients. After critical review, MS remained a plausible diagnosis in only 4 of 14 EBV‐seronegative/MOG antibody–negative patients. In children with an MS‐like presentation, EBV seronegativity should alert clinicians to consider diagnoses other than MS, especially MOG‐antibody disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1234–1239</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Long‐Term Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Aquaporin‐4 IgG‐Positive NMOSD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26049</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26049?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose = 1,200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 weeks (5.1–276.9 weeks), for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5 in 100 PY and 8.6 in 100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2 in 100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1 in 100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI = 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI = 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44 of 119 patients) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1088–1098</description>

	<description>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control subject and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS through future prospective research.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cannabinoid Signaling in Auditory Function and Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678510</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678510</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plants of the genus Cannabis have been used by humans for millennia for a variety of purposes. Perhaps most notable is the use of certain Cannabis strains for their psychoactive effects. More recently, several biologically active molecules within the plants of these Cannabis strains, called phytocannabinoids or simply cannabinoids, have been identified. Furthermore, within human cells, endogenous cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids, as well as the receptors and secondary messengers that give rise to their neuromodulatory effects, have also been characterized. This endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of two primary ligands—anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol; two primary receptors—cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2; and several enzymes involved in biosynthesis and degradation of endocannabinoid ligands including diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Here we briefly summarize cannabinoid signaling and review what has been discerned to date with regard to cannabinoid signaling in the auditory system and its roles in normal physiological function as well as pathological conditions. While much has been uncovered regarding cannabinoid signaling in the central nervous system, less attention has been paid to the auditory system specifically. Still, evidence is emerging to suggest that cannabinoid signaling is critical for the development, maturation, function, and survival of cochlear hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Furthermore, cannabinoid signaling can have profound effects on synaptic connectivity in CNS structures related to auditory processing. While clinical cases demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids impact auditory function, this review highlights several areas, such as SGN development, where more research is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Role of Cellular Calcium Disorder in Varicella Zoster Virus-Induced Post-Herpetic Neuralgia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.665931</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a typical neuropathic pain, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster (HZ), which seriously affects the normal life and work of patients. The unclear pathogenesis and lack of effective drugs make the clinical efficacy of PHN unsatisfactory. Here, we obtained the transcriptome profile of neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and DRG in rats infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with publicly available gene array data sets. Next, the data processing of the transcriptome map was analyzed using bioinformatics methods, including the screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Finally, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of calcium-related genes, and calcium fluorescent probes and calcium colorimetry were used to evaluate the distribution and content of calcium ions in cells after VZV infection. Transcriptome data analysis (GO and KEGG enrichment analysis) showed that calcium disorder played an important role in SH-SY5Y cells infected by VZV and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the PHN rat model. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of calcium-related genes BHLHA15, CACNA1F, CACNG1, CHRNA9, and STC2 were significantly upregulated, while the expression levels of CHRNA10, HRC, and TNNT3 were significantly downregulated in SH-SY5Y cells infected with VZV. Our calcium fluorescent probe and calcium colorimetric test results showed that VZV could change the distribution of calcium ions in infected cells and significantly increase the intracellular calcium content. In conclusion, our results revealed that the persistence of calcium disorder caused by VZV in nerve cells might be a crucial cause of herpetic neuralgia, and a potential target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of PHN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Single-Nucleus Chromatin Accessibility Landscape Reveals Diversity in Regulatory Regions Across Distinct Adult Rat Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.651355</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rats have been widely used as an experimental organism in psychological, pharmacological, and behavioral studies by modeling human diseases such as neurological disorders. It is critical to identify and characterize cell fate determinants and their regulatory mechanisms in single-cell resolutions across rat brain regions. Here, we applied droplet-based single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) to systematically profile the single-cell chromatin accessibility across four dissected brain areas in adult Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats with a total of 59,023 single nuclei and identified 16 distinct cell types. Interestingly, we found that different cortex regions exhibit diversity in both cellular compositions and gene regulatory regions. Several cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs), including SPI1, KLF4, KLF6, and NEUROD2, have been shown to play important roles during the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), astrocytic gliomas, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, our single-nucleus atlas of rat cortex could serve as an invaluable resource for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse cortex cell fates and further revealing the regulatory networks of neuropathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Photoacoustic Mouse Brain Imaging Using an Optical Fabry-Pérot Interferometric Ultrasound Sensor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photoacoustic (PA, or optoacoustic, OA) mesoscopy is a powerful tool for mouse cerebral imaging, which offers high resolution three-dimensional (3D) images with optical absorption contrast inside the optically turbid brain. The image quality of a PA mesoscope relies on the ultrasonic transducer which detects the PA signals. An all-optical ultrasound sensor based on a Fabry-Pérot (FP) polymer cavity has the following advantages: broadband frequency response, wide angular coverage and small footprint. Here, we present 3D PA mesoscope for mouse brain imaging using such an optical sensor. A heating laser was used to stabilize the sensor’s cavity length during the imaging process. To acquire data for a 3D angiogram of the mouse brain, the sensor was mounted on a translation stage and raster scanned. 3D images of the mouse brain vasculature were reconstructed which showed cerebrovascular structure up to a depth of 8 mm with high quality. Imaging segmentation and dual wavelength imaging were performed to demonstrate the potential of the system in preclinical brain research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Distribution of Skull Score and Skull Density Ratio in Tremor Patients for MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.612940</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.612940</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a minimum-invasive surgical approach to non-incisionally cause the thermos-coagulation inside the human brain. The skull score (SS) has already been approved as one of the most dominant factors related to a successful MRgFUS treatment. In this study, we first reveal the SS distribution of the tremor patients, and correlate the SS with the image feature from customized skull density ratio (cSDR). This correlation might give a direction to future clinical studies for improving the SS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two hundred and forty-six patients received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, and a bone-enhanced filter was applied and reconstructed to a high spatial resolution CT images. The SS of all patients would be estimated by the MRgFUS system after importing the reconstructed CT images into the MRgFUS system. The histogram and the cumulative distribution of the SS from all the patients were calculated to show the percentage of the patients whose SS lower than 0.3 and 0.4. The same CT images of all patients were utilized to calculated the cSDR by first segmented the trabecular bone and the cortical bone from the CT images and divided the average trabecular bone intensity (aTBI) by the average cortical bone intensity (aCBI). The Pearson’s correlations between the SS and the cSDR, aTBI, and the aCBI were calculated, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 19.19 and 50% of the patient who had the SS lower than the empirical threshold 0.3 and 0.4, respectively. The Pearson’s correlation between the SS and the cSDR, aCBI, and the aTBI were R = 0.8145, 0.5723, and 0.8842.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Half of the patients were eligible for the MRgFUS thalamotomy based on the SS, and nearly 20% of patients were empirically difficult to achieve a therapeutic temperature during MRgFUS. The SS and our cSDR are highly correlated, and the SS had a higher correlation with aTBI than with aCBI. This is the first report to explicitly reveal the SS population and indicate a potential way to increase the chance to achieve a therapeutic temperature for those who originally have low SS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Probabilistic Atlas of the Pineal Gland in the Standard Space</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.554229</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.554229</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pineal gland (PG) is a structure located in the midline of the brain, and is considered as a main part of the epithalamus. There are numerous reports on the facilitatory role of this area for brain function; hormone secretion and its role in sleep cycle are the major reports. However, reports are rarely available on the direct role of this structure in brain cognition and in information processing. A suggestion for the limited number of such studies is the lack of a standard atlas for the PG; none of the available MRI templates and atlases has provided parcellations for this structure. In this study, we used the three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted MRI data of 152 healthy young volunteers, and provided a probabilistic map of the PG in the standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. The methods included collecting the data using a 64-channel head coil on a 3-Tesla Prisma MRI Scanner, manual delineation of the PG by two experts, and robust template and atlas construction algorithms. This atlas is freely accessible, and we hope importing this atlas in the well-known neuroimaging software packages would help to identify other probable roles of the PG in brain function. It could also be used to study pineal cysts, for volumetric analyses, and to test any associations between the cognitive abilities of the human and the structure of the PG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Idiosyncratic Characteristics of Postural Sway in Normal and Perturbed Standing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660470</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660470</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Are people with a characteristically large physiological sway rendered particularly unstable when standing on a moving surface? Is postural sway in standing individuals idiosyncratic? In this study, we examine postural sway in individuals standing normally, and when subtle continuous sinusoidal disturbances are applied to their support platform. We calculate consistency between conditions to verify if sway can be considered characteristic of each individual. We also correlate two different aspects of participants’ responses to disturbance; their sway velocity and their regulation of body orientation.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Nineteen healthy adults (age 29.2 ± 3.2 years) stood freely on footplates coaxially aligned with their ankles and attached to a motorized platform. They had their eyes closed, and hips and knees locked with a light wooden board attached to their body. Participants either stood quietly on a fixed platform or on a slowly tilting platform (0.1 Hz sinusoid; 0.2 and 0.4 deg). Postural sway size was separated into two entities: (1) the spontaneous sway velocity component (natural random relatively rapid postural adjustments, RMS body angular velocity) and (2) the evoked tilt gain component (much slower 0.1 Hz synchronous tilt induced by the movement of the platform, measured as peak-to-peak (p-p) gain, ratio of body angle to applied footplate rotation).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was no correlation between the velocity of an individual’s sway and their evoked tilt gain (r = 0.34, p = 0.15 and r = 0.30, p = 0.22). However, when considered separately, each of the two measurements showed fair to good absolute agreement within conditions. Spontaneous sway velocity consistently increased as participants were subjected to increasing disturbance. Participants who swayed more (or less) did so across all conditions [ICC&lt;sub&gt;(3,k)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.95]. Evoked tilt gain also showed consistency between conditions [ICC&lt;sub&gt;(3,k)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.79], but decreased from least to most disturbed conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The two measurements remain consistent between conditions. Consistency between conditions of two very distinct unrelated measurements reflects the idiosyncratic nature of postural sway. However, sway velocity and tilt gain are not related, which supports the idea that the short-term regulation of stability and the longer-term regulation of orientation are controlled by different processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex for Speech and Language Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.645209</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.645209</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review article summarizes various functions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that are related to language processing. To this end, its connectivity with the left-dominant perisylvian language network was considered, as well as its interaction with other functional networks that, directly or indirectly, contribute to language processing. Language-related functions of the DLPFC comprise various aspects of pragmatic processing such as discourse management, integration of prosody, interpretation of nonliteral meanings, inference making, ambiguity resolution, and error repair. Neurophysiologically, the DLPFC seems to be a key region for implementing functional connectivity between the language network and other functional networks, including cortico-cortical as well as subcortical circuits. Considering clinical aspects, damage to the DLPFC causes psychiatric communication deficits rather than typical aphasic language syndromes. Although the number of well-controlled studies on DLPFC language functions is still limited, the DLPFC might be an important target region for the treatment of pragmatic language disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Indirect Vibration of the Upper Limbs Alters Transmission Along Spinal but Not Corticospinal Pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617669</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617669</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The use of upper limb vibration (ULV) during exercise and rehabilitation continues to gain popularity as a modality to improve function and performance. Currently, a lack of knowledge of the pathways being altered during ULV limits its effective implementation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether indirect ULV modulates transmission along spinal and corticospinal pathways that control the human forearm. All measures were assessed under CONTROL (no vibration) and ULV (30 Hz; 0.4 mm displacement) conditions while participants maintained a small contraction of the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. To assess spinal pathways, Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) elicited by stimulation of the median nerve were recorded from FCR with motor response (M-wave) amplitudes matched between conditions. An H-reflex conditioning paradigm was also used to assess changes in presynaptic inhibition by stimulating the superficial radial (SR) nerve (5 pulses at 300Hz) 37 ms prior to median nerve stimulation. Cutaneous reflexes in FCR elicited by stimulation of the SR nerve at the wrist were also recorded. To assess corticospinal pathways, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex were recorded from the right FCR and biceps brachii (BB). ULV significantly reduced H-reflex amplitude by 15.7% for both conditioned and unconditioned reflexes (24.0 ± 15.7 vs. 18.4 ± 11.2% M&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Middle latency cutaneous reflexes were also significantly reduced by 20.0% from CONTROL (−1.50 ± 2.1% Mmax) to ULV (−1.73 ± 2.2% Mmax; p &amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant effect of ULV on MEP amplitude (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Therefore, ULV inhibits cutaneous and H-reflex transmission without influencing corticospinal excitability of the forearm flexors suggesting increased presynaptic inhibition of afferent transmission as a likely mechanism. A general increase in inhibition of spinal pathways with ULV may have important implications for improving rehabilitation for individuals with spasticity (SCI, stroke, MS, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Equilibrium propagation is a learning framework that marks a step forward in the search for a biologically-plausible implementation of deep learning, and could be implemented efficiently in neuromorphic hardware. Previous applications of this framework to layered networks encountered a vanishing gradient problem that has not yet been solved in a simple, biologically-plausible way. In this paper, we demonstrate that the vanishing gradient problem can be mitigated by replacing some of a layered network's connections with random layer-skipping connections in a manner inspired by small-world networks. This approach would be convenient to implement in neuromorphic hardware, and is biologically-plausible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Function and Regulation of ALDH1A1-Positive Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic Neurons in Motor Control and Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is an important chemical messenger in the brain, which modulates movement, reward, motivation, and memory. Different populations of neurons can produce and release dopamine in the brain and regulate different behaviors. Here we focus our discussion on a small but distinct group of dopamine-producing neurons, which display the most profound loss in the ventral substantia nigra pas compacta of patients with Parkinson’s disease. This group of dopaminergic neurons can be readily identified by a selective expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and accounts for 70% of total nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both human and mouse brains. Recently, we presented the first whole-brain circuit map of these ALDH1A1-positive dopaminergic neurons and reveal an essential physiological function of these neurons in regulating the vigor of movement during the acquisition of motor skills. In this review, we first summarize previous findings of ALDH1A1-positive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and their connectivity and functionality, and then provide perspectives on how the activity of ALDH1A1-positive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is regulated through integrating diverse presynaptic inputs and its implications for potential Parkinson’s disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Circulating Neurofilament Light Predicts Cognitive Decline in Patients With Post-stroke Subjective Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is common after acute ischemic stroke and adversely affects the quality of life. SCI is associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Identifying biomarkers which could predict long-term cognitive outcomes of post-stroke SCI is of importance for early intervention. This study aims to investigate the association between circulating neurofilament light (NfL) and long-term cognitive function in patients with post-stroke SCI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal study recruited 304 patients with post-stroke SCI, and serum NfL levels were determined at baseline. These patients were followed up for 12 months for the observation of cognitive change. Cognitive performances were assessed by a Chinese version of the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40) scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The patients were divided into a progression group (as determined by decreased TICS-40 scores) and a stable group (as determined by increased or unchanged TICS-40 scores). The progression group had significantly higher serum NfL levels than the stable group at baseline. Serum NfL levels were predictive for longitudinal cognitive decline during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings imply that circulating NfL could predict the long-term cognitive change of patients with post-stroke SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Molecular Pathobiology of the Cerebrovasculature in Aging and in Alzheimers Disease Cases With Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular dysfunction and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular damage to cerebrovessels in AD may result in alterations in vascular clearance mechanisms leading to amyloid deposition around blood vessels and diminished neurovascular-coupling. The sequelae of molecular events leading to these early pathogenic changes remains elusive. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive in-depth molecular characterization of the proteomic changes in enriched cerebrovessel fractions isolated from the inferior frontal gyrus of autopsy AD cases with low (85.5 ± 2.9 yrs) vs. high (81 ± 4.4 yrs) CAA score, aged-matched control (87.4 ± 1.5 yrs) and young healthy control (47 ± 3.3 yrs) cases. We employed a 10-plex tandem isobaric mass tag approach in combination with our ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography MS/MS (Q-Exactive) method. Enriched cerebrovascular fractions showed very high expression levels of proteins specific to endothelial cells, mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells), and astrocytes. We observed 150 significantly regulated proteins in young vs. aged control cerebrovessels. The top pathways significantly modulated with aging included chemokine, reelin, HIF1α and synaptogenesis signaling pathways. There were 213 proteins significantly regulated in aged-matched control vs. high CAA cerebrovessels. The top three pathways significantly altered from this comparison were oxidative phosphorylation, Sirtuin signaling pathway and TCA cycle II. Comparison between low vs. high CAA cerebrovessels identified 84 significantly regulated proteins. Top three pathways significantly altered between low vs. high CAA cerebrovessels included TCA Cycle II, Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, high CAA cases included more advanced AD pathology thus cerebrovascular effects may be driven by the severity of amyloid and Tangle pathology. These descriptive proteomic changes provide novel insights to explain the age-related and AD-related cerebrovascular changes contributing to AD pathogenesis. Particularly, disturbances in energy bioenergetics and mitochondrial biology rank among the top AD pathways altered in cerebrovessels. Targeting these failed mechanisms in endothelia and mural cells may provide novel disease modifying targets for developing therapeutic strategies against cerebrovascular deterioration and promoting cerebral perfusion in AD. Our future work will focus on interrogating and validating these novel targets and pathways and their functional significance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement and its rapidly progressive subtype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26101</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26101?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study we included 31 patients with systemic GCA with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 (69.2%) patients with and in 16 (100%) without intracranial involvement (P = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 (50.0%) patients with and 13 (76.5%) patients without intracranial involvement (P = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 (54.8%) and both territories in 12 (38.7%) patients. Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 (37.9%) patients had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median mRS at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (IQR 2.0–6.0) and 4 (36.4%) patients died. Vessel wall expression of IL6 and IL17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL17 and IL6 may represent potential future treatment targets.

	<title>Hippocampus: Locomotor action sequences impact the scale of representation in hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23339</guid>

	<description>Abstract
The hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex are implicated in both episodic memory and encoding of position in an environment. In the present study, we examine the impact of locomotor behaviors associated with movement in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions on population activity patterns in these two brain structures. We utilized a five‐looped, squared spiral track containing stair segments, ramp segments, and flat segments. In addition to encoding locations along the full route, posterior parietal cortex population activity demonstrates strong pattern recurrence for similar action types at different locations in the environment. Additionally, posterior parietal and hippocampal neurons exhibit parallel modulation in the scale of representation that follows behavioral dynamics required for track traversal. These findings build on prior work examining spatial mapping in the vertical dimension and provide a better understanding of how a series of actions and visited locations can be coordinated in the generation of episodic memory.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effects of subclinical depression on prefrontal–striatal model-based and model-free learning</title>

Depression is characterized by deficits in the reinforcement learning (RL) process. Although many computational and neural studies have extended our knowledge of the impact of depression on RL, most focus on habitual control (model-free RL), yielding a relatively poor understanding of goal-directed control (model-based RL) and arbitration control to find a balance between the two. We investigated the effects of subclinical depression on model-based and model-free learning in the prefrontal–striatal circuitry. First, we found that subclinical depression is associated with the attenuated state and reward prediction error representation in the insula and caudate. Critically, we found that it accompanies the disrupted arbitration control between model-based and model-free learning in the predominantly inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex. We also found that depression undermines the ability to exploit viable options, called exploitation sensitivity. These findings characterize how subclinical depression influences different levels of the decision-making hierarchy, advancing previous conflicting views that depression simply influences either habitual or goal-directed control. Our study creates possibilities for various clinical applications, such as early diagnosis and behavioral therapy design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9aeQWxZ7b3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Extracellular recording is an accessible technique used in animals and humans to study the brain physiology and pathology. As the number of recording channels and their density grows it is natural to ask how much improvement the additional channels bring in and how we can optimally use the new capabilities for monitoring the brain. Here we show that for any given distribution of electrodes we can establish exactly what information about current sources in the brain can be recovered and what information is strictly unobservable. We demonstrate this in the general setting of previously proposed kernel Current Source Density method and illustrate it with simplified examples as well as using evoked potentials from the barrel cortex obtained with a Neuropixels probe and with compatible model data. We show that with conceptual separation of the estimation space from experimental setup one can recover sources not accessible to standard methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wu2qYM5r6Go&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Specific neuronal subpopulations in the rat basolateral amygdala express high levels of nonphosphorylated neurofilaments</title>

	<description>Dual‐labeling immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing were used to characterize neurons in the basolateral amygdala that express SMI‐32+ nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs). Most of the neurons with strong somatic and dendritic expression of NNFs were parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, as well as nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs) that project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The graphical abstract shows six SMI‐32+ neurons (diffuse brown staining); five are also stained for PV (blue particulate staining) and one is PV‐negative (arrow). Studies in the cortex suggest that the SMI‐32+ neurons identified in this study may be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) containing nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs) localized with the SMI‐32 monoclonal antibody have been shown to be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present investigation is the first to study the expression of SMI‐32+ NNFs in neurons of the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BNC), which contains cortex‐like PNs and nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs). We observed that PNs in the rat basolateral nucleus (BL), but not in the lateral (LAT) or basomedial (BM) nuclei, have significant levels of SMI‐32‐ir in their somata with antibody diluents that did not contain Triton X‐100, but staining in these cells was greatly attenuated when the antibody diluent contained 0.3% Triton. Using Triton‐containing diluents, we found that all SMI‐32+ neurons in all three of the BNC nuclei were NPNs. Using a dual‐labeling immunoperoxidase technique, we demonstrated that most of these SMI‐32+ NPNs were parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) or somatostatin‐positive NPNs but not vasoactive intestinal peptide‐positive or neuropeptide Y‐positive NPNs. Using a technique that combines retrograde tracing with SMI‐32 immunohistochemistry using intermediate levels of Triton in the diluent, we found that all BNC neurons projecting to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were large NPNs, and most were SMI‐32+. In contrast, BNC neurons projecting to the ventral striatum or cerebral cortex were PNs that expressed low levels of SMI‐32 immunoreactivity (SMI‐32‐ir) in the BL, and no SMI‐32‐ir in the LAT or BM. These data suggest that the main neuronal subpopulations in the BNC that degenerate in AD may be PV+ and MD‐projecting NPNs.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Translational Block in Stroke: A Constructive and “Out-of-the-Box” Reappraisal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652403</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Why can we still not translate preclinical research to clinical treatments for acute strokes? Despite &amp;gt; 1000 successful preclinical studies, drugs, and concepts for acute stroke, only two have reached clinical translation. This is the translational block. Yet, we continue to routinely model strokes using almost the same concepts we have used for over 30 years. Methodological improvements and criteria from the last decade have shed some light but have not solved the problem. In this conceptual analysis, we review the current status and reappraise it by thinking “out-of-the-box” and over the edges. As such, we query why other scientific fields have also faced the same translational failures, to find common denominators. In parallel, we query how migraine, multiple sclerosis, and hypothermia in hypoxic encephalopathy have achieved significant translation successes. Should we view ischemic stroke as a “chronic, relapsing, vascular” disease, then secondary prevention strategies are also a successful translation. Finally, based on the lessons learned, we propose how stroke should be modeled, and how preclinical and clinical scientists, editors, grant reviewers, and industry should reconsider their routine way of conducting research. Translational success for stroke treatments may eventually require a bold change with solutions that are outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Detection and Grading of Gliomas Using a Novel Two-Phase Machine Learning Method Based on MRI Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.650629</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The early detection and grading of gliomas is important for treatment decision and assessment of prognosis. Over the last decade numerous automated computer analysis tools have been proposed, which can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. In this paper, we used the gradient-based features extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images to depict the subtle changes within brains of patients with gliomas. Based on the gradient features, we proposed a novel two-phase classification framework for detection and grading of gliomas. In the first phase, the probability of each local feature being related to different types (e.g., diseased or healthy for detection, benign or malignant for grading) was calculated. Then the high-level feature representing the whole MRI image was generated by concatenating the membership probability of each local feature. In the second phase, the supervised classification algorithm was used to train a classifier based on the high-level features and patient labels of the training subjects. We applied this framework on the brain imaging data collected from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for glioma detection, and the public TCIA datasets including glioblastomas (WHO IV) and low-grade gliomas (WHO II and III) data for glioma grading. The experimental results showed that the gradient-based classification framework could be a promising tool for automatic diagnosis of brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurological injuries such as strokes can lead to important loss in motor function. Thanks to neuronal plasticity, some of the lost functionality may be recovered over time. However, the recovery process is often slow and incomplete, despite the most effective conventional rehabilitation therapies. As we improve our understanding of the rules governing activity-dependent plasticity, neuromodulation interventions are being developed to harness neural plasticity to achieve faster and more complete recovery. Here, we review the principles underlying stimulation-driven plasticity as well as the most commonly used stimulation techniques and approaches. We argue that increased spatiotemporal precision is an important factor to improve the efficacy of neurostimulation and drive a more useful neuronal reorganization. Consequently, closed-loop systems and optogenetic stimulation hold theoretical promise as interventions to promote brain repair after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Motor Sequence Learning Under Interleaved and Repetitive Practice: A Two-Channel Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644968</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Training under high interference conditions through interleaved practice (IP) results in performance suppression during training but enhances long-term performance relative to repetitive practice (RP) involving low interference. Previous neuroimaging work addressing this contextual interference effect of motor learning has relied heavily on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology resulting in mixed reports of prefrontal cortex (PFC) recruitment under IP and RP conditions. We sought to clarify these equivocal findings by imaging bilateral PFC recruitment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while discrete key pressing sequences were trained under IP and RP schedules and subsequently tested following a 24-h delay. An advantage of fNIRS over the fMRI BOLD response is that the former measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes independently allowing for assessment of cortical hemodynamics even when there is neurovascular decoupling. Despite slower sequence performance durations under IP, bilateral PFC oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin values did not differ between practice conditions. During test, however, slower performance from those previously trained under RP coincided with hemispheric asymmetry in PFC recruitment. Specifically, following RP, test deoxygenated hemoglobin values were significantly lower in the right PFC. The present findings contrast with previous behavioral demonstrations of increased cognitive demand under IP to illustrate a more complex involvement of the PFC in the contextual interference effect. IP and RP incur similar levels of bilateral PFC recruitment, but the processes underlying the recruitment are dissimilar. PFC recruitment during IP supports action reconstruction and memory elaboration while RP relies on PFC recruitment to maintain task variation information in working memory from trial to trial. While PFC recruitment under RP serves to enhance immediate performance, it does not support long-term performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Elevated Inter-Brain Coherence Between Subjects With Concordant Stances During Discussion of Social Issues</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms offer convenient, instantaneous social sharing on a mass scale with tremendous impact on public perceptions, opinions, and behavior. There is a need to understand why information spreads including the human motivations, cognitive processes, and neural dynamics of large-scale sharing. This study introduces a novel approach for investigating the effect social media messaging and in-person discussion has on the inter-brain dynamics within small groups of participants. The psychophysiological impact of information campaigns and narrative messaging within a closed social media environment was assessed using 24-channel wireless EEG. Data were acquired from three- or four-person groups while subjects debated contemporary social issues framed by four scenarios of varying controversy: (a) investing in ethical vs. unethical corporations, (b) selecting travel destination based on social awareness, (c) determining verdict in a murder trial and the punishment of life in prison or death penalty, and (d) decision to vaccinate. Pre-/post-scenario questionnaires assess the effects of the social media information. Inter-brain coherence between subject pairs on each social issue discussed by subjects was analyzed by concordance, agreement vs. disagreement, and by group unanimity, unanimous vs. not unanimous. Subject pairs that agreed on the social issues raised in the scenarios had significantly greater inter-brain coherence in gamma frequency range than disagreeing pairs over cortical regions known to be involved in social interactions. These effects were magnified when comparing groups where subject pairs were unanimous in their stance on the social issues for some but not all scenarios. While there was considerable overlap between scenarios in what EEG channels were significant, there was enough variability to indicate the possibility of scenario-specific effects on inter-brain coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Reversible Changes in BDNF Expression in MK-801-Induced Hippocampal Astrocytes Through NMDAR/PI3K/ERK Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.672136</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dizocilpine (MK-801), a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, can induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy individuals, implicating NMDA-R hypofunction in disease pathogenesis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also implicated in schizophrenia, and expression is regulated by NMDA-R activity, suggesting a functional link. We previously found that BDNF signaling was upregulated by MK-801 in cultured hippocampal astrocytes, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. To address this issue, the levels of BDNF expression and secretion were evaluated in hippocampal astrocytes incubated with MK-801 by ELISA and qPCR, with and without NMDA co-incubation or pretreatment of either the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 or the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The apoptosis, viability, and proliferation of the astrocytes were also examined. In the current study, we demonstrate that MK-801 treatment (20 μM for 5 days) enhances the proliferation of rat cultured hippocampal astrocytes. Expression of BDNF mRNA was enhanced after 24 h in MK-801, but returned to near baseline over the next 24 h in the continued presence of MK-801. However, two successive 24-h treatments enhanced BDNF expression. These application regimens had no effect on apoptosis or proliferation rate. Co-addition of NMDA significantly inhibited MK-801-induced upregulation of BDNF. Similarly, MK-801-induced BDNF upregulation was blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of PI3K and ERK1/2, but not by inhibitors of p38 and JNK. These findings suggested that astrocytes may contribute to the acute neurological and behavioral response to MK-801 treatment via a transient increase in BDNF expression involving NMDA-R–PI3K–ERK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Silencing of Long Noncoding RNA Growth Arrest–Specific 5 Alleviates Neuronal Cell Apoptosis and Inflammatory Responses Through Sponging microRNA-93 to Repress PTEN Expression in Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.646788</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A secondary injury induced by a spinal cord injury (SCI) remains the main cause of devastating neural dysfunction; therefore, it has been the subject of focused research for many years. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been found to participate in the SCI process, and this finding presents a high potential for diagnosis and treatment; however, the role of lncRNA in a secondary injury induced by SCI remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of lncRNA growth arrest–specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in secondary injury during SCI. The SCI mice model and hypoxic cellular model were established to research the roles of lncRNA GAS5 during SCI. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to determine the expression levels of microR-93 (miR-93) and lncRNA GAS5. Western blot analysis of the apoptosis regulator protein and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was conducted to evaluate neuron cell apoptosis. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were calculated to assess neurological function. Flow cytometry was used to determine neuron cell apoptosis. The associations among GAS5, miR-93, and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were disclosed using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, RNA pulldown assay, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. QRT-PCR demonstrated that GAS5 was significantly upregulated in both the SCI mice and hypoxic cellular models. GAS5 knockdown suppressed neuron cell apoptosis and inflammatory response in the SCI mice model. Further studies have indicated that GAS5 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-93 in neuronal cells. In addition, PTEN was a target of miR-93, and GAS5 knockdown exhibited its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects through the miR-93/PTEN axis. These findings suggest that the GAS5/miR-93/PTEN axis may be a promising therapeutic target for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Acupuncture for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia: An Overview of Systematic Reviews</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.647629</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.647629</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Dementia is a gradual decline in cognitive ability and is becoming more common in our elderly population. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as a slight clinical deterioration of memory capacity, below the level of normal aging, but does not constitute a clinical diagnosis of dementia. To date, no interventions have been proven to cure MCI and dementia fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: To evaluate the potential effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and evaluate the methodological quality of systematic reviews (SRs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted a literature search for SRs with meta-analyses in seven Chinese and international databases through October 1, 2020. The basic characteristics of the included SRs/meta-analyses and the basic information of the original included randomized controlled trials were extracted by three reviewers independently. A meta-analysis of the original randomized controlled trials from the included SRs/meta-analyses was performed using Stata 12.0 software. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 was used to assess the methodological quality of the included SRs/meta-analyses, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to rate the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 35 SRs/meta-analyses were included, and the majority showed that acupuncture was more effective than western medicine or conventional therapy for MCI and dementia [odds ratio =1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 1.56]. There was a statistically significant difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination score (weighted mean difference = 1.23; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.68; p &amp;lt; 0.00001), and there was no significant improvement in the activities of daily living score (weighted mean difference = 1.58; 95% CI: −0.02, 3.18; p = 0.053). The assessment results of Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 showed that the methodological quality of most included SRs/meta-analyses was critically low; the lowest scores were items 2, 7, and 10. For Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, of the 73 outcomes, 50 (68.5%) outcomes were low or very low quality, and 23 (31.5%) outcomes were moderate quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Acupuncture can be considered as an alternative for the treatment of MCI and dementia when western medicine or other therapies are contraindicated. More high-quality evidence is needed to determine further the effectiveness of acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Endothelial Dysfunction and Impaired Neurovascular Coupling Responses Precede Cognitive Impairment in a Mouse Model of Geriatric Sepsis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.644733</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, the incidence of which is significantly increased in elderly patients. One of the long-lasting effects of sepsis is cognitive impairment defined as a new deficit or exacerbation of preexisting deficits in global cognition or executive function. Normal brain function is dependent on moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow to match the increased demands of active brain regions. This homeostatic mechanism, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC, also known as functional hyperemia), is critically dependent on the production of vasodilator NO by microvascular endothelial cells in response to mediators released from activated astrocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that sepsis in aging leads to impairment of NVC responses early after treatment and that this neurovascular dysfunction associates with impairments in cognitive performance and vascular endothelial dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we used a commonly studied bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, to induce sepsis in experimental animals (males, 24 months of age) and subjected experimental animals to a standard clinical protocol of 3 doses of ampicillin i.p. and 14 days of amoxicillin added to the drinking water. NVC responses, endothelial function and cognitive performance were measured in septic and age-matched control groups within 14 days after the final antibiotic treatment. Our data demonstrate that sepsis in aging significantly impairs NVC responses measured in somatosensory cortex during whisker stimulation, significantly impairs endothelial function in isolated and pressure cannulated aorta rings in response to acetylcholine stimulation. No significant impairment of cognitive function in post-sepsis aged animals has been observed when measured using the PhenoTyper homecage based system. Our findings suggest that sepsis-associated endothelial dysfunction and impairment of NVC responses may contribute to long-term cognitive deficits in older sepsis survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With electronic (e)-liquids containing cannabis components easily available, many anecdotal examples of cannabis vaping using electronic cigarette devices have been reported. For electronic cigarette cannabis vaping, there are potential risks of secondary indoor air pollution from vapers. However, quantitative and accurate prediction of the inhalation and dermal exposure of a passive smoker in the same room is difficult to achieve due to the ethical constraints on subject experiments. The numerical method, i.e., &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; method, is a powerful tool to complement these experiments with real humans. In this study, we adopted a computer-simulated person that has been validated from multiple perspectives for prediction accuracy. We then conducted an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; study to elucidate secondary indoor air pollution and passive smoking associated with cannabis vaping using an electronic cigarette device in an indoor environment. The aerosols exhaled by a cannabis vaper were confirmed to be a secondary emission source in an indoor environment; non-smokers were exposed to these aerosols via respiratory and dermal pathways. Tetrahydrocannabinol was used as a model chemical compound for the exposure study. Its uptake by the non-smoker through inhalation and dermal exposure under a worst-case scenario was estimated to be 5.9% and 2.6% of the exhaled quantity from an e-cigarette cannabis user, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P_GHhmu4SWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The determination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures at atomic resolution has improved understanding of cellular signaling and will accelerate the development of new drug candidates. However, experimental structures still remain unavailable for a majority of the GPCR family. GPCR structures and their interactions with ligands can also be modelled computationally, but such predictions have limited accuracy. In this work, we explored if molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could be used to refine the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; models of receptor-ligand complexes that were submitted to a community-wide assessment of GPCR structure prediction (GPCR Dock). Two simulation protocols were used to refine 30 models of the D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R) in complex with an antagonist. Close to 60 μs of simulation time was generated and the resulting MD refined models were compared to a D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structure. In the MD simulations, the transmembrane helix region of the models generally drifted further away from the crystal structure conformation. However, MD refinement was able to improve the accuracy of the ligand binding mode and the second extracellular loop region. The best refinement protocol improved agreement with the experimentally observed ligand binding mode for a majority of the models. Receptor structures with improved virtual screening performance, which was assessed by molecular docking of ligands and decoys, could also be identified among the MD refined models. Application of weak restraints to the transmembrane helixes in the MD simulations further improved predictions of the ligand binding mode and second extracellular loop. These results provide guidelines for application of MD refinement in prediction of GPCR-ligand complexes and directions for further method development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/30b3CvNBcXE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The investigation of cell shapes mostly relies on the manual classification of 2D images, causing a subjective and time consuming evaluation based on a portion of the cell surface. We present a dual-stage neural network architecture for analyzing fine shape details from confocal microscopy recordings in 3D. The system, tested on red blood cells, uses training data from both healthy donors and patients with a congenital blood disease, namely hereditary spherocytosis. Characteristic shape features are revealed from the spherical harmonics spectrum of each cell and are automatically processed to create a reproducible and unbiased shape recognition and classification. The results show the relation between the particular genetic mutation causing the disease and the shape profile. With the obtained 3D phenotypes, we suggest our method for diagnostics and theragnostics of blood diseases. Besides the application employed in this study, our algorithms can be easily adapted for the 3D shape phenotyping of other cell types and extend their use to other applications, such as industrial automated 3D quality control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ScLdcLYEclY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deep neural networks have demonstrated improved performance at predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins compared to previous methods that rely on &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers and position weight matrices. To gain insights into why a DNN makes a given prediction, model interpretability methods, such as attribution methods, can be employed to identify motif-like representations along a given sequence. Because explanations are given on an individual sequence basis and can vary substantially across sequences, deducing generalizable trends across the dataset and quantifying their effect size remains a challenge. Here we introduce global importance analysis (GIA), a model interpretability method that quantifies the population-level effect size that putative patterns have on model predictions. GIA provides an avenue to quantitatively test hypotheses of putative patterns and their interactions with other patterns, as well as map out specific functions the network has learned. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of GIA on the computational task of predicting RNA-protein interactions from sequence. We first introduce a convolutional network, we call ResidualBind, and benchmark its performance against previous methods on RNAcompete data. Using GIA, we then demonstrate that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that considers the number of motifs, their spacing, and sequence context, such as RNA secondary structure and GC-bias.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NZtyHrKkm00&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species is controlled by ATPase inhibitory factor 1 and regulates cognition</title>

The mitochondrial ATP synthase emerges as key hub of cellular functions controlling the production of ATP, cellular signaling, and fate. It is regulated by the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), which is highly abundant in neurons. Herein, we ablated or overexpressed IF1 in mouse neurons to show that IF1 dose defines the fraction of active/inactive enzyme in vivo, thereby controlling mitochondrial function and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses indicate that IF1 dose regulates mitochondrial metabolism, synaptic function, and cognition. Ablation of IF1 impairs memory, whereas synaptic transmission and learning are enhanced by IF1 overexpression. Mechanistically, quenching the IF1-mediated increase in mtROS production in mice overexpressing IF1 reduces the increased synaptic transmission and obliterates the learning advantage afforded by the higher IF1 content. Overall, IF1 plays a key role in neuronal function by regulating the fraction of ATP synthase responsible for mitohormetic mtROS signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/q6ZupBs9I6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Cryptic surface-associated multicellularity emerges through cell adhesion and its regulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001250</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/VtERbAWvuPU/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jordi van Gestel, Andreas Wagner&lt;/p&gt;

The repeated evolution of multicellularity leads to a wide diversity of organisms, many of which are sessile, including land plants, many fungi, and colonial animals. Sessile organisms adhere to a surface for most of their lives, where they grow and compete for space. Despite the prevalence of surface-associated multicellularity, little is known about its evolutionary origin. Here, we introduce a novel theoretical approach, based on spatial lineage tracking of cells, to study this origin. We show that multicellularity can rapidly evolve from 2 widespread cellular properties: cell adhesion and the regulatory control of adhesion. By evolving adhesion, cells attach to a surface, where they spontaneously give rise to primitive cell collectives that differ in size, life span, and mode of propagation. Selection in favor of large collectives increases the fraction of adhesive cells until a surface becomes fully occupied. Through kin recognition, collectives then evolve a central-peripheral polarity in cell adhesion that supports a division of labor between cells and profoundly impacts growth. Despite this spatial organization, nascent collectives remain cryptic, lack well-defined boundaries, and would require experimental lineage tracking technologies for their identification. Our results suggest that cryptic multicellularity could readily evolve and originate well before multicellular individuals become morphologically evident.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtERbAWvuPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Parkin Levels Decrease in Fibroblasts With Progranulin (PGRN) Pathogenic Variants and in a Cellular Model of PGRN Deficiency</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. Genetic forms of FTLD and ALS are caused by pathogenic variants in various genes, such as PGRN (progranulin). To date, depletion of parkin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a key mitophagy regulator, has been reported in sporadic ALS patients and ALS mice models with TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this work, we show parkin downregulation also in fibroblasts derived from FTLD patients with four different PGRN pathogenic variants. We corroborate this finding in control fibroblasts upon PGRN silencing, demonstrating additionally the decrease of parkin downstream targets, mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). Importantly, we show that TDP-43 overexpression rescues PRKN levels upon transient PGRN silencing, but not in FTLD fibroblasts with PGRN pathogenic variants, despite upregulating PGRN levels in both cases. Further observation of PRKN downregulation upon TDP-43 silencing, suggests that TDP-43 loss-of-function contributes to PRKN decrease. Our results provide further evidence that parkin downregulation might be a common and systemic phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases with TDP- 43 loss-of-function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Factor Met Regulates the Organization of Inhibitory Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.659856</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.659856</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common hypothesis explains autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in neuronal network connectivity. Mutation of genes including Met and downstream signaling components, e.g., PTEN, Tsc2 and, Rheb are involved in the control of synapse formation and stabilization and were all considered as risk genes for ASD. While the impact of Met on glutamatergic synapses was widely appreciated, its contribution to the stability of inhibitory, GABAergic synapses is poorly understood. The stabilization of GABAergic synapses depends on clustering of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we show in vivo and in vitro that Met is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of GABAergic synapses via induction of gephyrin clustering. Likewise, we provide evidence for Met-dependent gephyrin clustering via activation of mTOR. Our results support the notion that deficient GABAergic signaling represents a pathomechanism for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are constituted of abnormally phosphorylated tau, is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The oligomeric aggregates of tau in AD brain (AD O-tau) are believed to trigger NFT spreading by seeding normal tau aggregation as toxic seeds, in a prion-like fashion. Here, we revealed the features of AD O-tau by Western blots using antibodies against various epitopes and determined the effect of dephosphorylation on the seeding activity of AD O-tau by capture and seeded aggregation assays. We found that N-terminal truncated and C-terminalhyperphosphorylated tau species were enriched in AD O-tau. Dephosphorylation of AD O-tau by alkaline phosphatasediminished its activity in capturing tau in vitro and ininducing insoluble aggregates in cultured cells. Our resultssuggested that dephosphorylation passivated the seeding activity ofAD O-tau. Inhibition of phosphorylation may be a potentstrategy to prevent the spreading of tau patho3logy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether combining multiple radiomics signatures derived from the subregions of glioblastoma (GBM) can improve survival prediction of patients with GBM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In total, 129 patients were included in this study and split into training (n = 99) and test (n = 30) cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from each tumor region then radiomics scores were obtained separately using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression. A clinical nomogram was also constructed using various clinical risk factors. Radiomics nomograms were constructed by combing a single radiomics signature from the whole tumor region with clinical risk factors or combining three radiomics signatures from three tumor subregions with clinical risk factors. The performance of these models was assessed by the discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness metrics, and was compared with that of the clinical nomogram.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Incorporating the three radiomics signatures, i.e., Radscores for ET, NET, and ED, into the radiomics-based nomogram improved the performance in estimating survival (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.717/0.655) compared with that of the clinical nomogram (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.633/0.560) and that of the radiomics nomogram based on single region radiomics signatures (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.656/0.535).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The multiregional radiomics nomogram exhibited a favorable survival stratification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multi-Source Co-adaptation for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition by Mining Correlation Information</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.677106</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.677106</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since each individual subject may present completely different encephalogram (EEG) patterns with respect to other subjects, existing subject-independent emotion classifiers trained on data sampled from cross-subjects or cross-dataset generally fail to achieve sound accuracy. In this scenario, the domain adaptation technique could be employed to address this problem, which has recently got extensive attention due to its effectiveness on cross-distribution learning. Focusing on cross-subject or cross-dataset automated emotion recognition with EEG features, we propose in this article a robust multi-source co-adaptation framework by mining diverse correlation information (MACI) among domains and features with l&lt;sub&gt;2,1&lt;/sub&gt;−norm as well as correlation metric regularization. Specifically, by minimizing the statistical and semantic distribution differences between source and target domains, multiple subject-invariant classifiers can be learned together in a joint framework, which can make MACI use relevant knowledge from multiple sources by exploiting the developed correlation metric function. Comprehensive experimental evidence on DEAP and SEED datasets verifies the better performance of MACI in EEG-based emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Machine Learning for Predicting Individual Severity of Blepharospasm Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.670475</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.670475</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) evidence suggests that white matter abnormalities evaluated by local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) or fractional anisotropy (FA) occur in patients with blepharospasm (BSP), both of which are significantly correlated with disease severity. However, whether the individual severity of BSP can be identified using these DTI metrics remains unknown. We aimed to investigate whether a combination of machine learning techniques and LDH or FA can accurately identify the individual severity of BSP. Forty-one patients with BSP were assessed using the Jankovic Rating Scale and DTI. The patients were assigned to non-functionally and functionally limited groups according to their Jankovic Rating Scale scores. A machine learning scheme consisting of beam search and support vector machines was designed to identify non-functionally versus functionally limited outcomes, with the input features being LDH or FA in 68 white matter regions. The proposed machine learning scheme with LDH or FA yielded an overall accuracy of 88.67 versus 85.19% in identifying non-functionally limited versus functionally limited outcomes. The scheme also identified a sensitivity of 91.40 versus 85.87% in correctly identifying functionally limited outcomes, a specificity of 83.33 versus 83.67% in accurately identifying non-functionally limited outcomes, and an area under the curve of 93.7 versus 91.3%. These findings suggest that a combination of LDH or FA measurements and a sophisticated machine learning scheme can accurately and reliably identify the individual disease severity in patients with BSP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Imaging Voltage in Complete Neuronal Networks Within Patterned Microislands Reveals Preferential Wiring of Excitatory Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643868</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643868</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage imaging with fluorescent dyes affords the opportunity to map neuronal activity in both time and space. One limitation to imaging is the inability to image complete neuronal networks: some fraction of cells remains outside of the observation window. Here, we combine voltage imaging, post hoc immunocytochemistry, and patterned microisland hippocampal culture to provide imaging of complete neuronal ensembles. The patterned microislands completely fill the field of view of our high-speed (500 Hz) camera, enabling reconstruction of the spiking patterns of every single neuron in the network. Cultures raised on microislands are similar to neurons grown on coverslips, with parallel developmental trajectories and composition of inhibitory and excitatory cell types (CA1, CA3, and dentate granule cells, or DGC). We calculate the likelihood that action potential firing in one neuron triggers action potential firing in a downstream neuron in a spontaneously active network to construct a functional connection map of these neuronal ensembles. Importantly, this functional map indicates preferential connectivity between DGC and CA3 neurons and between CA3 and CA1 neurons, mimicking the neuronal circuitry of the intact hippocampus. We envision that patterned microislands, in combination with voltage imaging and methods to classify cell types, will be a powerful method for exploring neuronal function in both healthy and disease states. Additionally, because the entire neuronal network is sampled simultaneously, this strategy has the power to go further, revealing all functional connections between all cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Optical Spike Detection and Connectivity Analysis With a Far-Red Voltage-Sensitive Fluorophore Reveals Changes to Network Connectivity in Development and Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643859</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643859</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to optically record dynamics of neuronal membrane potential promises to revolutionize our understanding of neurobiology. In this study, we show that the far-red voltage sensitive fluorophore, Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential-1, or BeRST 1, can be used to monitor neuronal membrane potential changes across dozens of neurons at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Notably, voltage imaging with BeRST 1 can be implemented with affordable, commercially available illumination sources, optics, and detectors. BeRST 1 is well-tolerated in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and provides exceptional optical recording fidelity, as judged by dual fluorescence imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology. We developed a semi-automated spike-picking program to reduce user bias when calling action potentials and used this in conjunction with BeRST 1 to develop an optical spike and connectivity analysis (OSCA) for high-throughput dissection of neuronal activity dynamics. The high temporal resolution of BeRST 1 enables dissection of firing rate changes in response to acute, pharmacological interventions with commonly used inhibitors like gabazine and picrotoxin. Over longer periods of time, BeRST 1 also tracks chronic perturbations to neurons exposed to amyloid beta 1–42 (Aβ &lt;sup&gt;1–42&lt;/sup&gt;), revealing modest changes to spiking frequency but profound changes to overall network connectivity. Finally, we use OSCA to track changes in neuronal connectivity during maturation in culture, providing a functional readout of network assembly. We envision that use of BeRST 1 and OSCA described here will be of use to the broad neuroscience community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: In-vitro Recordings of Neural Magnetic Activity From the Auditory Brainstem Using Color Centers in Diamond: A Simulation Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643614</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643614</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetometry based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is a novel technique capable of measuring magnetic fields with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. With the further advancements of these sensors, they may open up novel approaches for the 2D imaging of neural signals in vitro. In the present study, we investigate the feasibility of NV-based imaging by numerically simulating the magnetic signal from the auditory pathway of a rodent brainstem slice (ventral cochlear nucleus, VCN, to the medial trapezoid body, MNTB) as stimulated by both electric and optic stimulation. The resulting signal from these two stimulation methods are evaluated and compared. A realistic pathway model was created based on published data of the neural morphologies and channel dynamics of the globular bushy cells in the VCN and their axonal projections to the principal cells in the MNTB. The pathway dynamics in response to optic and electric stimulation and the emitted magnetic fields were estimated using the cable equation. For simulating the optic stimulation, the light distribution in brain tissue was numerically estimated and used to model the optogenetic neural excitation based on a four state channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) model. The corresponding heating was also estimated, using the bio-heat equation and was found to be low (&amp;lt;2°C) even at excessively strong optic signals. A peak magnetic field strength of ∼0.5 and ∼0.1 nT was calculated from the auditory brainstem pathway after electrical and optical stimulation, respectively. By increasing the stimulating light intensity four-fold (far exceeding commonly used intensities) the peak magnetic signal strength only increased to 0.2 nT. Thus, while optogenetic stimulation would be favorable to avoid artefacts in the recordings, electric stimulation achieves higher peak fields. The present simulation study predicts that high-resolution magnetic imaging of the action potentials traveling along the auditory brainstem pathway will only be possible for next generation NV sensors. However, the existing sensors already have sufficient sensitivity to support the magnetic sensing of cumulated neural signals sampled from larger parts of the pathway, which might be a promising intermediate step toward further maturing this novel technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Iterative Restoration of the Fringe Phase (REFRASE) for QSM</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.537666</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.537666</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), reconstructed results can be critically biased by misinterpreted or missing phase data near the edges of the brain support originating from the non-local relationship between field and susceptibility. These data either have to be excluded or corrected before further processing can take place. To address this, our iterative restoration of the fringe phase (REFRASE) approach simultaneously enhances the accuracy of multi-echo phase data QSM maps and the extent of the area available for evaluation. Data loss caused by strong local phase gradients near the surface of the brain support is recovered within the original phase data using harmonic and dipole-based fields extrapolated from a robust support region toward an extended brain mask. Over several iterations, phase data are rectified prior to the application of further QSM processing steps. The concept is successfully validated on numerical phantoms and brain scans from a cohort of volunteers. The increased extent of the mask and improved numerical stability within the segmented globus pallidus confirm the efficacy of the presented method in comparison to traditional evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Antiepileptic Efficacy and Network Connectivity Modulation of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation by Vertex Suppression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667619</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667619</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A core feature of drug-resistant epilepsy is hyperexcitability in the motor cortex, and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a suitable treatment for seizures. However, the antiepileptic effect causing network reorganization has rarely been studied. Here, we assessed the impact of rTMS on functional network connectivity (FNC) in resting functional networks (RSNs) and their relation to treatment response. Fourteen patients with medically intractable epilepsy received inhibitive rTMS with a figure-of-eight coil over the vertex for 10 days spread across two weeks. We designed a 6-week follow-up phase divided into four time points to investigate FNC and rTMS-induced timing-dependent plasticity, such as seizure frequency and abnormal interictal discharges on electroencephalography (EEG). For psychiatric comorbidities, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were applied to measure depression and anxiety before and after rTMS. FNC was also compared to that of a cohort of 17 healthy control subjects. The after-effects of rTMS included all subjects that achieved the significant decrease rate of more than 50% in interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure frequency, 12 (14) patients with the reduction rate above 50% compared to the baseline, as well as emotional improvements in depression and anxiety (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In the analysis of RSNs, we found a higher synchronization between the sensorimotor network (SMN) and posterior default-mode network (pDMN) in epileptic patients than in healthy controls. In contrast to pre-rTMS, the results demonstrated a weaker FNC between the anterior DMN (aDMN) and SMN after rTMS, while the FNC between the aDMN and dorsal attention network (DAN) was greater (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Importantly, the depressive score was anticorrelated with the FNC of the aDMN-SMN (r = −0.67, p = 0.0022), which was markedly different in the good and bad response groups treated with rTMS (p = 0.0115). Based on the vertex suppression by rTMS, it is possible to achieve temporary clinical efficacy by modulating network reorganization in the DMN and SMN for patients with refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Occupational Injuries and Use of Benzodiazepines: A Systematic Review and Metanalysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.629719</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.629719</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Benzodiazepines have been widely used in clinical practice for over four decades and continue to be one of the most consumed and highly prescribed class of drugs available in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The literature indicates that Benzodiazepine users at a significantly increased risk of Motor Vehicle accidents compared to non-users but the impact on injuries at workplace is not well-defined. We aimed to investigate whether use of benzodiazepine is associated with increased risk of occupational injuries (OI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) among case controls, cross-sectional studies, either questionnaire or laboratory exams based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria, involving 324,168 OI from seven different countries, with an estimated occurrence of benzodiazepine positivity of 2.71% (95% CI 1.45–4.98). A total of 14 estimates were retrieved. Of them, 10 were based on laboratory analyses, three on institutional databases, while one study was based on questionnaires. Regarding the occupational groups, three estimates focused on commercial drivers (0.73%, 95% CI 0.12–4.30), that exhibited a reduced risk ratio for benzodiazepine positivity compared to other occupational groups (RR 0.109, 95% CI 0.063–0.187). Eventually, no increased risk for benzodiazepine positivity was identified, either from case control studies (OR 1.520, 95% CI 0.801–2.885, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 76%), or cross sectional studies, when only laboratory based estimates were taken in account (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.253–1.377, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 63%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Even though benzodiazepines have the potential to increase injury rates among casual and chronic users, available evidence are insufficient to sustain this hypothesis, particularly when focusing on laboratory-based studies (i.e., studies the characterized the benzodiazepine immediately before the event).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Changing the Cortical Conductor’s Tempo: Neuromodulation of the Claustrum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The claustrum is a thin sheet of neurons that is densely connected to many cortical regions and has been implicated in numerous high-order brain functions. Such brain functions arise from brain states that are influenced by neuromodulatory pathways from the cholinergic basal forebrain, dopaminergic substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and serotonergic raphe. Recent revelations that the claustrum receives dense input from these structures have inspired investigation of state-dependent control of the claustrum. Here, we review neuromodulation in the claustrum—from anatomical connectivity to behavioral manipulations—to inform future analyses of claustral function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Optical Imaging-Based Guidance of Viral Microinjections and Insertion of a Laminar Electrophysiology Probe Into a Predetermined Barrel in Mouse Area S1BF</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.541676</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wide-field Optical Imaging of Intrinsic Signals (OI-IS; Grinvald et al., 1986) is a method for imaging functional brain hemodynamic responses, mainly used to image activity from the surface of the cerebral cortex. It localizes small functional modules – such as cortical columns – with great spatial resolution and spatial specificity relative to the site of increases in neuronal activity. OI-IS is capable of imaging responses either through an intact or thinned skull or following a craniotomy. Therefore, it is minimally invasive, which makes it ideal for survival experiments. Here we describe OI-IS-based methods for guiding microinjections of optogenetics viral vectors in proximity to small functional modules (S1 barrels) of the cerebral cortex and for guiding the insertion of electrodes for electrophysiological recording into such modules. We validate our proposed methods by tissue processing of the cerebral barrel field area, revealing the track of the electrode in a predetermined barrel. In addition, we demonstrate the use of optical imaging to visualize the spatial extent of the optogenetics photostimulation, making it possible to estimate one of the two variables that conjointly determine which region of the brain is stimulated. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of OI-IS at high-magnification for imaging the upper recording contacts of a laminar probe, making it possible to estimate the insertion depth of all contacts relative to the surface of the cortex. These methods support the precise positioning of microinjections and recording electrodes, thus overcoming the variability in the spatial position of fine-scale functional modules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Developmental Characterization of Schizophrenia-Associated Gene Zswim6 in Mouse Forebrain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.669631</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.669631</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a devastating neuropsychiatric disease with a globally 1% life-long prevalence. Clinical studies have linked Zswim6 mutations to developmental and neurological diseases, including schizophrenia. Zswim6’s function remains largely unknown. Given the involvement of Zswim6 in schizophrenia and schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disease, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Zswim6 in the developing brain. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Zswim6 in the mouse forebrain by in situ hybridization with radioactive and non-radioactive-labeled riboprobes. Zswim6 mRNA was detected as early as E11.5 in the ventral forebrain. At E11.5–E13.5, Zswim6 was highly expressed in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). The LGE consisted of two progenitor populations. Dlx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;;Er81&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in dorsal LGE comprised progenitors of olfactory bulb interneurons, whereas Dlx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;;Isl1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitors in ventral LGE gave rise to striatal projection neurons. Zswim6 was not colocalized with Er81 in the dorsal LGE. In the ventral LGE, Zswim6 was colocalized with striatal progenitor marker Nolz-1. Zswim6 was highly expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of LGE in which progenitors undergo the transition from proliferation to differentiation. Double labeling showed that Zswim6 was not colocalized with proliferation marker Ki67 but was colocalized with differentiation marker Tuj1 in the SVZ, suggesting Zswim6 expression in early differentiating neurons. Zswim6 was also expressed in the adjacent structures of medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE, CGE) that contained progenitors of cortical interneurons. At E15.5 and E17.5, Zswim6 was expressed in several key brain regions that were involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, including the striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and medial habenular nucleus. Zswim6 was persistently expressed in the postnatal brain. Cell type analysis indicated that Zswim6 mRNA was colocalized with D1R-expressing striatonigral and D2R-expressing striatopallidal neurons of the adult striatum with a higher colocalization in striatopallidal neurons. These findings are of particular interest as striatal dopamine D2 receptors are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In summary, the comprehensive analysis provides an anatomical framework for the study of Zswim6 function and Zswim6-associated neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Context: Cognitive impairments are common in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are heterogeneous in their presentation. The “dual syndrome hypothesis” suggests the existence of two distinct subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD: a frontostriatal subtype with predominant attentional and/or executive deficits and a posterior cortical subtype with predominant visuospatial, memory, and/or language deficits. The latter subtype has been associated with a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of this study was to identify structural modifications in cortical and subcortical regions associated with each PD-MCI subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and fourteen non-demented PD patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment as well as a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan. Patients were categorized as having no cognitive impairment (n = 41) or as having a frontostriatal (n = 16), posterior cortical (n = 25), or a mixed (n = 32) MCI subtype. Cortical regions were analyzed using a surface-based Cortical thickness (CTh) method. In addition, the volumes, shapes, and textures of the caudate nuclei, hippocampi, and thalami were studied. Tractometric analyses were performed on associative and commissural white matter (WM) tracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were no between-group differences in volumetric measurements and cortical thickness. Shape analyses revealed more abundant and more extensive deformations fields in the caudate nuclei, hippocampi, and thalami in patients with posterior cortical deficits compared to patients with no cognitive impairment. Decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) were also observed in the superior longitudinal fascicle, the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, the striato-parietal tract, and the anterior and posterior commissural tracts. Texture analyses showed a significant difference in the right hippocampus of patients with a mixed MCI subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: PD-MCI patients with posterior cortical deficits have more abundant and more extensive structural alterations independently of age, disease duration, and severity, which may explain why they have an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: In recent years several &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeled amyloid PET (Aβ-PET) tracers have been developed and have obtained clinical approval. There is evidence that Aβ-PET perfusion can provide surrogate information about neuronal injury in neurodegenerative diseases when compared to conventional blood flow and glucose metabolism assessment. However, this paradigm has not yet been tested in neurodegenerative disorders with cortical and subcortical affection. Therefore, we investigated the performance of early acquisition &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flutemetamol Aβ-PET in comparison to &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in corticobasal syndrome (CBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Subjects with clinically possible or probable CBS were recruited within the prospective Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (ActiGliA) observational study and all CBS cases with an available FDG-PET prior to Aβ-PET were selected. Aβ-PET was acquired 0–10 min p.i. (early-phase) and 90–110 min p.i. (late-phase) whereas FDG-PET was recorded statically from 30 to 50 min p.i. Semiquantitative regional values and asymmetry indices (AI) were compared between early-phase Aβ-PET and FDG-PET. Visual assessments of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism were compared between both methods. Late-phase Aβ-PET was evaluated visually for assessment of Aβ-positivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among 20 evaluated patients with CBS, 5 were Aβ-positive. Early-phase Aβ-PET and FDG-PET SUVr correlated highly in cortical (mean R = 0.86, range 0.77–0.92) and subcortical brain regions (mean R = 0.84, range 0.79–0.90). Strong asymmetry was observed in FDG-PET for the motor cortex (mean |AI| = 2.9%), the parietal cortex (mean |AI| = 2.9%), and the thalamus (mean |AI| = 5.5%), correlating well with AI of early-phase Aβ-PET (mean R = 0.87, range 0.62–0.98). Visual assessments of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism were highly congruent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Early-phase Aβ-PET facilitates assessment of neuronal injury in CBS for cortical and subcortical areas. Known asymmetries in CBS are captured by this method, enabling assessment of Aβ-status and neuronal injury with a single radiation exposure at a single visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of Aging on Levo-Dihydroxyphenylalanine- Induced Dyskinesia in a Rat Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650350</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear why patients with young-onset Parkinson’s disease more often develop levo-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa)-induced dyskinesia (LID) and have a more severe form than patients with old-onset Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies using animal models have failed to show young-onset Parkinson’s disease enhances LID.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the association of age at dopaminergic denervation (onset age) and initiation of L-dopa treatment (treatment age) with LID development in model rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We established rat models of young- and old-lesioned Parkinson’s disease (6-hydroxydopamine lesions at 10 and 88 weeks of age, respectively). Dopaminergic denervation was confirmed by the rotational behavior test using apomorphine. Rats in the young-lesioned group were allocated to either L-dopa treatment at a young or old age, or saline treatment. Rats in the old-lesioned group were allocated to either L-dopa treatment or saline group. We evaluated L-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements during the 14-day treatment period. We also examined preprodynorphin mRNA expression in the striatum (a neurochemical hallmark of LID) and the volume of the medial globus pallidus (a pathological hallmark of LID).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;LID-like behavior was enhanced in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats compared with L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. Preprodynorphin mRNA expression was higher in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats than in in L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. The volume of the medial globus pallidus was greater in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats than in L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. Treatment age did not affect LID-like behavior or the degree of medial globus pallidus hypertrophy in the young-lesioned model.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both dopaminergic denervation and L-dopa initiation at a young age contributed to the development of LID; however, the former may be a more important factor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Childhood Neighborhood Quality and the Risk of Cognitive Dysfunction in Chinese Middle-Aged and Elderly Population: The Moderation Effect of Body Mass Index</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645189</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645189</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Identification of early modifiable factors is crucial to delay or prevent the development of cognitive impairment and reduce the social and economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations of childhood neighborhood quality (CNQ) with the risk of later-life cognitive dysfunction and the role of body mass index (BMI) in this association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 8,289 community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly population from wave 2011, wave 2013, and wave 2015 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were included. Cognitive function and CNQ were measured by standardized questionnaires. Multilevel linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of CNQ and cognitive function. The interactions of BMI with CNQ in the progress of cognitive function were also estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The participants with higher CNQ had a significantly low risk of cognitive impairment than those with lower CNQ score (β = 0.067, 95% CI: 0.031, 0.103), and the results remained similar (β = 0.039, 95% CI: 0.004, 0.075) after controlling other confounding variables. Furthermore, there was an interaction between BMI with CNQ score (P &amp;lt; 0.001) for the risk of cognitive impairment. In BMI-stratified analysis, we found that the association of CNQ and cognitive function was not statistically significant in overweight or obese population (β = 0.019, 95% CI: −0.032, 0.070), but was statistically significant in people with lower BMI (β = 0.059, 95% CI: 0.010, 0.107).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Higher CNQ score is significantly associated with the lower risk of cognitive dysfunction in adulthood. BMI may moderate the associations of CNQ with the risk of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased Plasma Level of 24S-Hydroxycholesterol and Polymorphism of CYP46A1 SNP (rs754203) Are Associated With Mild Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.619916</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Abnormal cholesterol metabolism is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and causes dementia. Cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) and maintains cholesterol homeostasis in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the roles of 24-OHC and the CYP46A1 (rs754203) polymorphism in patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 193 Chinese patients with T2DM were recruited into two groups according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical data were collected, and neuropsychological tests were conducted. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seqnome method were used to detect the concentration of plasma 24-OHC and the CYP46A1 rs754203 genotype, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with 118 healthy cognition participants, patients with MCI (n = 75) displayed a higher plasma level of 24-OHC and total cholesterol concentration (all p = 0.031), while no correlation was found between them. In the overall diabetes population, the plasma level of 24-OHC was negatively correlated with MoCA (r = −0.150, p = 0.039), and it was further proved to be an independent risk factor of diabetic MCI (OR = 1.848, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients with MCI and the CC genotype of CYP46A1 rs754203 showed the highest plasma level of 24-OHC even though the difference was not statistically significant, and they obtained low scores in both the verbal fluency test and Stroop color and word test A (p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In patients with T2DM, high plasma level of 24-OHC and the CC genotype carrier of CYP46A1 rs754203 may portend a high risk of developing early cognitive impairment, including attention and executive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder have altered visual encoding capacity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001215</guid>

Perceptual anomalies in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been attributed to an imbalance in weighting incoming sensory evidence with prior knowledge when interpreting sensory information. Here, we show that sensory encoding and how it adapts to changing stimulus statistics during feedback also characteristically differs between neurotypical and ASD groups. In a visual orientation estimation task, we extracted the accuracy of sensory encoding from psychophysical data by using an information theoretic measure. Initially, sensory representations in both groups reflected the statistics of visual orientations in natural scenes, but encoding capacity was overall lower in the ASD group. Exposure to an artificial (i.e., uniform) distribution of visual orientations coupled with performance feedback altered the sensory representations of the neurotypical group toward the novel experimental statistics, while also increasing their total encoding capacity. In contrast, neither total encoding capacity nor its allocation significantly changed in the ASD group. Across both groups, the degree of adaptation was correlated with participants’ initial encoding capacity. These findings highlight substantial deficits in sensory encoding—independent from and potentially in addition to deficits in decoding—in individuals with ASD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ncwIQm29wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Glyphosate inhibits melanization and increases susceptibility to infection in insects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001182</guid>

Melanin, a black-brown pigment found throughout all kingdoms of life, has diverse biological functions including UV protection, thermoregulation, oxidant scavenging, arthropod immunity, and microbial virulence. Given melanin’s broad roles in the biosphere, particularly in insect immune defenses, it is important to understand how exposure to ubiquitous environmental contaminants affects melanization. Glyphosate—the most widely used herbicide globally—inhibits melanin production, which could have wide-ranging implications in the health of many organisms, including insects. Here, we demonstrate that glyphosate has deleterious effects on insect health in 2 evolutionary distant species, &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt; (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting a broad effect in insects. Glyphosate reduced survival of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mellonella&lt;/i&gt; caterpillars following infection with the fungus &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; and decreased the size of melanized nodules formed in hemolymph, which normally help eliminate infection. Glyphosate also increased the burden of the malaria-causing parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gambiae&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes, altered uninfected mosquito survival, and perturbed the microbial composition of adult mosquito midguts. Our results show that glyphosate’s mechanism of melanin inhibition involves antioxidant synergy and disruption of the reaction oxidation–reduction balance. Overall, these findings suggest that glyphosate’s environmental accumulation could render insects more susceptible to microbial pathogens due to melanin inhibition, immune impairment, and perturbations in microbiota composition, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GZuaIKkRX-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The molecular and metabolic program by which white adipocytes adapt to cool physiologic temperatures</title>

Although visceral adipocytes located within the body’s central core are maintained at approximately 37°C, adipocytes within bone marrow, subcutaneous, and dermal depots are found primarily within the peripheral shell and generally exist at cooler temperatures. Responses of brown and beige/brite adipocytes to cold stress are well studied; however, comparatively little is known about mechanisms by which white adipocytes adapt to temperatures below 37°C. Here, we report that adaptation of cultured adipocytes to 31°C, the temperature at which distal marrow adipose tissues and subcutaneous adipose tissues often reside, increases anabolic and catabolic lipid metabolism, and elevates oxygen consumption. Cool adipocytes rely less on glucose and more on pyruvate, glutamine, and, especially, fatty acids as energy sources. Exposure of cultured adipocytes and gluteal white adipose tissue (WAT) to cool temperatures activates a shared program of gene expression. Cool temperatures induce stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) expression and monounsaturated lipid levels in cultured adipocytes and distal bone marrow adipose tissues (BMATs), and SCD1 activity is required for acquisition of maximal oxygen consumption at 31°C.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HWca-NFdEDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
