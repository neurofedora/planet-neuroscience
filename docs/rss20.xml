	<description>&lt;p&gt;The internal deformation of the brain is far more complex than the rigid
motion of the skull. An ultrasound imaging technique that we have developed has
a combination of penetration, frame-rate, and motion detection accuracy
required to directly observe, for the first time, the formation and evolution
of shear shock waves in the brain. Experiments at low impacts on the traumatic
brain injury scale demonstrate that they are spontaneously generated and
propagate within the porcine brain. Compared to the initially smooth impact,
the acceleration at the shock front is amplified up to a factor of 8.5. This
highly localized increase in acceleration suggests that shear shock waves are a
fundamental mechanism for traumatic injuries in soft tissue.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Models of the cortico-basal ganglia network and volume conductor models of
the brain can provide insight into the mechanisms of action of deep brain
stimulation (DBS). In this study, the coupling of a network model, under
parkinsonian conditions, to the extracellular field distribution obtained from
a three dimensional finite element model of a rodent's brain during DBS is
presented. This coupled model is used to investigate the influence of
uncertainty in the electrical properties of brain tissue and encapsulation
tissue, formed around the electrode after implantation, on the suppression of
oscillatory neural activity during DBS. The resulting uncertainty in this
effect of DBS on the network activity is quantified using a computationally
efficient and non-intrusive stochastic approach based on the generalized
Polynomial Chaos. The results suggest that variations in the electrical
properties of brain tissue may have a substantial influence on the level of
suppression of oscillatory activity during DBS. Applying a global sensitivity
analysis on the suppression of the simulated oscillatory activity showed that
the influence of uncertainty in the electrical properties of the encapsulation
tissue had only a minor influence, in agreement with previous experimental and
computational studies investigating the mechanisms of current-controlled DBS in
the literature.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptive Estimation of the Neural Activation Extent during Deep Brain Stimulation. (arXiv:1705.10478v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10478</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10478</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The aim of this study is to propose an adaptive scheme embedded
into an open-source environment for the estimation of the neural activation
extent during deep brain stimulation and to investigate the feasibility of
approximating the neural activation extent by thresholds of the field solution.
Methods: Open-source solutions for solving the field equation in volume
conductor models of deep brain stimulation and computing the neural activation
are embedded into a Python package to estimate the neural activation in
dependence of the dielectric tissue properties and axon parameters by employing
a spatially adaptive scheme. Feasibility of the approximation of the neural
activation extent by field thresholds is investigated to further reduce the
computational expense. Results: The varying extents of neural activation for
different patient-specific dielectric properties were estimated with the
adaptive scheme. The results revealed the strong influence of the dielectric
properties of the encapsulation layer in the acute and chronic phase after
surgery. The estimated extents using field thresholds were in good agreement
with the determined neural activation extent and data from previous
computational studies. Conclusion: The neural activation extent is altered by
patient-specific parameters. Threshold values of the electric potential and
electric field norm facilitate a computationally efficient method to estimate
the neural activation extent. Significance: The presented adaptive scheme is
able to robustly determine neural activation extents and field threshold
estimates for varying dielectric tissue properties and axon diameters while
reducing substantially the computational expense.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Bispectrum and Its Relationship to Phase-Amplitude Coupling. (arXiv:1705.10435v1 [stat.ME])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measures of nonlinear dependence in time series often take advantage of the
fact that higher-order statistics manifest in the spectral domain as dependence
across frequencies, related to so-called polyspectra. Of these, the most
frequently applied are third-order measures derived from the bispectrum.
Bispectral techniques have found occasional use in EEG literature, but other
forms of cross-frequency dependence commonly regarded as easier to interpret,
have recently attracted greater interest, in particular, phase-amplitude
coupling (PAC). Here it is shown that standard measures of PAC are related to
smoothings of the signal bispectrum, making them fundamentally bispectral
estimators. Viewed this way, however, such measures exhibit some unfavorable
qualities, such as poor bias properties, lack of correct symmetry and
artificial constraints on the spectral range and resolution of the estimate.
Moreover, information obscured by smoothing in measures of PAC, but preserved
in standard bispectral estimators, may be critical for distinguishing nested
oscillations from transient signal features and other non-oscillatory causes of
&quot;spurious&quot; PAC. Future studies of phase-amplitude coupling should therefore
include an explicit evaluation of the bispectrum. Beyond clarifying the
relationship between the bispectrum and PAC, these observations motivate a more
general framework for the interpretation of the bispectrum.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Observability and Synchronization of Neuron Models. (arXiv:1705.10358v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10358</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Observability is the property that enables to distinguish two different
locations in $n$-dimensional state space from a reduced number of measured
variables, usually just one. In high-dimensional systems it is therefore
important to make sure that the variable recorded to perform the analysis
conveys good observability of the system dynamics. In the case of networks
composed of neuron models, the observability of the network depends
nontrivially on the observability of the node dynamics and on the topology of
the network. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, a study of observability
is conducted using four well-known neuron models by computing three different
observability coefficients. This not only clarifies observability properties of
the models but also shows the limitations of applicability of each type of
coefficients in the context of such models. Second, a multivariate singular
spectrum analysis (M-SSA) is performed to detect phase synchronization in
networks composed by neuron models. This tool, to the best of the authors'
knowledge has not been used in the context of networks of neuron models. It is
shown that it is possible to detect phase synchronization i)~without having to
measure all the state variables, but only one from each node, and ii)~without
having to estimate the phase.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes serve as a language for neurons in the brain. Convex codes,
which arise from the pattern of intersections of convex sets in Euclidean
space, are of particular relevance to neuroscience. Not every code is convex,
however, and the combinatorial properties of a code that determine its
convexity are still poorly understood. Here we find that a code that can be
realized by a collection of open convex sets may or may not be realizable by
closed convex sets, and vice versa, establishing that open convex and closed
convex codes are distinct classes. We also prove that max intersection-complete
codes (i.e. codes that contain all intersections of maximal codewords) are both
open convex and closed convex, and provide an upper bound for their minimal
embedding dimension. Finally, we show that the addition of non-maximal
codewords to an open convex code preserves convexity.

Fundamental to the function of nervous systems is the ability to reorganize to cope with changing sensory input. Although well-studied in single neurons, how such adaptive versatility manifests in the collective population dynamics and function of cerebral cortex remains unknown. Here we measured population neural activity with microelectrode arrays in turtle visual cortex while visually stimulating the retina. First, we found that, following the onset of stimulation, adaptation tunes the collective population dynamics towards a special regime with scale-free spatiotemporal activity, after an initial large-scale transient response. Concurrently, we observed an adaptive tradeoff between two important aspects of population coding–sensory detection and discrimination. As adaptation tuned the cortex toward scale-free dynamics, stimulus discrimination was enhanced, while stimulus detection was reduced. Finally, we used a network-level computational model to show that short-term synaptic depression was sufficient to mechanistically explain our experimental results. In the model, scale-free dynamics emerge only when the model operates near a special regime called criticality. Together our model and experimental results suggest unanticipated functional benefits and costs of adaptation near criticality in visual cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y-WBl2q5n1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Semidán Robaina-Estévez, Zoran Nikoloski&lt;/p&gt;

The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several computational approaches to integrate data have been proposed—generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude of equally valid but potentially different models or flux distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been generally recognized, especially in the case of model reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational methods and apply them to two particular case studies: leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression data in a metabolic model of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, and liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with various experimental data sources. The application of these methods allows us to obtain the following results: (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) we sample the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity in both cases. (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally, our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into account for rendering the context-specific metabolic model predictions less ambiguous.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pjL5dHXjc0I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Zoonotic diseases are a major cause of morbidity, and productivity losses in both human and animal populations. Identifying the source of food-borne zoonoses (e.g. an animal reservoir or food product) is crucial for the identification and prioritisation of food safety interventions. For many zoonotic diseases it is difficult to attribute human cases to sources of infection because there is little epidemiological information on the cases. However, microbial strain typing allows zoonotic pathogens to be categorised, and the relative frequencies of the strain types among the sources and in human cases allows inference on the likely source of each infection. We introduce sourceR, an R package for quantitative source attribution, aimed at food-borne diseases. It implements a Bayesian model using strain-typed surveillance data from both human cases and source samples, capable of identifying important sources of infection. The model measures the force of infection from each source, allowing for varying survivability, pathogenicity and virulence of pathogen strains, and varying abilities of the sources to act as vehicles of infection. A Bayesian non-parametric (Dirichlet process) approach is used to cluster pathogen strain types by epidemiological behaviour, avoiding model overfitting and allowing detection of strain types associated with potentially high “virulence”. sourceR is demonstrated using &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; isolate data collected in New Zealand between 2005 and 2008. Chicken from a particular poultry supplier was identified as the major source of campylobacteriosis, which is qualitatively similar to results of previous studies using the same dataset. Additionally, the software identifies a cluster of 9 multilocus sequence types with abnormally high ‘virulence’ in humans. sourceR enables straightforward attribution of cases of zoonotic infection to putative sources of infection. As sourceR develops, we intend it to become an important and flexible resource for food-borne disease attribution studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z3sFxwImY64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Novel mRNA-specific effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rate and polysome profile</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005555</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierre Bonnin, Norbert Kern, Neil T. Young, Ian Stansfield, M. Carmen Romano&lt;/p&gt;

The well established phenomenon of ribosome drop-off plays crucial roles in translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses during protein translation. When cells are under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation or aminoacyl-tRNA depletion due to a high level of recombinant protein expression, ribosome drop-off can substantially affect the efficiency of protein expression. Here we introduce a mathematical model that describes the effects of ribosome drop-off on the ribosome density along the mRNA and on the concomitant protein synthesis rate. Our results show that ribosome premature termination may lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, such as a ribosome density which increases from the 5’ to the 3’ end. Importantly, the model predicts that the effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and we quantify their resilience to drop-off, showing that the mRNAs which present ribosome queues are much less affected by ribosome drop-off than those which do not. Moreover, among those mRNAs that do not present ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, so that sequences using fast codons are expected to be less affected by ribosome drop-off. This result is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, which reveals that under favourable growth conditions mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery, known to be highly codon biased and using preferentially fast codons, are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. Moreover, in physiological conditions, the translation rate of mRNAs coding for regulatory, stress-related proteins, is less resilient to ribosome drop-off. This model therefore allows analysis of variations in the translational efficiency of individual mRNAs by accounting for the full range of known ribosome behaviours, as well as explaining mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lbE6GjC4pk0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamic decomposition of spatiotemporal neural signals</title>

Neural signals are characterized by rich temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics that reflect the organization of cortical networks. Theoretical research has shown how neural networks can operate at different dynamic ranges that correspond to specific types of information processing. Here we present a data analysis framework that uses a linearized model of these dynamic states in order to decompose the measured neural signal into a series of components that capture both rhythmic and non-rhythmic neural activity. The method is based on stochastic differential equations and Gaussian process regression. Through computer simulations and analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the method in identifying meaningful modulations of oscillatory signals corrupted by structured temporal and spatiotemporal noise. These results suggest that the method is particularly suitable for the analysis and interpretation of complex temporal and spatiotemporal neural signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FYBhZcW3Uso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The ability to experimentally perturb biological systems has traditionally been limited to static pre-programmed or operator-controlled protocols. In contrast, real-time control allows dynamic probing of biological systems with perturbations that are computed on-the-fly during experimentation. Real-time control applications for biological research are available; however, these systems are costly and often restrict the flexibility and customization of experimental protocols. The Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI) is an open source software platform for achieving hard real-time data acquisition and closed-loop control in biological experiments while retaining the flexibility needed for experimental settings. RTXI has enabled users to implement complex custom closed-loop protocols in single cell, cell network, animal, and human electrophysiology studies. RTXI is also used as a free and open source, customizable electrophysiology platform in open-loop studies requiring online data acquisition, processing, and visualization. RTXI is easy to install, can be used with an extensive range of external experimentation and data acquisition hardware, and includes standard modules for implementing common electrophysiology protocols.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n2swDY2Viss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>p97 is a “segregase” that plays a key role in numerous ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent pathways such as ER-associated degradation. It has been hypothesized that p97 extracts proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes to enable their proteasomal degradation; however, the complex nature of p97 substrates has made it difficult to directly observe...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/yMXPeM5sLT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>We found that the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is greatly impaired in naa10Δ cells, which lack the NatA Nα-terminal acetylase (Nt-acetylase) and therefore cannot N-terminally acetylate a majority of normally N-terminally acetylated proteins, including Hsp90 and most of its cochaperones.

	<description>The EH-domain–containing protein 2 (EHD2) is a dynamin-related ATPase that confines caveolae to the cell surface by restricting the scission and subsequent endocytosis of these membrane pits. For this, EHD2 is thought to first bind to the membrane, then to oligomerize, and finally to detach, in a stringently regulated mechanistic...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/CgbZOYsK-ps&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Graph coarse-graining reveals differences in the module-level structure of functional brain networks. (arXiv:1705.10170v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10170</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10170</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network analysis is rapidly becoming a standard tool for studying functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In this framework, different brain
areas are mapped to the nodes of a network, whose links depict functional
dependencies between the areas. The sizes of the areas that the nodes portray
vary between studies. Recently, it has been recommended that the original
volume elements, voxels, of the imaging experiment should be used as the
network nodes to avoid artefacts and biases. However, this results in a large
numbers of nodes and links, and the sheer amount of detail may obscure
important network features that are manifested on larger scales. One fruitful
approach to detecting such features is to partition networks into modules, i.e.
groups of nodes that are densely connected internally but have few connections
between them. However, attempting to understand how functional networks differ
by simply comparing their individual modular structures can be a daunting task,
and results may be hard to interpret. We show that instead of comparing
different partitions, it is beneficial to analyze differences in the
connectivity between and within the very same modules in networks obtained
under different conditions. We develop a network coarse-graining methodology
that provides easily interpretable results and allows assessing the statistical
significance of observed differences. The feasibility of the method is
demonstrated by analyzing fMRI data recorded from 13 healthy subjects during
rest and movie viewing. While independent partitioning of the networks
corresponding to the the two conditions yields few insights on their
differences, network coarse-graining allows us to pinpoint e.g. the increased
number of intra-module links within the visual cortex during movie viewing.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The minimization of the length of syntactic dependencies is a well-stablished
principle of word order and the basis of a mathematical theory of word order.
Here we complete that theory from the perspective of information theory, adding
a competing word order principle: the maximization of predictability of a
target element. These two principles are in conflict: to maximize the
predictability of the head, the head should appear last, which maximizes the
costs with respect to dependency length minimization. The implications of such
a broad theoretical framework to understand the optimality, diversity and
evolution of the six possible orderings of subject, object and verb are
reviewed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Personal space (PS) regulation is a key component of effective social
engagement. PS varies among individuals and is regulated by brain circuits
involving the amygdala and the frontoparietal network. Others have reported
that simulated PS intrusions suggest larger preferred interpersonal distance
(PID) and a central role of amygdala hyperactivity in PS regulation in
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). This study is the first report of live
interpersonal distance preferences and relation to specific symptoms in BPD. We
found a 2-fold larger PID in BPD than control (n=30, n=23). There were no
significant differences in PID in BPD subject by medication status or pre-study
diagnosis, and no significant correlations between PID and intensity of BPD,
mood, anxiety, impulsive, or psychotic symptoms. In summary, PID is larger in
BPD than control subjects. Unexpectedly, BPD subject PID did not differ in by
medication status and did not correlate with intensity of any of the symptom
types tested. We discuss these findings in context of severe attachment
disturbances in BPD and the relationship between metaphoric social distance in
the attachment framework. Future work is needed to identify neural circuits
underlying PS regulation in BPD, individual differences in attachment, and
relationship to symptom trajectory.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Intrinsic dynamical fluctuations of PNS myelin ultrastructure. (arXiv:1705.09730v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ultrastructure fluctuations and complex dynamics of the multi-layered
membrane structure of myelin are fundamental for understanding and control its
formation process and the processes associated with degeneration and repair in
neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Myelin is considered a
quasi-crystalline material due to limitations of the available standard
techniques that do not allow to solve heterogeneity and fluctuations in matter
at nanoscale and mesoscale. To overcome this limitation in this work we used
Scanning micro X-ray Diffraction (S{\mu}XRD), which is a unique non-invasive
probe of both k-space and real space allowing to visualize statistical
fluctuations of myelin order with high spatial resolution in real space. We
have used this method to examine the myelin sheath in the sciatic nerve of
Xenopus laevis. We have found that the stable periodic arrangement of myelin is
ensured by large and anti-correlated fluctuations at nanoscale, between
hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers. The correlated disorder of spatial
fluctuations in the functional state is lost with early stage degeneration. Our
results open the way for a deeper understanding of different states such as
degradation and death in biomaterials like neurons, cells and tissues, by
associating these states with dynamical structural fluctuations at the
nanoscale.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Influence Of Study Characteristics On Coordinate-Based fMRI Meta-Analyses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/144071v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/144071v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Given the increasing amount of neuroimaging studies, there is a growing need to summarize published results. Coordinate-based meta-analyses use the locations of statistically significant local maxima with possibly the associated effect sizes to aggregate studies. In this paper, we investigate the influence of key characteristics of a coordinate-based meta-analysis on (1) the balance between false and true positives and (2) the reliability of the outcome from a coordinate-based meta-analysis. More particularly, we consider the influence of the chosen group level model at the study level (fixed effects, ordinary least squares or mixed effects models), the type of coordinate-based meta-analysis (Activation Likelihood Estimation, fixed effects and random effects meta-analysis) and the amount of studies included in the analysis (10, 20 or 35). To do this, we apply a resampling scheme on a large dataset (N = 1400) to create a test condition and compare this with an independent evaluation condition. The test condition corresponds to subsampling participants into studies and combine these using meta-analyses. The evaluation condition corresponds to a high-powered group analysis. We observe the best performance when using mixed effects models in individual studies combined with a random effects meta-analysis. This effect increases with the number of studies included in the meta-analysis. We also show that the popular Activation Likelihood Estimation procedure is a valid alternative, though the results depend on the chosen threshold for significance. Furthermore, this method requires at least 20 to 35 studies. Finally, we discuss the differences, interpretations and limitations of our results.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Monocyte-Lymphocyte Cross-Communication Via Soluble CD163 Directly Links Innate Immune System Activation And Adaptive Immune System Suppression Following Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/144063v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/144063v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>CD163 is a scavenger receptor expressed on innate immune cell populations which can be shed from the plasma membrane via the metalloprotease ADAM17 to generate a soluble peptide with lympho-inhibitory properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate CD163 as a possible effector of stroke-induced adaptive immune system suppression. Liquid biopsies were collected from ischemic stroke patients (n=39), neurologically asymptomatic controls (n=20), and stroke mimics (n=20) within 24 hours of symptom onset. Peripheral blood ADAM17 activity and soluble CD163 levels were elevated in stroke patients relative to non-stroke control groups, and negatively associated with post-stroke lymphocyte counts. Subsequent in vitro experiments suggested that this stroke-induced elevation in circulating soluble CD163 likely originates from activated monocytic cells, as serum from stroke patients stimulated ADAM17-dependant CD163 shedding from healthy donor-derived monocytes. Additional in vitro experiments demonstrated that stroke-induced elevations in circulating soluble CD163 can elicit direct suppressive effects on the adaptive immune system, as serum from stroke patients inhibited the proliferation of healthy donor-derived lymphocytes, an effect which was attenuated following serum CD163 depletion. Collectively, these observations provide novel evidence that the innate immune system employs protective mechanisms aimed at mitigating the risk of post-stroke autoimmune complications driven by adaptive immune system overactivation, and that CD163 is key mediator of this phenomenon.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local Signal Processing In Mouse Horizontal Cell Dendrites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143909v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143909v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The mouse retina contains a single type of horizontal cell, a GABAergic interneuron that samples from all cone photoreceptors within reach and modulates their glutamatergic output via parallel feedback mechanisms. Because horizontal cells form an electrically-coupled network, they have been implicated in global signal processing, such as large scale contrast enhancement. Recently, it has been proposed that horizontal cells can also act locally at the level of individual cone photoreceptor axon terminals. To test this possibility physiologically, we used two-photon microscopy to record light-evoked Ca2+ signals in cone axon terminals and horizontal cell dendrites as well as glutamate release in the outer plexiform layer. By selectively stimulating the two mouse cone opsins with green and UV light, we assessed whether signals from individual cones remain &quot;isolated&quot; within horizontal cell dendritic tips, or whether they spread across the dendritic arbour. Consistent with the mouse's opsin expression gradient, we found that light responses recorded from dendrites of dorsal horizontal cells were dominated by M- and those of ventral horizontal cells by S-opsin activation. Light responses measured in neighbouring horizontal cell dendritic tips varied markedly in their chromatic preference, arguing against global processing. Rather, our data support the idea that horizontal cells can process cone input locally, extending the &quot;classical&quot; view of horizontal cells function. Pharmacologically removing horizontal cells from the circuitry reduced the sensitivity of the cone signal to low frequencies, suggesting that local horizontal cell feedback shapes the temporal properties of cone output.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Different Brain Networks Underlying Intelligence In Autism Spectrum Disorders And Typically Developing Children</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143891v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>There has been sustained clinical and cognitive neuroscience research interest in the neural basis of intelligence. The characterisation of brain structure and function underlying cognitive performance is necessary to understand the neurodevelopment of intelligence across the lifespan, and how associated neural correlates could be perturbed in atypical populations. As most work in this area has focused on neurotypical adults, the nature of functional brain connectivity underlying intelligence in paediatric cohorts with or without abnormal neurodevelopment requires further investigation. We use network-based statistics (NBS) to examine the association between resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) connectivity and fluid intelligence ability in male children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD; M=10.45, SD=1.58 years, n=26) and in matched controls (M=10.38, SD=0.96 years). Compared to typically developing controls strictly matched on age, sex and fluid intelligence scores, boys with ASD displayed a subnetwork (network size=24, p=.0373, FWE-corrected) of significantly increased associations between functional connectivity and fluid intelligence performance. Between-group differences remained significant at a higher edge threshold of t=4 (size=6, p=.0425, FWE-corrected). Results were validated in independent-site replication analyses representing a similar male cohort with ASD (network size=14, p=.0396, FWE-corrected). Regions implicated in atypical ASD fluid intelligence connectivity were the angular gyrus, posterior middle temporal gyrus, occipital and temporo-occipital regions. Across all sites, within-group analyses failed to identify functional connectivity subnetworks associated with fluid or general intelligence performance in matched typically developing males. Findings suggest a prematurely accelerated but aberrant development of fluid intelligence neural correlates in young ASD males, possibly as a compensation mechanism that supports equivalent task performance to controls. The absence of whole-brain network correlates of general and fluid intelligence in young neurotypical males may represent the shift from local to global integration in the development of cognitive ability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional Preference For Object Sounds But Not For Voices In The Occipito-Temporal Cortex Of Early Blind Individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143776v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143776v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sounds activate occipital regions in early blind individuals. How different sound categories map onto specific regions of the occipital cortex remains however debated. We used fMRI to characterize brain responses of early blind and sighted individuals to familiar object sounds, human voices and their respective low-level control sounds. Sighted participants were additionally tested when viewing pictures of faces, objects and phase-scrambled control pictures. In both early blind and sighted, a double dissociation was evidenced in bilateral auditory cortices between responses to voices and object sounds: voices elicited categorical responses in bilateral superior temporal sulci while object sounds elicited categorical responses along the lateral fissure bilaterally, including the primary auditory cortex and planum temporale. Outside of the auditory regions, object sounds additionally elicited categorical responses in left lateral and ventral occipito-temporal regions in both groups. These regions also showed response preference for images of objects in the sighted, thus suggesting a functional specialization in these regions that is independent of sensory input and visual experience. Between-group comparisons revealed that only in the blind group, categorical responses to object sounds extended more posteriorly into the occipital cortex. Functional connectivity analyses evidenced a selective increase in the functional coupling between these reorganized regions and regions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex in the early blind. In contrast, vocal sounds did not elicit preferential responses in the occipital cortex in either group. Nevertheless, enhanced voice-selective connectivity between the left temporal voice area and the right fusiform gyrus were found in the blind. Altogether, these findings suggest that separate auditory categories are not equipotent in driving selective auditory recruitment of occipito-temporal regions in the absence of developmental vision, highlighting domain-region constraints on the expression of crossmodal plasticity.</description>

	<description>The present study demonstrates the Precentral gyrus (PreCG) alteration and its abnormal connectivities in Schizophrenia (SCH) patients. The resting-sate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of healthy control subjects and SCH patients (Centre for Biomedical Research Excellence data set) are used to examine the aberrant functional brain connectome in SCH which contains raw anatomical and functional MR data from 72 patients with Schizophrenia and 75 healthy controls, ranging in age from 18 to 65 years old. Our results show that PreCG has abnormal communication with Thalamus, Hippocampus, Parahippocampal Gyrus (pPaHC), posterior division of Supramarginal Gyrus (pSMG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (p-FDR=0.05).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prediction (Or Not) During Language Processing. A Commentary On Nieuwland et al. (2017) And Delong et al. (2005)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143750v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143750v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The extent to which language processing involves prediction of upcoming inputs remains a question of ongoing debate. One important data point comes from DeLong et al. (2005) who reported that an N400-like event-related potential correlated with a probabilistic index of upcoming input. This result is often cited as evidence for gradient probabilistic prediction of form and/or semantics, prior to the bottom-up input becoming available. However, a recent multi-lab study reports a failure to find these effects (Nieuwland et al., 2017). We review the evidence from both studies, including differences in the design and analysis approach between them. Building on over a decade of research on prediction since DeLong et al. (2005)'s original study, we also begin to spell out the computational nature of predictive processes that one might expect to correlate with ERPs that are evoked by a functional element whose form is dependent on an upcoming predicted word. For paradigms with this type of design, we propose an index of anticipatory processing, Bayesian surprise, and apply it to the updating of semantic predictions. We motivate this index both theoretically and empirically. We show that, for studies of the type discussed here, Bayesian surprise can be closely approximated by another, more easily estimated information theoretic index, the surprisal (or Shannon information) of the input. We re-analyze the data from Nieuwland and colleagues using surprisal rather than raw probabilities as an index of prediction. We find that surprisal is gradiently correlated with the amplitude of the N400, even in the data shared by Nieuwland and colleagues. Taken together, our review suggests that the evidence from both studies is compatible with anticipatory semantic processing. We do, however, emphasize the need for future studies to further clarify the nature and degree of form prediction, as well as its neural signatures, during language comprehension.</description>

	<description>Throughout an animal's postembryonic development, neuronal circuits must maintain appropriate output even as the body grows. The contribution of changes to circuit structure - neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity - to postembryonic circuit development remains unclear. Here, we used new and existing serial section electron microscopy volumes to reconstruct and compare an identified nociceptive circuit in two Drosophila at early and late larval stages. We found extremely consistent, topographically-arranged circuit structure. Five-fold increases in size of interneurons were associated with compensatory structural changes that maintained cell-type-specific synaptic input as a fraction of total inputs. An increase in number of synaptic contacts was accompanied with a disproportionate increase in the number of small dendritic terminal branches relative to other neuronal compartments. We propose that these precise patterns of structural growth act to conserve the computational function of a circuit, for example determining the location of a nociceptive stimulus.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining how synaptic coupling within and between regions is modulated
during sensory processing is an important topic in neuroscience.
Electrophysiological recordings provide detailed information about neural
spiking but have traditionally been confined to a particular region or layer of
cortex. Here we develop new theoretical methods to study interactions between
and within two brain regions, based on experimental measurements of spiking
activity simultaneously recorded from the two regions. By systematically
comparing experimentally-obtained spiking statistics to (efficiently computed)
model spike rate statistics, we identify regions in model parameter space that
are consistent with the experimental data. We apply our new technique to dual
micro-electrode array in vivo recordings from two distinct regions: olfactory
bulb (OB) and anterior piriform cortex (PC). Our analysis predicts that: i)
inhibition within the afferent region (OB) has to be weaker than the inhibition
within PC, ii) excitation from PC to OB is generally stronger than excitation
from OB to PC, iii) excitation from PC to OB and inhibition within PC have to
both be relatively strong compared to presynaptic inputs from OB. These
predictions are validated in a spiking neural network model of the OB--PC
pathway that satisfies the many constraints from our experimental data. We find
when the derived relationships are violated, the spiking statistics no longer
satisfy the constraints from the data. In principle this modeling framework can
be adapted to other systems and be used to investigate relationships between
other neural attributes besides network connection strengths. Thus, this work
can serve as a guide to further investigations into the relationships of
various neural attributes within and across different regions during sensory
processing.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Efficient and accurate extraction of in vivo calcium signals from microendoscopic video data. (arXiv:1605.07266v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07266</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In vivo calcium imaging through microscopes has enabled deep brain imaging of
previously inaccessible neuronal populations within the brains of freely moving
subjects. However, microendoscopic data suffer from high levels of background
fluorescence as well as an increased potential for overlapping neuronal
signals. Previous methods fail in identifying neurons and demixing their
temporal activity because the cellular signals are often submerged in the large
fluctuating background. Here we develop an efficient method to extract cellular
signals with minimal influence from the background. We model the background
with two realistic components: (1) one models the constant baseline and slow
trends of each pixel, and (2) the other models the fast fluctuations from
out-of-focus signals and is therefore constrained to have low spatial-frequency
structure. This decomposition avoids cellular signals being absorbed into the
background term. After subtracting the background approximated with this model,
we use Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF, Pnevmatikakis et al.
(2016)) to better demix neural signals and get their denoised and deconvolved
temporal activity. We validate our method on simulated and experimental data,
where it shows fast, reliable, and high quality signal extraction under a wide
variety of imaging parameters.

	<description>There is an ongoing need to improve animal models for investigating human behavior and its biological underpinnings. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a promising model in cognitive neuroscience. However, before it can contribute to advances in this field in a comparative, reliable, and valid manner, several methodological issues warrant attention. We review recent non-invasive canine neuroscience studies, primarily focusing on (i) variability among dogs and between dogs and humans in cranial characteristics, and (ii) generalizability across dog and dog–human studies.</description>

	<description>Truncating CHD8 mutations are amongst the highest confidence risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) identified to date. To investigate how reduced Chd8 gene dosage may disrupt brain development and predispose individuals to ASD, we generated a Chd8 heterozygous mouse model. In line with clinical observations, we found that Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed subtle brain hyperplasia and hypertelorism, coupled with increased postnatal brain weight. Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed anomalous behaviours, but autism-like social deficits, repetitive and restricted behaviours were not present. Only minor gene expression changes were observed in the embryonic neocortex at E12.5, with more pronounced gene expression changes in postnatal cortex at P5. Differentially expressed genes showed highly significant enrichment for known autism candidates. Amongst the down-regulated transcripts, genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance were particularly prominent, implicating impaired connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the ASD phenotype. To probe this further, we performed resting state functional fMRI and found increased synchronised activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks, hinting at impaired sensory processing. Together, these data show that Chd8 heterozygous mice recapitulate key clinical features found in patients with CHD8 mutations and show a unique combination of behavioural phenotypes, which may be underpinned by a distinctive disruption of brain connectivity and sensory processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Early And Late Components Of EEG Delay Activity Correlate Differently With Scene Working Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143461v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143461v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sustained and elevated activity during the working memory delay period has long been considered the primary neural correlate for maintaining information over short time intervals. This idea has recently been reinterpreted in light of findings generated from multiple neural recording modalities and levels of analysis. To further investigate the sustained or transient nature of activity, the temporal-spectral evolution (TSE) of delay period activity was examined in humans with high density EEG during performance of a Sternberg working memory paradigm with a relatively long six second delay and with novel scenes as stimuli. Sensor level analyses revealed transient rather than sustained activity during delay periods. Specifically, high amplitude activity encompassing the theta range was found early, during the first three seconds of the delay and correlated positively with subsequent ability to distinguish new from old probe scenes. Later, toward the end of the delay, lower amplitude activity encompassing the alpha/beta range was found that negatively correlated with subsequent ability to distinguish probes. Source level signal estimation implicated a right parietal region of transient early delay activity that correlated positively with working memory ability. Importantly, varying the trial temporal window duration and changing the baseline period for computation of TSE activity were found to influence the strength of the correlations obtained. This pattern of results adds to recent evidence that transient rather than sustained delay period activity supports visual working memory performance. The findings are discussed in relation to synchronous and desynchronous intra- and inter-regional neural transmission, and choosing an optimal baseline for expressing temporal-spectral delay activity change.</description>

	<description>Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful tool to understand cell classes in neural circuits. In cortex, however, the identification of distinct biological cell types based on transcriptomic data is complicated by the existence of many incompletely-understood and closely-related neural classes, which can also show continuous variation in gene expression. The inhibitory cells of hippocampal area CA1 have been extensively characterized, leading to 23 currently defined cell types that provide a Rosetta Stone for transcriptomic analysis. Here, we studied the transcriptomes of 3638 CA1 inhibitory cells. Novel clustering methods identified all 23 previously described CA1 inhibitory types, while also suggesting 6 new inhibitory classes. Latent-factor analysis revealed a common continuum of expression of many genes within and between classes, which we hypothesized correlates with a continuum from faster-spiking cells that proximally target pyramidal cells, to slower active cells targeting pyramidal distal dendrites or interneurons. In vitro patch-seq of Pvalb interneurons supported hypothesis.</description>

	<description>Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent networks, e.g. the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally. Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and robust computation at the population level.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Global Effects Of Focal Brain Tumours On Functional Complexity And Network Robustness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/142844v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/142844v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Neurosurgical management of brain tumours has entered a new paradigm of supra-marginal resections that demands thorough understanding of their peri-tumoural functional effects. Historically the effects of tumours have been considered as local, and long-range effects have not been considered. This work tests the hypothesis that focal tumours affect the brain at a global level producing long-range gradients in cortical function. Methods: Resting state functional (f)MRI data were acquired from 11 participants with glioblastoma and split into discovery and validation datasets. Fractal complexity was computed with a wavelet-based estimator of the Hurst exponent. Distance related effects of the tumours were tested with a tumour mask dilation technique and parcellation of the underlying Hurst maps. Functional connectivity networks were constructed and validated with different parcellation and statistical dependency methods prior to graph theory analysis. Results: Fractal complexity, measured through the Hurst exponent and tumour mask dilation technique, demonstrates a penumbra of suppression in the peri-tumoural region. At a global level, as distance from the tumour increases, this initial suppression is balanced by a subsequent over-activity before finally normalizing. These effects were best fit by a quadratic model, and were consistent across different network construction pipelines. The Hurst exponent was significantly correlated with multiple graph theory measures of centrality including network robustness, but graph theory measures did not demonstrate distance dependent effects. Conclusions: This work provides evidence to support the theory that focal brain tumours produce long-range and non-linear gradients in function. Consequently the effects of focal lesions, and the resultant clinical effects, need to be interpreted in terms of the global changes on whole brain functional complexity and network architecture rather than purely in terms of functional localisation. Determining whether the peri-tumoural changes represent adaption or potential plasticity, for example, may facilitate extended resection of the tumour without functional cost.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Improving tauG-Control Of Action In PD</title>

	<description>A theory of action control (General Tau Theory) is applied to analyzing normal and abnormal movements in PD; and to designing and testing the efficacy of a sonic aid for PD. A central aspect of the theory, which is supported by experimental evidence across a variety of actions and species, is that the trajectories of competent skilled actions follow a particular temporal pattern, which is described by the mathematical function, tauG. Since tauG-control of actions can be largely deficient in PD, we designed a device that generates whoop-like sounds, where the fundamental frequency of the sound follows the tauG pattern. Our hypothesis was that by listening to these sounds the nervous system of someone with PD might be helped subsequently to self-generate tauG patterns in their nervous system, which might facilitate movement control in different situations. Five adults with PD, and five age-matched controls, took part in the study. They each listened to the sounds under two conditions: (a) experimental - turning a handle for 5 minutes while the sounds were played (b) control - turning the handle without the sounds. Before and after each condition, the tauG-control of lateral body sway while standing was measured (without the sounds playing), using force-plates, on two tasks: (i) keeping the feet down, (ii) lifting the trailing foot. The number of participants out of five, who showed greater ratio improvement following practice with whoop sounds compared to without sounds, was, on each task, high for the PDs compared with the age-matched controls (4 vs 2 or 3). Thus, for the PDs, listening to the tauG whoop-like sounds while performing one action (handle turning) improved subsequent tauG-control on a different task (body-swaying).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sleep Benefits Memory For Semantic Category Structure While Preserving Exemplar-Specific Information</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143172v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Semantic memory encompasses knowledge about both the properties that typify concepts (e.g. robins, like all birds, have wings) as well as the properties that individuate conceptually related items (e.g. robins, in particular, have red breasts). We investigate the impact of sleep on new semantic learning using a property inference task in which both kinds of information are initially acquired equally well. Participants learned about three categories of novel objects possessing some properties that were shared among category exemplars and others that were unique to an exemplar, with exposure frequency varying across categories. In Experiment 1, memory for shared properties improved and memory for unique properties was preserved across a night of sleep, while memory for both feature types declined over a day awake. In Experiment 2, memory for shared properties improved across a nap, but only for the lower-frequency category, suggesting a prioritization of weakly learned information early in a sleep period. The increase was significantly correlated with amount of REM, but was also observed in participants who did not enter REM, suggesting involvement of both sleep stages. The results provide the first evidence that sleep improves memory for the shared structure of object categories, while simultaneously preserving object-unique information.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sodium intake and multiple sclerosis activity and progression in BENEFIT</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24965</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess whether a high-salt diet, as measured by urinary sodium concentration, is associated with faster conversion from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to multiple sclerosis (MS) and MS activity and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: BENEFIT was a randomized clinical trial comparing early versus delayed interferon beta-1b treatment in 465 patients with a CIS. Each patient provided a median of 14 (IQR: 13 to 16) spot urine samples throughout the 5-year follow-up. We estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion level at each time point using the Tanaka equations, and assessed whether sodium levels estimated from the cumulative average of the repeated measures were associated with clinical (conversion to MS, EDSS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Average 24-hour urine sodium levels were not associated with conversion to clinically-definite MS over the 5-year follow-up (hazard ratio [HR]=0.91; 95% CI: 0.67-1.24 per 1g increase in estimated daily sodium intake); nor were they associated with clinical or MRI outcomes (new active lesions after 6 months HR: 1.05; 95% CI 0.97-1.13; relative change in T2 lesion volume: -0.11; 95% CI -0.25-0.04; change in EDSS: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.09-0.08; relapse rate HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.56-1.07). Results were similar in categorical analyses using quintiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results, based on multiple assessments of urine sodium excretion over 5 years and standardized clinical and MRI follow-up, suggest that salt intake does not influence MS disease course or activity.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) leads to a wide range of neurological symptoms. Ketogenic diets are very efficient to control epilepsy and movement disorders. We tested a novel simple and rapid blood test in 30 patients with GLUT1-DS with predominant movement disorders, 18 patients with movement disorders due to other genetic defects and 346 healthy controls. We detected significantly reduced GLUT1 expression only on red blood cells from patients with GLUT1-DS (23 patients, 78%), including patients with inconclusive genetic analysis. This test opens perspectives for the screening of GLUT1-DS in children and adults with cognitive impairment, movement disorder or epilepsy. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated the association of Alzheimer's disease-related rare variants &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T and &lt;em&gt;ABCA7&lt;/em&gt; rs200538373-C with the levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) and parameters of metabolic and cardiovascular health in a population-based cohort of healthy middle-aged and elderly men. Carriers of protective &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T variant had on average 28% lower levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in plasma as compared to the controls and the carriers of &lt;em&gt;ABCA7&lt;/em&gt; rs200538373-C. This is the first report to show decreased Aβ levels in plasma in &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T carriers and thus provides evidence that lower Aβ levels throughout the life may be protective against Alzheimer's disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The genetic landscape of familial congenital hydrocephalus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24964</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24964</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Congenital hydrocephalus is an important birth defect, the genetics of which remains incompletely understood. To date, only four genes are known to cause Mendelian diseases in which congenital hydrocephalus is the main or sole clinical feature, two X-linked (&lt;em&gt;L1CAM&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;AP1S2&lt;/em&gt;) and two autosomal recessive (&lt;em&gt;CCDC88C&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MPDZ&lt;/em&gt;). In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic etiology of familial congenital hydrocephalus with the assumption that these cases represent Mendelian forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Exome sequencing combined, where applicable, with positional mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We identified a likely causal mutation in the majority of these families (21/27, 78%), spanning 16 genes, none of which is X-linked. Ciliopathies and dystroglycanopathies were the most common etiologies of congenital hydrocephalus in our cohort (19% and 26%, respectively). In one family with four affected members, we identified a homozygous truncating variant in &lt;em&gt;EML1&lt;/em&gt;, which we propose as a novel cause of congenital hydrocephalus in addition to its suggested role in cortical malformation. Similarly, we show that recessive mutations in &lt;em&gt;WDR81&lt;/em&gt;, previously linked to cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium syndrome 2, cause severe congenital hydrocephalus. Furthermore, we confirm the previously reported candidacy of &lt;em&gt;MPDZ&lt;/em&gt; by presenting a phenotypic spectrum of congenital hydrocephalus associated with five recessive alleles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Our study highlights the importance of recessive mutations in familial congenital hydrocephalus and expands the locus heterogeneity of this condition.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Differential Neuronal Susceptibility and Apoptosis in Congenital ZIKV Infection</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the mechanism of ZIKV-associated microcephaly, we perform immunolabeling on brain tissue from a 20-week fetus with intrauterine ZIKV infection. While ZIKV demonstrated a wide range of neuronal and non-neuronal tropism, the infection rate was highest in intermediate progenitor cells and immature neurons. Apoptosis was observed in both infected and uninfected bystander cortical neurons, suggesting a role for paracrine factors in induction of neuronal apoptosis. Our results highlight differential neuronal susceptibility and neuronal apoptosis as potential mechanisms in the development of ZIKV-associated microcephaly, and may provide insights into the design and best timing of future therapy.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Status Epilepticus is common in neonates and infants, and is associated with neuronal injury and adverse developmental outcomes. GABAergic drugs, the standard treatment for neonatal seizures, can have excitatory effects in the neonatal brain, which may worsen the seizures and their effects. Using a recently developed model of status epilepticus in P7 rat pups that results in widespread neuronal injury, we found that the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonists phenobarbital and midazolam significantly increased Status Epilepticus-associated neuronal injury in various brain regions. Our results suggest that more research is needed into the possible deleterious effects of GABAergic drugs on neonatal seizures and on excitotoxic neuronal injury in the immature brain.

	<description>A theory of action control (General Tau Theory) is applied to analyzing the vocalizations of human neonates. A central aspect of the theory, which is supported by experimental evidence across various actions and species, is that the trajectories of competent skilled actions follow a particular temporal pattern, which is described by the mathematical function, tauG. It was found that the acoustic waveform of vocalizations of healthy, full-term babies followed the tauG pattern with high precision. We conclude that healthy full-term neonates can be born with the ability to tauG-guide their vocalizations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Decoding The Influence Of Anticipatory States On Visual Perception In The Presence Of Temporal Distractors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143123v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>While it has long been recognised that anticipatory states amplify early EEG responses to visual targets in humans, it remains unclear how such modulations relate to the actual content of the neural representation, and help prioritise targets among temporally competing distractor stimuli. Using multivariate orientation decoding of high temporal resolution EEG recordings, we first demonstrate that anticipation also increases the amount of stimulus-identity information contained in these early brain responses. By characterising the influence of temporally adjacent distractors on target identity decoding, we additionally reveal that anticipation does not just attenuate distractor interference on target representations but, instead, delay it. Enhanced target decoding and distractor resistance are further predicted by the attenuation of posterior 8-14 Hz alpha oscillations. These findings offer several novel insights into how anticipatory states shape neural representations in service of resolving sensory competition in time, and they highlight the potential of non-invasive multivariate electrophysiology to track cognitive influences on perception in tasks with rapidly changing displays.</description>

	<description>Nervous systems control purposeful movement, both within and outside the body, which is essential for the survival of an animal. The movement control functions of globus pallidus (GP), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and zona incerta (ZI) were analyzed in monkeys reaching for seen targets. Temporal profiles of the hand movements of monkeys and the synchronized flow of electrochemical energy through these basal ganglia were analyzed in terms of a theory of goal-directed movement. Theoretical and empirical analysis indicated: (i) the neural information for controlling movement is the relative-rate-of-change of flow of electrochemical energy in neurons rather than the flow itself; (ii) GP is involved in creating prospective electrochemical flow to guide movement; (iii) STN is involved in registering the perceptual electrochemical flow monitoring the movement; (iv) ZI is involved in integrating the prospective and perceptual electrochemical flows to power the muscles and thence the movement. Possible implications for PD are discussed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Rapid feedback responses are flexibly coordinated across arm muscles to support goal-directed reaching</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/143008v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Rapid feedback responses can be evoked in wrist muscles when elbow muscles are unexpectedly stretched during goal-directed reaching. Here we examined the flexibility of this coordination. Participants used a planar three degree-of-freedom (shoulder, elbow, wrist) exoskeleton robot to move a cursor to a target following an elbow flexion perturbation. In our first experiment, the cursor was mapped to the veridical position of the robot handle, but participants grasped the handle with two different hand orientations (thumb pointing upward or thumb point downward). We found that large long-latency stretch responses (i.e., muscle activity 50-100 ms following a perturbation) were evoked in wrist extensor muscles when wrist extension helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb upward), and in wrist flexor muscles when wrist flexion helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb downward). In our second experiment, participants grasped the robot handle with their thumb pointing upward, but the cursor's movement was either veridical, or was mirrored such that flexing the wrist moved the cursor as if the participant extended their wrist, and vice versa. We found that, after extensive training, large long-latency stretch responses were evoked in wrist flexor muscles when wrist flexion helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., mirror mapping), and in wrist extensor muscles when wrist extension helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., veridical mapping). Taken together, our findings highlight the flexible routing of long-latency stretch responses and how this coordination supports goal-directed reaching.</description>

	<description>The monogenic and monoallelic expression of only one out of &amp;gt;1000 olfactory receptor (ORs) genes requires the formation of large heterochromatic chromatin domains that sequester the OR gene clusters. Within these domains, intergenic transcriptional enhancers evade heterochromatic silencing and converge into interchromosomal hubs that assemble over the transcriptionally active OR. The significance of this nuclear organization in OR choice remains elusive. Here, we show that transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf specify OR enhancers by binding in a functionally cooperative fashion to stereotypically spaced motifs that defy heterochromatin. Specific displacement of Lhx2 and Ebf from OR enhancers resulted in pervasive, long-range, and trans downregulation of OR transcription, whereas pre-assembly of a multi-enhancer hub increased the frequency of OR choice in cis. Our data provide genetic support for the requirement and sufficiency of interchromosomal interactions in singular OR choice and generate general regulatory principles for stochastic, mutually exclusive gene expression programs.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Chemomechanical regulation of myosin Ic cross-bridges: Deducing the elastic properties of an ensemble from single-molecule mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005566</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Berger, A. J. Hudspeth&lt;/p&gt;

Myosin Ic is thought to be the principal constituent of the motor that adjusts mechanical responsiveness during adaptation to prolonged stimuli by hair cells, the sensory receptors of the inner ear. In this context myosin molecules operate neither as filaments, as occurs in muscles, nor as single or few molecules, as characterizes intracellular transport. Instead, myosin Ic molecules occur in a complex cluster in which they may exhibit cooperative properties. To better understand the motor’s remarkable function, we introduce a theoretical description of myosin Ic’s chemomechanical cycle based on experimental data from recent single-molecule studies. The cycle consists of distinct chemical states that the myosin molecule stochastically occupies. We explicitly calculate the probabilities of the occupancy of these states and show their dependence on the external force, the availability of actin, and the nucleotide concentrations as required by thermodynamic constraints. This analysis highlights that the strong binding of myosin Ic to actin is dominated by the ADP state for small external forces and by the ATP state for large forces. Our approach shows how specific parameter values of the chemomechanical cycle for myosin Ic result in behaviors distinct from those of other members of the myosin family. Integrating this single-molecule cycle into a simplified ensemble description, we predict that the average number of bound myosin heads is regulated by the external force and nucleotide concentrations. The elastic properties of such an ensemble are determined by the average number of myosin cross-bridges. Changing the binding probabilities and myosin’s stiffness under a constant force results in a mechanical relaxation which is large enough to account for fast adaptation in hair cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0ZTpS15B6Gs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: GSplit LBI: Taming the Procedural Bias in Neuroimaging for Disease Prediction. (arXiv:1705.09249v1 [stat.AP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09249</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09249</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In voxel-based neuroimage analysis, lesion features have been the main focus
in disease prediction due to their interpretability with respect to the related
diseases. However, we observe that there exists another type of features
introduced during the preprocessing steps and we call them &quot;\textbf{Procedural
Bias}&quot;. Besides, such bias can be leveraged to improve classification accuracy.
Nevertheless, most existing models suffer from either under-fit without
considering procedural bias or poor interpretability without differentiating
such bias from lesion ones. In this paper, a novel dual-task algorithm namely
\emph{GSplit LBI} is proposed to resolve this problem. By introducing an
augmented variable enforced to be structural sparsity with a variable splitting
term, the estimators for prediction and selecting lesion features can be
optimized separately and mutually monitored by each other following an
iterative scheme. Empirical experiments have been evaluated on the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\thinspace(ADNI) database. The advantage of
proposed model is verified by improved stability of selected lesion features
and better classification results.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Firing rate equations require a spike synchrony mechanism to correctly describe fast oscillations in inhibitory networks. (arXiv:1705.09205v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09205</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09205</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrently coupled networks of inhibitory neurons robustly generate
oscillations in the gamma band. Nonetheless, the corresponding Wilson-Cowan
type firing rate equation for such an inhibitory population does not generate
such oscillations without an explicit time delay. We show that this discrepancy
is due to a voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent in
networks of spiking neurons which is not captured by standard firing rate
equations. Here we investigate an exact low-dimensional description for a
network of heterogeneous canonical type-I inhibitory neurons which includes the
sub-threshold dynamics crucial for generating synchronous states. In the limit
of slow synaptic kinetics the spike-synchrony mechanism is suppressed and the
standard Wilson-Cowan equations are formally recovered as long as external
inputs are also slow. However, even in this limit synchronous spiking can be
elicited by inputs which fluctuate on a time-scale of the membrane
time-constant of the neurons. Our meanfield equations therefore represent an
extension of the standard Wilson-Cowan equations in which spike synchrony is
also correctly described.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The 'free energy principle' (FEP) has been suggested to provide a unified
theory of the brain, integrating data and theory relating to action,
perception, and learning. The theory and implementation of the FEP combines
insights from Helmholtzian 'perception as inference', machine learning theory,
and statistical thermodynamics. Here, we provide a detailed mathematical
evaluation of a suggested biologically plausible implementation of the FEP that
has been widely used to develop the theory. Our objectives are (i) to describe
within a single article the mathematical structure of this implementation of
the FEP; (ii) provide a simple but complete agent-based model utilising the
FEP; (iii) disclose the assumption structure of this implementation of the FEP
to help elucidate its significance for the brain sciences.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently regained popularity, with major
achievements such as beating the European game of Go champion. Here, for the
first time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural
network (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an
external classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal
coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less
activated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron
was assigned to an object category, and it was assumed that the stimulus
category was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was
correct, the neuron was rewarded, i.e. spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
was applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP
was applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As
demonstrated on various image datasets (Caltech, ETH-80, and NORB), this reward
modulated STDP (R-STDP) approach extracted particularly discriminative visual
features, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that
consistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP outperformed STDP on these datasets.
Furthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning, and can adapt to drastic
changes such as label permutations. Finally, it is worth mentioning that both
feature extraction and classification were done with spikes, using at most one
spike per neuron. Thus the network is hardware friendly and energy efficient.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computational neuroscience models have been used for understanding neural
dynamics in the brain and how they may be altered when physiological or other
conditions change. We review and develop a data-driven approach to neuroimaging
data called the energy landscape analysis. The methods are rooted in
statistical physics theory, in particular the Ising model, also known as the
(pairwise) maximum entropy model and Boltzmann machine. The methods have been
applied to fitting electrophysiological data in neuroscience for a decade, but
their use in neuroimaging data is still in its infancy. We first review the
methods and discuss some algorithms and technical aspects. Then, we apply the
methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging data recorded from healthy
individuals to inspect the relationship between the accuracy of fitting, the
size of the brain system to be analyzed, and the data length.

	<description>Many mammalian species, including humans, exhibit social behavior and form complex social groups. Mechanistic studies in animal models have revealed important roles for the endocannabinoid signaling system, comprising G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid-derived agonists, in the control of neural processes that underpin social anxiety and social reward, two key aspects of social behavior. An emergent insight from these studies is that endocannabinoid signaling in specific circuits of the brain is context dependent and selectively recruited.</description>

Differential expression analysis is one of the most common types of analyses performed on various biological data (e.g. RNA-seq or mass spectrometry proteomics). It is the process that detects features, such as genes or proteins, showing statistically significant differences between the sample groups under comparison. A major challenge in the analysis is the choice of an appropriate test statistic, as different statistics have been shown to perform well in different datasets. To this end, the reproducibility-optimized test statistic (ROTS) adjusts a modified &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistic according to the inherent properties of the data and provides a ranking of the features based on their statistical evidence for differential expression between two groups. ROTS has already been successfully applied in a range of different studies from transcriptomics to proteomics, showing competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods. To promote its widespread use, we introduce here a Bioconductor R package for performing ROTS analysis conveniently on different types of omics data. To illustrate the benefits of ROTS in various applications, we present three case studies, involving proteomics and RNA-seq data from public repositories, including both bulk and single cell data. The package is freely available from Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ROTS).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DYXIcc0UsEg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Networks are a way to represent interactions among one (e.g., social networks) or more (e.g., plant-pollinator networks) classes of nodes. The ability to predict likely, but unobserved, interactions has generated a great deal of interest, and is sometimes referred to as the &lt;i&gt;link prediction problem&lt;/i&gt;. However, most studies of link prediction have focused on social networks, and have assumed a completely censused network. In biological networks, it is unlikely that all interactions are censused, and ignoring incomplete detection of interactions may lead to biased or incorrect conclusions. Previous attempts to predict network interactions have relied on known properties of network structure, making the approach sensitive to observation errors. This is an obvious shortcoming, as networks are dynamic, and sometimes not well sampled, leading to incomplete detection of links. Here, we develop an algorithm to predict missing links based on conditional probability estimation and associated, node-level features. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and then apply it to a desert small mammal host-parasite network. Our approach achieves high accuracy on simulated and observed data, providing a simple method to accurately predict missing links in networks without relying on prior knowledge about network structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BWP9hhpjUqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A vast amount of work has been dedicated to the effects of hemodynamics and cytokines on leukocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration (TEM) and subsequent accumulation of leukocyte-derived foam cells in the artery wall. However, a comprehensive mechanobiological model to capture these spatiotemporal events and predict the growth and remodeling of an atherosclerotic artery is still lacking. Here, we present a multiscale model of leukocyte TEM and plaque evolution in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The approach integrates cellular behaviors via agent-based modeling (ABM) and hemodynamic effects via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this computational framework, the ABM implements the diffusion kinetics of key biological proteins, namely Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Tissue Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interlukin-10 (IL-10) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β), to predict chemotactic driven leukocyte migration into and within the artery wall. The ABM also considers wall shear stress (WSS) dependent leukocyte TEM and compensatory arterial remodeling obeying Glagov’s phenomenon. Interestingly, using fully developed steady blood flow does not result in a representative number of leukocyte TEM as compared to pulsatile flow, whereas passing WSS at peak systole of the pulsatile flow waveform does. Moreover, using the model, we have found leukocyte TEM increases monotonically with decreases in luminal volume. At critical plaque shapes the WSS changes rapidly resulting in sudden increases in leukocyte TEM suggesting lumen volumes that will give rise to rapid plaque growth rates if left untreated. Overall this multi-scale and multi-physics approach appropriately captures and integrates the spatiotemporal events occurring at the cellular level in order to predict leukocyte transmigration and plaque evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XrRy6p2WmJs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

What does it take to convert a heap of sequencing data into a publishable result? First, common tools are employed to reduce primary data (sequencing reads) to a form suitable for further analyses (i.e., the list of variable sites). The subsequent exploratory stage is much more ad hoc and requires the development of custom scripts and pipelines, making it problematic for biomedical researchers. Here, we describe a hybrid platform combining common analysis pathways with the ability to explore data interactively. It aims to fully encompass and simplify the &quot;raw data-to-publication&quot; pathway and make it reproducible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kOnvMgs1_PQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Short and random: Modelling the effects of (proto-)neural elongations. (arXiv:1705.08756v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand how neurons and nervous systems first evolved, we need an
account of the origins of neural elongations: Why did neural elongations (axons
and dendrites) first originate, such that they could become the central
component of both neurons and nervous systems? Two contrasting conceptual
accounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg's vehicles
provide the iconic illustration of the dominant input-output (IO) view. Here
the basic role of neural elongations is to connect sensors to effectors, both
situated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural
elongations are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections,
which require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes
to build. Internal coordination (IC) models stress a different function for
early nervous systems. Here the coordination of activity across extended parts
of a multicellular body is held central, in particular for the contractions of
(muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest
proto-neural elongations could have been functional even when they were
initially simple short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the
patterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present
computational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random
neural elongations can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can
generate basic forms of patterning for small body-configurations, adding
elongations allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies. This result
supports a new, more gradual evolutionary route towards the origins of the very
first full neurons and nervous systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum theory of time perception: phases,clocks and quantum algebra. (arXiv:1705.08753v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experience of time is one of the primordial human experiences which is deeply
tied to human consciousness. But despite this intimate relation of time with
human conscious experience, time has proved to be very elusive. Particularly in
physics, though there is already some understanding of time, there are still so
many paradoxes that plague this understanding. In this paper we take rather a
different route to question of time. We first attempt to come up with a
theoretical understanding of time perception. Quite interestingly we find that
quantum theory provides an algebraic formulation within which we can understand
some essential aspects of time perception by human mind. We then ask whether a
similar formalism can furnish the understanding of time as well and find
connections of our formulation of time with similar works by other researchers.
Our underlying approach to question of time has been inspired by R. W. Hamilton
who considers algebra as science of pure time. Hence our work has an extensive
algebraic flavor. Our work also incorporates another approach based on
Kauffman's iterant algebra which relates time to underlying recursions and
oscillations. We believe that our work will initiate more investigations in
this direction.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spontaneous cortical activity is transiently poised close to criticality</title>

Brain activity displays a large repertoire of dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle and even during anesthesia. It was suggested that criticality could serve as a unifying principle underlying the diversity of dynamics. This view has been supported by the observation of spontaneous bursts of cortical activity with scale-invariant sizes and durations, known as neuronal avalanches, in recordings of mesoscopic cortical signals. However, the existence of neuronal avalanches in spiking activity has been equivocal with studies reporting both its presence and absence. Here, we show that signs of criticality in spiking activity can change between synchronized and desynchronized cortical states. We analyzed the spontaneous activity in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat and the awake monkey, and found that neuronal avalanches and thermodynamic indicators of criticality strongly depend on collective synchrony among neurons, LFP fluctuations, and behavioral state. We found that synchronized states are associated to criticality, large dynamical repertoire and prolonged epochs of eye closure, while desynchronized states are associated to sub-criticality, reduced dynamical repertoire, and eyes open conditions. Our results show that criticality in cortical dynamics is not stationary, but fluctuates during anesthesia and between different vigilance states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uSwcz9bYNaM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feature-Selective Attention Adaptively Shifts Noise Correlations in Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5378?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5378?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory environments often contain an overwhelming amount of information, with both relevant and irrelevant information competing for neural resources. Feature attention mediates this competition by selecting the sensory features needed to form a coherent percept. How attention affects the activity of populations of neurons to support this process is poorly understood because population coding is typically studied through simulations in which one sensory feature is encoded without competition. Therefore, to study the effects of feature attention on population-based neural coding, investigations must be extended to include stimuli with both relevant and irrelevant features. We measured noise correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt;) within small neural populations in primary auditory cortex while rhesus macaques performed a novel feature-selective attention task. We found that the effect of feature-selective attention on &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; depended not only on the population tuning to the attended feature, but also on the tuning to the distractor feature. To attempt to explain how these observed effects might support enhanced perceptual performance, we propose an extension of a simple and influential model in which shifts in &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; can simultaneously enhance the representation of the attended feature while suppressing the distractor. These findings present a novel mechanism by which attention modulates neural populations to support sensory processing in cluttered environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although feature-selective attention constitutes one of the building blocks of listening in natural environments, its neural bases remain obscure. To address this, we developed a novel auditory feature-selective attention task and measured noise correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt;) in rhesus macaque A1 during task performance. Unlike previous studies showing that the effect of attention on &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; depends on population tuning to the attended feature, we show that the effect of attention depends on the tuning to the distractor feature as well. We suggest that these effects represent an efficient process by which sensory cortex simultaneously enhances relevant information and suppresses irrelevant information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) subserves top-down regulation of attention and working memory abilities. Depletion studies show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) is essential to dlPFC working memory functions, but the receptor and cellular bases for cholinergic actions are just beginning to be understood. The current study found that nicotinic receptors comprised of α4 and β2 subunits (α4β2-nAChR) enhance the task-related firing of delay and fixation cells in the dlPFC of monkeys performing a working memory task. Iontophoresis of α4β2-nAChR agonists increased the neuronal firing and enhanced the spatial tuning of delay cells, neurons that represent visual space in the absence of sensory stimulation. These enhancing effects were reversed by coapplication of a α4β2-nAChR antagonist, consistent with actions at α4β2-nAChR. Delay cell firing was reduced when distractors were presented during the delay epoch, whereas stimulation of α4β2-nAChR protected delay cells from these deleterious effects. Iontophoresis of α4β2-nAChR agonists also enhanced the firing of fixation cells, neurons that increase firing when the monkey initiates a trial, and maintain firing until the trial is completed. These neurons are thought to contribute to sustained attention and top-down motor control and have never before been the subject of pharmacological inquiry. These findings begin to build a picture of the cellular actions underlying the beneficial effects of ACh on attention and working memory. The data may also help to explain why genetic insults to α4 subunits are associated with working memory and attentional deficits and why α4β2-nAChR agonists may have therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The acetylcholine (ACh) arousal system in the brain is needed for robust attention and working memory functions, but the receptor and cellular bases for its beneficial effects are poorly understood in the newly evolved primate brain. The current study found that ACh stimulation of nicotinic receptors comprised of α4 and β2 subunits (α4β2-nAChR) enhanced the firing of neurons in the primate prefrontal cortex that subserve top-down attentional control and working memory. α4β2-nAChR stimulation also protected neuronal responding from the detrimental effects of distracters presented during the delay epoch, when information is held in working memory. These results illuminate how ACh strengthens higher cognition and help to explain why genetic insults to the α4 subunit weaken cognitive and attentional abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: APLP1 Is a Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule, Supporting Maintenance of Dendritic Spines and Basal Synaptic Transmission</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key player in Alzheimer's disease, belongs to the family of synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) due to its impact on synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. These functions are mediated by both the secreted APP ectodomain that acts as a neurotrophic factor and full-length APP forming &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cellular dimers. Two homologs of APP exist in mammals: the APP like proteins APLP1 and APLP2, exhibiting functions that partly overlap with those of APP. Here we tested whether APLP1 and APLP2 also show features of SAMs. We found that all three family members were upregulated during postnatal development coinciding with synaptogenesis. We observed presynaptic and postsynaptic localization of all APP family members and could show that heterologous expression of APLP1 or APLP2 in non-neuronal cells induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of cocultured neurons, similar to APP and other SAMs. Moreover, APP/APLPs all bind to synaptic-signaling molecules, such as MINT/X11. Furthermore, we report that aged APLP1 knock-out mice show impaired basal transmission and a reduced mEPSC frequency, likely resulting from reduced spine density. This demonstrates an essential nonredundant function of APLP1 at the synapse. Compared to APP, APLP1 exhibits increased &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cellular binding and elevated cell-surface levels due to reduced endocytosis. In conclusion, our results establish that APLPs show typical features of SAMs and indicate that increased surface expression, as observed for APLP1, is essential for proper synapse formation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and synapse maintenance &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; According to the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the accumulation of Aβ peptides derived from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and -secretase. Here we show that all mammalian APP family members (APP, APLP1, and APLP2) exhibit synaptogenic activity, involving &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic dimerization, similar to other synaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as Neuroligin/Neurexin. Importantly, our study revealed that the loss of APLP1, which is one of the major substrates of BACE1, causes reduced spine density in aged mice. Because some therapeutic interventions target APP processing (e.g., BACE inhibitors), those strategies may alter APP/APLP physiological function. This should be taken into account for the development of pharmaceutical treatments of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spatial Attention, Motor Intention, and Bayesian Cue Predictability in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5334?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictions about upcoming events influence how we perceive and respond to our environment. There is increasing evidence that predictions may be generated based upon previous observations following Bayesian principles, but little is known about the underlying cortical mechanisms and their specificity for different cognitive subsystems. The present study aimed at identifying common and distinct neural signatures of predictive processing in the spatial attentional and motor intentional system. Twenty-three female and male healthy human volunteers performed two probabilistic cueing tasks with either spatial or motor cues while lying in the fMRI scanner. In these tasks, the percentage of cue validity changed unpredictably over time. Trialwise estimates of cue predictability were derived from a Bayesian observer model of behavioral responses. These estimates were included as parametric regressors for analyzing the BOLD time series. Parametric effects of cue predictability in valid and invalid trials were considered to reflect belief updating by precision-weighted prediction errors. The brain areas exhibiting predictability-dependent effects dissociated between the spatial attention and motor intention task, with the right temporoparietal cortex being involved during spatial attention and the left angular gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex during motor intention. Connectivity analyses revealed that all three areas showed predictability-dependent coupling with the right hippocampus. These results suggest that precision-weighted prediction errors of stimulus locations and motor responses are encoded in distinct brain regions, but that crosstalk with the hippocampus may be necessary to integrate new trialwise outcomes in both cognitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain is able to infer the environments' statistical structure and responds strongly to expectancy violations. In the spatial attentional domain, it has been shown that parts of the attentional networks are sensitive to the predictability of stimuli. It remains unknown, however, whether these effects are ubiquitous or if they are specific for different cognitive systems. The present study compared the influence of model-derived cue predictability on brain activity in the spatial attentional and motor intentional system. We identified areas with distinct predictability-dependent activation for spatial attention and motor intention, but also common connectivity changes of these regions with the hippocampus. These findings provide novel insights into the generality and specificity of predictive processing signatures in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Variable Action Potential Backpropagation during Tonic Firing and Low-Threshold Spike Bursts in Thalamocortical But Not Thalamic Reticular Nucleus Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5319?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are indispensable in dendritic signaling. Conflicting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-imaging data and an absence of dendritic recording data means that the extent of backpropagation in thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons remains unknown. Because TRN neurons signal electrically through dendrodendritic gap junctions and possibly via chemical dendritic GABAergic synapses, as well as classical axonal GABA release, this lack of knowledge is problematic. To address this issue, we made two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings from rat TC and TRN neuron dendrites to measure bAPs directly. These recordings reveal that &quot;tonic&quot;' and low-threshold-spike (LTS) &quot;burst&quot; APs in both cell types are always recorded first at the soma before backpropagating into the dendrites while undergoing substantial distance-dependent dendritic amplitude attenuation. In TC neurons, bAP attenuation strength varies according to firing mode. During LTS bursts, somatic AP half-width increases progressively with increasing spike number, allowing late-burst spikes to propagate more efficiently into the dendritic tree compared with spikes occurring at burst onset. Tonic spikes have similar somatic half-widths to late burst spikes and undergo similar dendritic attenuation. In contrast, in TRN neurons, AP properties are unchanged between LTS bursts and tonic firing and, as a result, distance-dependent dendritic attenuation remains consistent across different firing modes. Therefore, unlike LTS-associated global electrical and calcium signals, the spatial influence of bAP signaling in TC and TRN neurons is more restricted, with potentially important behavioral-state-dependent consequences for synaptic integration and plasticity in thalamic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In most neurons, action potentials (APs) initiate in the axosomatic region and propagate into the dendritic tree to provide a retrograde signal that conveys information about the level of cellular output to the locations that receive most input: the dendrites. In thalamocortical and thalamic reticular nucleus neurons, the site of AP generation and the true extent of backpropagation remain unknown. Using patch-clamp recordings, this study measures dendritic propagation of APs directly in these neurons. In either cell type, high-frequency low-threshold spike burst or lower-frequency tonic APs undergo substantial voltage attenuation as they spread into the dendritic tree. Therefore, backpropagating spikes in these cells can only influence signaling in the proximal part of the dendritic tree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decreased Motor Neuron Support by SMA Astrocytes due to Diminished MCP1 Secretion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5309?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe, often fatal muscle weakness due to loss of motor neurons. SMA patients have deletions and other mutations of the &lt;i&gt;survival of motor neuron 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene, resulting in decreased SMN protein. Astrocytes are the primary support cells of the CNS and are responsible for glutamate clearance, metabolic support, response to injury, and regulation of signal transmission. Astrocytes have been implicated in SMA as in in other neurodegenerative disorders. Astrocyte-specific rescue of SMN protein levels has been shown to mitigate disease manifestations in mice. However, the mechanism by which SMN deficiency in astrocytes may contribute to SMA is unclear and what aspect of astrocyte activity is lacking is unknown. Therefore, it is worthwhile to identify defects in SMN-deficient astrocytes that compromise normal function. We show here that SMA astrocyte cultures derived from mouse spinal cord of both sexes are deficient in supporting both WT and SMN-deficient motor neurons derived from male, female, and mixed-sex sources and that this deficiency may be mitigated with secreted factors. In particular, SMN-deficient astrocytes have decreased levels of monocyte chemoactive protein 1 (MCP1) secretion compared with controls and MCP1 restoration stimulates outgrowth of neurites from cultured motor neurons. Correction of MCP1 deficiency may thus be a new therapeutic approach to SMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by the loss of motor neurons, but astrocyte dysfunction also contributes to the disease in mouse models. Monocyte chemoactive protein 1 (MCP1) has been shown to be neuroprotective and is released by astrocytes. Here, we report that MCP1 levels are decreased in SMA mice and that replacement of deficient MCP1 increases differentiation and neurite length of WT and SMN-deficient motor-neuron-like cells in cell culture. This study reveals a novel aspect of astrocyte dysfunction in SMA and indicates a possible approach for improving motor neuron growth and survival in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Illusory Reversal in Tactile Temporal Order by the Phase of Posterior {alpha} Rhythm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5298?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5298?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The subjective temporal order of tactile stimuli, delivered sequentially to each hand with an interval of 100–300 ms, is often inverted when the arms are crossed. Based on data from behavioral and neuroimaging studies, it has been proposed that the reversal is due to a conflict between anatomical and spatial representations of the tactile signal or to the production of an inverted apparent motion signal. Because the α rhythms, which consist of a few distinct components, reportedly modulate tactile perception and apparent motion and serve as a 10 Hz timer, we hypothesized that the illusory reversal would be regulated by some of the α rhythms. To test this hypothesis, we conducted magnetoencephalographic recordings in both male and female participants during the tactile temporal order judgment task. We decomposed the α rhythms into five independent components and discovered that the illusory reversal was modulated by the phase of one independent component with strong current sources near the parieto-occipital (PO) sulcus (peri-PO component). As expected, the estimated current sources distributed over the human MST implicated to represent tactile apparent motion, in addition to the intraparietal region implicated in mapping tactile signals in space. However, the strongest source was located in the precuneus that occupies a central hub region in the cortical networks and receives tactile inputs through a tecto-thalamic pathway. These results suggest that the peri-PO component plays an essential role in regulating tactile temporal perception by modulating the thalamic nuclei that interconnect the superior colliculus with the cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite a long-held hypothesis that the posterior α rhythm serves as a 10 Hz timer that regulates human temporal perception, the contribution of the α rhythms in temporal perception is still unclear. We examined how the α rhythms influence tactile temporal order judgment. Judgment reversal depended on the phase of one particular α rhythm with its source near the parieto-occipital sulcus. The peri-parieto-occipital α rhythm may play a crucial role in organizing tactile temporal perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Privileged Functional Connectivity between the Visual Word Form Area and the Language System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5288?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region in the left occipitotemporal sulcus of literate individuals that is purportedly specialized for visual word recognition. However, there is considerable controversy about its functional specificity and connectivity, with some arguing that it serves as a domain-general, rather than word-specific, visual processor. The VWFA is a critical region for testing hypotheses about the nature of cortical organization, because it is known to develop only through experience (i.e., reading acquisition), and widespread literacy is too recent to have influenced genetic determinants of brain organization. Using a combination of advanced fMRI analysis techniques, including individual functional localization, multivoxel pattern analysis, and high-resolution resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses, with data from 33 healthy adult human participants, we demonstrate that (1) the VWFA can discriminate words from nonword letter strings (pseudowords); (2) the VWFA has preferential RSFC with Wernicke's area and other core regions of the language system; and (3) the strength of the RSFC between the VWFA and Wernicke's area predicts performance on a semantic classification task with words but not other categories of visual stimuli. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the VWFA is specialized for lexical processing of real words because of its functional connectivity with Wernicke's area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The visual word form area (VWFA) is critical for determining the nature of category-related organization of the ventral visual system. However, its functional specificity and connectivity are fiercely debated. Recent work concluded that the VWFA is a domain-general, rather than word-specific, visual processor with no preferential functional connectivity with the language system. Using more advanced techniques, our results stand in stark contrast to these earlier findings. We demonstrate that the VWFA is highly specialized for lexical processing of real words, and that a fundamental factor driving this specialization is its preferential intrinsic functional connectivity with core regions of the language system. Our results support the hypothesis that intrinsic functional connectivity contributes to category-related specialization within the human ventral visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Being First Matters: Topographical Representational Similarity Analysis of ERP Signals Reveals Separate Networks for Audiovisual Temporal Binding Depending on the Leading Sense</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5274?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5274?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In multisensory integration, processing in one sensory modality is enhanced by complementary information from other modalities. Intersensory timing is crucial in this process because only inputs reaching the brain within a restricted temporal window are perceptually bound. Previous research in the audiovisual field has investigated various features of the temporal binding window, revealing asymmetries in its size and plasticity depending on the leading input: auditory–visual (AV) or visual–auditory (VA). Here, we tested whether separate neuronal mechanisms underlie this AV–VA dichotomy in humans. We recorded high-density EEG while participants performed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task including various AV–VA asynchronies and unisensory control conditions (visual-only, auditory-only) and tested whether AV and VA processing generate different patterns of brain activity. After isolating the multisensory components of AV–VA event-related potentials (ERPs) from the sum of their unisensory constituents, we ran a time-resolved topographical representational similarity analysis (tRSA) comparing the AV and VA ERP maps. Spatial cross-correlation matrices were built from real data to index the similarity between the AV and VA maps at each time point (500 ms window after stimulus) and then correlated with two alternative similarity model matrices: AV&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; versus AV&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt;. The tRSA results favored the AV&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; model across all time points, suggesting that audiovisual temporal binding (indexed by synchrony perception) engages different neural pathways depending on the leading sense. The existence of such dual route supports recent theoretical accounts proposing that multiple binding mechanisms are implemented in the brain to accommodate different information parsing strategies in auditory and visual sensory systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Intersensory timing is a crucial aspect of multisensory integration, determining whether and how inputs in one modality enhance stimulus processing in another modality. Our research demonstrates that evaluating synchrony of auditory-leading (AV) versus visual-leading (VA) audiovisual stimulus pairs is characterized by two distinct patterns of brain activity. This suggests that audiovisual integration is not a unitary process and that different binding mechanisms are recruited in the brain based on the leading sense. These mechanisms may be relevant for supporting different classes of multisensory operations, for example, auditory enhancement of visual attention (AV) and visual enhancement of auditory speech (VA).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Loss Promotes Astrocytic Phagocytosis and Microglial Activation in Mouse Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5263?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5263?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously found that &lt;i&gt;Mertk&lt;/i&gt; and its ligand &lt;i&gt;Gas6&lt;/i&gt;, astrocytic genes involved in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6–8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (~5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low-level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Seminal studies of the thalamocortical circuit in the visual system of the cat have been central to our understanding of sensory encoding. However, thalamocortical synaptic properties remain poorly understood. We used paired recordings, in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1), to provide the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; characterization of sensory-driven thalamocortical potentials in V1. The amplitudes of EPSPs we characterized were smaller than those previously reported &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Consistent with prior findings, connected LGN-V1 pairs were only found when their receptive fields (RFs) overlapped, and the probability of connection increased steeply with degree of RF overlap and response similarity. However, surprisingly, we found no relationship between EPSP amplitudes and the similarity of RFs or responses, suggesting different connectivity models for intracortical and thalamocortical circuits. Putative excitatory regular-spiking (RS) and inhibitory fast-spiking (FS) V1 cells had similar EPSP characteristics, showing that in the visual system, feedforward excitation and inhibition are driven with equal strength by the thalamus. Similar to observations in the somatosensory cortex, FS V1 cells received less specific input from LGN. Finally, orientation tuning in V1 was not inherited from single presynaptic LGN cells, suggesting that it must emerge exclusively from the combined input of all presynaptic LGN cells. Our results help to decipher early visual encoding circuits and have immediate utility in providing physiological constraints to computational models of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To understand how the brain encodes the visual environment, we must understand the transfer of visual signals between various regions of the brain. Therefore, understanding synaptic dynamics is critical to our understanding of sensory encoding. This study provides the first characterization of visually evoked synaptic potentials between the visual thalamus and visual cortex in an intact animal. To record these potentials, we simultaneously recorded the extracellular potential of presynaptic thalamic cells and the intracellular potential of postsynaptic cortical cells in input layers of primary visual cortex. Our characterization of synaptic potentials &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disagreed with prior findings &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This study will increase our understanding of thalamocortical circuits and will improve computational models of visual encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural Similarities between Neuregulin 1-3 Isoforms Determine Their Subcellular Distribution and Signaling Mode in Central Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5232?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5232?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Neuregulin (NRG) family of ErbB ligands is comprised of numerous variants originating from the use of different genes, alternative promoters, and splice variants. NRGs have generally been thought to be transported to axons and presynaptic terminals where they signal via ErbB3/4 receptors in paracrine or juxtacrine mode. However, we recently demonstrated that unprocessed pro-NRG2 accumulates on cell bodies and proximal dendrites, and that NMDAR activity is required for shedding of its ectodomain by metalloproteinases. Here we systematically investigated the subcellular distribution and processing of major NRG isoforms in rat hippocampal neurons. We show that NRG1 isotypes I and II, which like NRG2 are single-pass transmembrane proteins with an Ig-like domain, share the same subcellular distribution and ectodomain shedding properties. We furthermore show that NRG3, like CRD-NRG1, is a dual-pass transmembrane protein that harbors a second transmembrane domain near its amino terminus. Both NRG3 and CRD-NRG1 cluster on axons through juxtacrine interactions with ErbB4 present on GABAergic interneurons. Interestingly, although single-pass NRGs accumulate as unprocessed proforms, axonal puncta of CRD-NRG1 and NRG3 are comprised of processed protein. Mutations of CRD-NRG1 and NRG3 that render them resistant to BACE cleavage, as well as BACE inhibition, result in the loss of axonal puncta and in the accumulation of unprocessed proforms in neuronal soma. Together, these results define two groups of NRGs with distinct membrane topologies and fundamentally different targeting and processing properties in central neurons. The implications of this functional diversity for the regulation of neuronal processes by the NRG/ErbB pathway are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Numerous Neuregulins (NRGs) are generated through the use of different genes, promoters, and alternative splicing, but the functional significance of this evolutionary conserved diversity remains poorly understood. Here we show that NRGs can be categorized by their membrane topologies. Single-pass NRGs, such as NRG1 Types I/II and NRG2, accumulate as unprocessed proforms on cell bodies, and their ectodomains are shed by metalloproteinases in response to NMDA receptor activation. By contrast, dual-pass CRD-NRG1 and NRG3 are constitutively processed by BACE and accumulate on axons where they interact with ErbB4 in juxtacrine mode. These findings reveal a previously unknown functional relationship between membrane topology, protein processing, and subcellular distribution, and suggest that single- and dual-pass NRGs regulate neuronal functions in fundamentally different ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Allometric Analysis Detects Brain Size-Independent Effects of Sex and Sex Chromosome Complement on Human Cerebellar Organization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is a large hindbrain structure that is increasingly recognized for its contribution to diverse domains of cognitive and affective processing in human health and disease. Although several of these domains are sex biased, our fundamental understanding of cerebellar sex differences—including their spatial distribution, potential biological determinants, and independence from brain volume variation—lags far behind that for the cerebrum. Here, we harness automated neuroimaging methods for cerebellar morphometrics in 417 individuals to (1) localize normative male–female differences in raw cerebellar volume, (2) compare these to sex chromosome effects estimated across five rare sex (X/Y) chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) syndromes, and (3) clarify brain size-independent effects of sex and SCA on cerebellar anatomy using a generalizable allometric approach that considers scaling relationships between regional cerebellar volume and brain volume in health. The integration of these approaches shows that (1) sex and SCA effects on raw cerebellar volume are large and distributed, but regionally heterogeneous, (2) human cerebellar volume scales with brain volume in a highly nonlinear and regionally heterogeneous fashion that departs from documented patterns of cerebellar scaling in phylogeny, and (3) cerebellar organization is modified in a brain size-independent manner by sex (relative expansion of total cerebellum, flocculus, and Crus II-lobule VIIIB volumes in males) and SCA (contraction of total cerebellar, lobule IV, and Crus I volumes with additional X- or Y-chromosomes; X-specific contraction of Crus II-lobule VIIIB). Our methods and results clarify the shifts in human cerebellar organization that accompany interwoven variations in sex, sex chromosome complement, and brain size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar systems are implicated in diverse domains of sex-biased behavior and pathology, but we lack a basic understanding of how sex differences in the human cerebellum are distributed and determined. We leverage a rare neuroimaging dataset to deconvolve the interwoven effects of sex, sex chromosome complement, and brain size on human cerebellar organization. We reveal topographically variegated scaling relationships between regional cerebellar volume and brain size in humans, which (1) are distinct from those observed in phylogeny, (2) invalidate a traditional neuroimaging method for brain volume correction, and (3) allow more valid and accurate resolution of which cerebellar subcomponents are sensitive to sex and sex chromosome complement. These findings advance understanding of cerebellar organization in health and sex chromosome aneuploidy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in neuroscience suggests that
organisms represent or model their environment by minimizing a variational
free-energy bound on the surprise associated with sensory signals from the
environment. In this paper, we study phase transitions in coupled dissipative
dynamical systems (complex Ginzburg-Landau equations) under a variety of
coupling conditions to model the exchange of a system (agent) with its
environment. We show that arbitrary coupling between sensory signals and the
internal state of a system -- or those between its action and external
(environmental) states -- do not guarantee synchronous dynamics between
external and internal states: the spatial structure and the temporal dynamics
of sensory signals and action (that comprise the system's Markov blanket) have
to be pruned to produce synchrony. This synchrony is necessary for an agent to
infer environmental states -- a pre-requisite for survival. Therefore, such
sentient dynamics, relies primarily on approximate synchronization between the
agent and its niche.

Chromosomal organization in 3D plays a central role in regulating cell-type specific transcriptional and DNA replication timing programs. Yet it remains unclear to what extent the resulting long-range contacts depend on specific molecular drivers. Here we propose a model that comprehensively assesses the influence on contacts of DNA-binding proteins, cis-regulatory elements and DNA consensus motifs. Using real data, we validate a large number of predictions for long-range contacts involving known architectural proteins and DNA motifs. Our model outperforms existing approaches including enrichment test, random forests and correlation, and it uncovers numerous novel long-range contacts in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and human. The model uncovers the orientation-dependent specificity for long-range contacts between CTCF motifs in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, highlighting its conserved property in 3D organization of metazoan genomes. Our model further unravels long-range contacts depending on co-factors recruited to DNA indirectly, as illustrated by the influence of cohesin in stabilizing long-range contacts between CTCF sites. It also reveals asymmetric contacts such as enhancer-promoter contacts that highlight opposite influences of the transcription factors EBF1, EGR1 or MEF2C depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oZ3iZ-1Rv7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

These rats show accumulation of microtubules throughout the cytoplasm as well as arrays along the endoplasmic reticulum of oligodendrocytes, as can be seen in the cytoplasm ringing the nucleus of this cell. The oligodendrocyte is surrounded by hypomyelinated and demyelinated axons, which are also seen in many patients with mutations in TUBB4A.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apolipoprotein-related MOrtality RISk study, we enrolled 636,132 men and women during 1985–1996 in Stockholm, Sweden, with measurements of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were either directly measured or calculated from total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoA-I. The cohort was followed until the end of 2011. We used Cox models and mixed-effects models to, first, estimate the associations between these biomarkers and ALS incidence and, second, to assess the changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years before ALS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-unit increase of LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.27), apoB (HR = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.17–2.42), and apoB/apoA-I ratio (HR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.29–2.78) was associated with a higher incidence of ALS. High glucose level (≥6.11mmol/L) was associated with a lower incidence (HR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.42–0.93), whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C (≥3.50; HR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.15–1.96) and high apoB/apoA-I (≥0.90 for men, ≥0.8 for women; HR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.04–1.90) ratios were associated with a higher incidence. During the 10 years before diagnosis, ALS patients had increasing levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB, and apoA-I, whereas gradually decreasing levels of LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the carbohydrate, lipid, and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with ALS risk and may serve as prodromal symptoms decades before ALS diagnosis. The imbalance between apoB and apoA-I as well as between LDL-C and HDL-C may be an etiological mechanism for ALS and needs to be further studied.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Are midsagittal tissue bridges predictive of outcome after cervical spinal cord injury?</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At 1 month postinjury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at 1 month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1-year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion size and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global exosome transcriptome profiling reveals biomarkers for multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24931</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and &amp;gt;50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative polymerase chain reaction with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected, 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients versus HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p, and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNAs was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNAs were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro secretion of these miRNAs by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Because putative targets for these miRNAs include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus, exosomal miRNAs might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish multiple sclerosis relapse. Ann Neurol 2017;81:703–717&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tailoring epilepsy surgery with fast ripples in the intraoperative electrocorticogram</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) can be used to delineate the resection area in epilepsy surgery. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80–500 Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and postresection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs; 250–500 Hz) and ripples (80–250 Hz), and spikes in pre- and postresection ECoG sampled at 2,048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of electroencephalography (EEG) event occurrence: pre+post− (+/−), pre+post+ (+/+), pre−post+ (−/+) and pre−post− (−/−). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement; lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement; and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG events, time to recurrence, and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free vs recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 54 patients (median age, 15.5 years; 25 months of follow-up; 30 seizure free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples, or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/−, +/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio, 3.13; confidence interval = 1.22–6.25; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01). Seven of 8 patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRs that persist before and after resection predict poor postsurgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intraoperative ECoG measurements.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized clinical trial of deep brain stimulation for poststroke pain</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for pain is largely based on uncontrolled studies targeting the somatosensory pathways, with mixed results. We hypothesized that targeting limbic neural pathways would modulate the affective sphere of pain and alleviate suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of DBS targeting the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule (VS/ALIC) in 10 patients with poststroke pain syndrome. One month after bilateral DBS, patients were randomized to active DBS or sham for 3 months, followed by crossover for another 3-month period. The primary endpoint was a ≥50% improvement on the Pain Disability Index in 50% of patients with active DBS compared to sham. This 6-month blinded phase was followed by an 18-month open stimulation phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine participants completed randomization. Although this trial was negative for its primary and secondary endpoints, we did observe significant differences in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain (eg, Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Affective Pain Rating Index of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire). Fourteen serious adverse events were recorded and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;VS/ALIC DBS to modulate the affective sphere of pain represents a paradigm shift in chronic pain management. Although this exploratory study was negative for its primary endpoint, VS/ALIC DBS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and statistically significant improvements on multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain. Therefore, we believe these results justify further work on neuromodulation therapies targeting the affective sphere of pain.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, 1.06–1.55; 1.42, 1.10–1.84, respectively), whereas disease-modifying drug (DMD) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI = 0.75, 0.60–0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMD exposure decreased the risk of a first Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-worsening event (HR, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.42–0.83; 0.75, 0.71–0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse increased this risk (HR, 95% CI = 5.08, 3.46–7.46). An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significantly higher incidence of a first EDSS-worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMD exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS-worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work represents a step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMD treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to KCNC1 mutation: Analysis of 20 cases and K+ channel properties</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical, electroclinical, and neuroimaging data for 20 patients with MEAK due to recurrent &lt;em&gt;KCNC1&lt;/em&gt; p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch-clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms began at between 3 and 15 years of age (median = 9.5), with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic–clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early, but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; 10 patients were wheelchair-bound by their late teenage years. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges, with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG–electromyographic studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, which appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in 6 patients. To explore this, we performed high-temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures, there was a robust leftward shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1, increasing channel availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation, resembling Unverricht–Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent leftward shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 subunit–containing channels, which would counter the loss of function observed for mutant channels, highlighting &lt;em&gt;KCNC1&lt;/em&gt; as a potential target for precision therapeutics.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The repetition of behavioral assessments in diagnosis of disorders of consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24962</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24962</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine whether repeated examinations using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised have an impact on diagnostic accuracy of patients with disorders of consciousness and to provide guidelines regarding the number of assessments required for obtaining a reliable diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 123 adult patients with chronic disorders of consciousness were referred to our tertiary center. They were assessed at least 6 times with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised within a 10-day period. Clinical diagnoses based on 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessments were compared with a reference diagnosis (i.e., the highest behavioral diagnosis obtained after 6 evaluations) using non-parametric statistics. Results were considered significant at &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The number of assessments had a significant effect on the clinical diagnosis. Up to the fourth examination, the diagnosis was still statistically different from the reference diagnosis based on 6 CRS-R assessments. Compared to this reference diagnosis, the first evaluation led to 36% of misdiagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The number of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessments has an impact on the clinical diagnosis of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness. Up to the fourth examinations, behavioral fluctuations may still impact the diagnostic accuracy. We here suggest performing at least 5 assessments in each patient with disorders of consciousness within a short time interval (e.g., 2 weeks) to reduce misdiagnosis.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neuroimaging Biomarkers and Impaired Olfaction in Cognitively Normal Individuals</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: There is a need for inexpensive non-invasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n=829) to assess a composite Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-Pittsburgh compound B (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB; n=306) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG; n=305) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among 829 CN participants (mean age 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score &amp;lt;6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope=-.43; (95%CI -.77, -.09); p=.01 and slope=-.72; (95%CI -1.15, -.28); &amp;lt;.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest that OI may be a non-invasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment, and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials.

As proteins are synthesized, the nascent polypeptide must pass through a negatively charged exit tunnel. During this stage, positively charged stretches can interact with the ribosome walls and slow the translation. Therefore, charged polypeptides may be important factors that affect protein expression. To determine the frequency and distribution of positively and negatively charged stretches in different proteomes, the net charge was calculated for every 30 consecutive amino acid residues, which corresponds to the length of the ribosome exit tunnel. The following annotated and reviewed proteins in the UniProt database (Swiss-Prot) were analyzed: 551,705 proteins from different organisms and a total of 180 million protein segments. We observed that there were more negative than positive stretches and that super-charged positive sequences (i.e., net charges ≥ 14) were underrepresented in the proteomes. Overall, the proteins were more positively charged at their N-termini and C-termini, and this feature was present in most organisms and subcellular localizations. To investigate whether the N-terminal charges affect the elongation rates, previously published ribosomal profiling data obtained from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, without translation-interfering drugs, were analyzed. We observed a nonlinear effect of the charge on the ribosome occupancy in which values ≥ +5 and ≤ -6 showed increased and reduced ribosome densities, respectively. These groups also showed different distributions across 80S monosomes and polysomes. Basic polypeptides are more common within short proteins that are translated by monosomes, whereas negative stretches are more abundant in polysome-translated proteins. These findings suggest that the nascent peptide charge impacts translation and can be one of the factors that regulate translation efficiency and protein expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kxt6p83cHKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances focusing on the metabolic interactions within and between cellular populations have emphasized the importance of microbial communities for human health. Constraint-based modeling, with flux balance analysis in particular, has been established as a key approach for studying microbial metabolism, whereas individual-based modeling has been commonly used to study complex dynamics between interacting organisms. In this study, we combine both techniques into the R package BacArena (https://cran.r-project.org/package=BacArena) to generate novel biological insights into &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation as well as a seven species model community of the human gut. For our &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; model, we found that cross-feeding of fermentation products cause a spatial differentiation of emerging metabolic phenotypes in the biofilm over time. In the human gut model community, we found that spatial gradients of mucus glycans are important for niche formations which shape the overall community structure. Additionally, we could provide novel hypothesis concerning the metabolic interactions between the microbes. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial and temporal multi-scale modeling approaches such as BacArena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHxdBudYIgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-scale computational study of the mechanical regulation of cell mitotic rounding in epithelia</title>

Mitotic rounding during cell division is critical for preventing daughter cells from inheriting an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition that occurs frequently in cancer cells. Cells must significantly expand their apical area and transition from a polygonal to circular apical shape to achieve robust mitotic rounding in epithelial tissues, which is where most cancers initiate. However, how cells mechanically regulate robust mitotic rounding within packed tissues is unknown. Here, we analyze mitotic rounding using a newly developed multi-scale subcellular element computational model that is calibrated using experimental data. Novel biologically relevant features of the model include separate representations of the sub-cellular components including the apical membrane and cytoplasm of the cell at the tissue scale level as well as detailed description of cell properties during mitotic rounding. Regression analysis of predictive model simulation results reveals the relative contributions of osmotic pressure, cell-cell adhesion and cortical stiffness to mitotic rounding. Mitotic area expansion is largely driven by regulation of cytoplasmic pressure. Surprisingly, mitotic shape roundness within physiological ranges is most sensitive to variation in cell-cell adhesivity and stiffness. An understanding of how perturbed mechanical properties impact mitotic rounding has important potential implications on, amongst others, how tumors progressively become more genetically unstable due to increased chromosomal aneuploidy and more aggressive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x6-F3T8uB38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: PyLDM - An open source package for lifetime density analysis of time-resolved spectroscopic data</title>

Ultrafast spectroscopy offers temporal resolution for probing processes in the femto- and picosecond regimes. This has allowed for investigation of energy and charge transfer in numerous photoactive compounds and complexes. However, analysis of the resultant data can be complicated, particularly in more complex biological systems, such as photosystems. Historically, the dual approach of global analysis and target modelling has been used to elucidate kinetic descriptions of the system, and the identity of transient species respectively. With regards to the former, the technique of lifetime density analysis (LDA) offers an appealing alternative. While global analysis approximates the data to the sum of a small number of exponential decays, typically on the order of 2-4, LDA uses a semi-continuous distribution of 100 lifetimes. This allows for the elucidation of lifetime distributions, which may be expected from investigation of complex systems with many chromophores, as opposed to averages. Furthermore, the inherent assumption of linear combinations of decays in global analysis means the technique is unable to describe dynamic motion, a process which is resolvable with LDA. The technique was introduced to the field of photosynthesis over a decade ago by the Holzwarth group. The analysis has been demonstrated to be an important tool to evaluate complex dynamics such as photosynthetic energy transfer, and complements traditional global and target analysis techniques. Although theory has been well described, no open source code has so far been available to perform lifetime density analysis. Therefore, we introduce a python (2.7) based package, PyLDM, to address this need. We furthermore provide a direct comparison of the capabilities of LDA with those of the more familiar global analysis, as well as providing a number of statistical techniques for dealing with the regularization of noisy data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dEpjjfoGzDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;During embryonic development, spinal commissural axons extend towards the floor plate (FP), guided by the axon guidance molecule netrin 1, but the source of netrin 1 is a matter of debate. In the developing spinal cord, netrin 1 is expressed by FP cells and progenitor &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory formation requires representations of new information to be efficiently encoded by the brain memory network. Here, the authors used multivariate classification to determine encoding states that were predictive of later recall and those that were likely to lead to forgetting. In people with epilepsy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic mechanisms — including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning — regulate gene expression, cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the brain. In adulthood, changes in the epigenome are crucial for higher cognitive functions such as learning and &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sodium Channel Nav1.8 Underlies TTX-Resistant Axonal Action Potential Conduction in Somatosensory C-Fibers of Distal Cutaneous Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5204?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are responsible for the initiation and conduction of action potentials within primary afferents. The nine Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms recognized in mammals are often functionally divided into tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (TTX-s) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) that are blocked by nanomolar concentrations and TTX-resistant (TTX-r) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9) inhibited by millimolar concentrations, with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5 having an intermediate toxin sensitivity. For small-diameter primary afferent neurons, it is unclear to what extent different Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms are distributed along the peripheral and central branches of their bifurcated axons. To determine the relative contribution of TTX-s and TTX-r channels to action potential conduction in different axonal compartments, we investigated the effects of TTX on C-fiber-mediated compound action potentials (C-CAPs) of proximal and distal peripheral nerve segments and dorsal roots from mice and pigtail monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;). In the dorsal roots and proximal peripheral nerves of mice and nonhuman primates, TTX reduced the C-CAP amplitude to 16% of the baseline. In contrast, &amp;gt;30% of the C-CAP was resistant to TTX in distal peripheral branches of monkeys and WT and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In nerves from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, TTX-r C-CAPs could not be detected. These data indicate that Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 is the primary isoform underlying TTX-r conduction in distal axons of somatosensory C-fibers. Furthermore, there is a differential spatial distribution of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within C-fiber axons, being functionally more prominent in the most distal axons and terminal regions. The enrichment of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 in distal axons may provide a useful target in the treatment of pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether individual sodium channel isoforms exert differential roles in action potential conduction along the axonal membrane of nociceptive, unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers, but clarifying the role of sodium channel subtypes in different axonal segments may be useful for the development of novel analgesic strategies. Here, we provide evidence from mice and nonhuman primates that a substantial portion of the C-fiber compound action potential in distal peripheral nerves, but not proximal nerves or dorsal roots, is resistant to tetrodotoxin and that, in mice, this effect is mediated solely by voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8). The functional prominence of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within the axonal compartment immediately proximal to its termination may affect strategies targeting pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Choice Formation and Choice-Correlated Activity in Macaque Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Responses of individual task-relevant sensory neurons can predict monkeys' trial-by-trial choices in perceptual decision-making tasks. Choice-correlated activity has been interpreted as evidence that the responses of these neurons are causally linked to perceptual judgments. To further test this hypothesis, we studied responses of orientation-selective neurons in V1 and V2 while two macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination task. Although both animals exhibited a high level of neuronal and behavioral sensitivity, only one exhibited choice-correlated activity. Surprisingly, this correlation was negative: when a neuron fired more vigorously, the animal was less likely to choose the orientation preferred by that neuron. Moreover, choice-correlated activity emerged late in the trial, earlier in V2 than in V1, and was correlated with anticipatory signals. Together, these results suggest that choice-correlated activity in task-relevant sensory neurons can reflect postdecision modulatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When observers perform a difficult sensory discrimination, repeated presentations of the same stimulus can elicit different perceptual judgments. This behavioral variability often correlates with variability in the activity of sensory neurons driven by the stimulus. Traditionally, this correlation has been interpreted as suggesting a causal link between the activity of sensory neurons and perceptual judgments. More recently, it has been argued that the correlation instead may originate in recurrent input from other brain areas involved in the interpretation of sensory signals. Here, we call both hypotheses into question. We show that choice-related activity in sensory neurons can be highly variable across observers and can reflect modulatory processes that are dissociated from perceptual decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Uses a Real-Time Unisensory-Multisensory Transform</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the brain integrates different sensory inputs to facilitate perception and behavior has been the subject of numerous speculations. By examining multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus, the present study demonstrated that two operational principles are sufficient to understand how this remarkable result is achieved: (1) unisensory signals are integrated continuously and in real time as soon as they arrive at their common target neuron and (2) the resultant multisensory computation is modified in shape and timing by a delayed, calibrating inhibition. These principles were tested for descriptive sufficiency by embedding them in a neurocomputational model and using it to predict a neuron's moment-by-moment multisensory response given only knowledge of its responses to the individual modality-specific component cues. The predictions proved to be highly accurate, reliable, and unbiased and were, in most cases, not statistically distinguishable from the neuron's actual instantaneous multisensory response at any phase throughout its entire duration. The model was also able to explain why different multisensory products are often observed in different neurons at different time points, as well as the higher-order properties of multisensory integration, such as the dependency of multisensory products on the temporal alignment of crossmodal cues. These observations not only reveal this fundamental integrative operation, but also identify quantitatively the multisensory transform used by each neuron. As a result, they provide a means of comparing the integrative profiles among neurons and evaluating how they are affected by changes in intrinsic or extrinsic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is the process by which the brain combines information from multiple sensory sources (e.g., vision and audition) to maximize an organism's ability to identify and respond to environmental stimuli. The actual transformative process by which the neural products of multisensory integration are achieved is poorly understood. By focusing on the millisecond-by-millisecond differences between a neuron's unisensory component responses and its integrated multisensory response, it was found that this multisensory transform can be described by two basic principles: unisensory information is integrated in real time and the multisensory response is shaped by calibrating inhibition. It is now possible to use these principles to predict a neuron's multisensory response accurately armed only with knowledge of its unisensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Astrocytes are the most populous glial subtype and are critical for brain function. Despite this, historically there have been few studies into the role that they may have in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, however, several studies have determined that genes known to have a causative role in the development of PD are expressed in astrocytes and have important roles in astrocyte function. Here, we review these recent developments and discuss their impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of PD, and the implications that this might have for its treatment.</description>

	<description>Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) was originally identified as a slow Ca2+ sensor for lysosome fusion, but its function at fast synapses is controversial. The paper by Luo and Südhof (2017) in this issue of Neuron shows that at the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem Syt7 triggers asynchronous release during stimulus trains, resulting in reliable and temporally precise high-frequency transmission. Thus, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse.</description>

	<description>In contrast to the idea that tau phosphorylation is toxic, Ittner et al. (2016) recently showed that specific tau phosphorylation is neuroprotective, phenocopying tau ablation (DeVos et al., 2017), thus highlighting the complex tau biology that underlies neurotoxicity and neuroprotection.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30399-9?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Tortosa et al. show that MAP6 re-distributes from Golgi and secretory vesicles to axonal microtubules during neuronal polarization. Palmitoylation cycles control MAP6 membrane-microtubule shuttling. The authors also demonstrate the importance of MAP6 for microtubule stabilization, organelle trafficking, and axon maturation.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30396-3?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Neuroscientists need to focus communications beyond advocating for research funding. By collaborating with communication researchers, neuroscientists can more effectively inform the public discourse and policymaker decisions. This enhances the value of neuroscience and helps use science to improve social outcomes.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30363-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>In the early 1960s, few neuroscientists attempted to model brain function using mathematics. Computers were slow and expensive, so numerical approximations of complex phenomena were out of reach in most cases, and scientists resorted primarily to analytical representations of simpler processes. The study of circuits was not new to Walter J. Freeman. He had started his education studying engineering at MIT (transferring later to the University of Chicago to study English) and was a radio operator in WWII.</description>

	<description>Kim et al. found a selective role of the indirect pathway in automatic saccades to visual objects. The pathway, originating from the caudate tail, selectively sends stable value information to the superior colliculus, thus suppressing saccades to historically bad objects.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Sustained Activity Encoding Working Memories: Not Fully Distributed</title>

	<description>Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity.</description>

	<description>Brain dynamic changes associated with schizophrenia are largely equivocal, with interpretation complicated by many factors, such as the presence of therapeutic agents and the complex nature of the syndrome itself. Evidence for a brain-wide change in individual network oscillations, shared by all patients, is largely equivocal, but stronger for lower (delta) than for higher (gamma) bands. However, region-specific changes in rhythms across multiple, interdependent, nested frequencies may correlate better with pathology.</description>

	<description>Dopaminergic signalling is established as playing an important role in novelty related modulation of hippocampal memory. Two recent studies have identified the noradrenergic fibres originating in the locus coeruleus as an additional source of neurotransmitter acting on dopaminergic receptors in the hippocampus.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Christoph Anacker &amp;amp; René Hen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive processes, such as pattern separation, and in the behavioural effects of stress and antidepressants. Young adult-born neurons have been shown to inhibit the overall activity of the dentate gyrus by recruiting local interneurons, which may result in &lt;/p&gt;
