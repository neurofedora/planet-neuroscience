	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a novel approach to solve the problem of reconstructing
perceived stimuli from brain responses by combining probabilistic inference
with deep learning. Our approach first inverts the linear transformation from
latent features to brain responses with maximum a posteriori estimation and
then inverts the nonlinear transformation from perceived stimuli to latent
features with adversarial training of convolutional neural networks. We test
our approach with a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and show
that it can generate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived faces from
brain activations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collective behavior among coupled dynamical units can emerge in various forms
as a result of different coupling topologies as well as different types of
coupling functions. Chimera states have recently received ample attention as a
fascinating manifestation of collective behavior, in particular describing a
symmetry breaking spatiotemporal pattern where synchronized and desynchronized
states coexist in a network of coupled oscillators. In this perspective, we
review the emergence of different chimera states, focusing on the effects of
different coupling topologies that describe the interaction network connecting
the oscillators. We cover chimera states that emerge in local, nonlocal and
global coupling topologies, as well as in modular, temporal and multilayer
networks. We also provide an outline of challenges and directions for future
research.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Basin stability for chimera states. (arXiv:1704.05301v1 [nlin.CD] CROSS LISTED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05301</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chimera states, namely complex spatiotemporal patterns that consist of
coexisting domains of spatially coherent and incoherent dynamics, are
investigated in a network of coupled identical oscillators. These intriguing
spatiotemporal patterns were first reported in nonlocally coupled phase
oscillators, and it was shown that such mixed type behavior occurs only for
specific initial conditions in nonlocally and globally coupled networks. The
influence of initial conditions on chimera states has remained a fundamental
problem since their discovery. In this report, we investigate the robustness of
chimera states together with incoherent and coherent states in dependence on
the initial conditions. For this, we use the basin stability method which is
related to the volume of the basin of attraction, and we consider nonlocally
and globally coupled time-delayed Mackey-Glass oscillators as example.
Previously, it was shown that the existence of chimera states can be
characterized by mean phase velocity and a statistical measure, such as the
strength of incoherence, by using well prepared initial conditions. Here we
show further how the coexistence of different dynamical states can be
identified and quantified by means of the basin stability measure over a wide
range of the parameter space.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A robust dissociation among the language, multiple demand, and default mode networks: evidence from inter-region correlations in effect size</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140384v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Complex cognitive processes, including language, rely on multiple mental operations that are carried out by several large-scale functional networks in the frontal, temporal, and parietal association cortices of the human brain. The central division of cognitive labor is between two fronto-parietal bilateral networks: (a) the multiple demand (MD) network, which supports executive processes, such as working memory and cognitive control, and is engaged by diverse task domains, including language, especially when comprehension gets difficult; and (b) the default mode network (DMN), which supports introspective processes, such as mind wandering, and is active when we are not engaged in processing external stimuli. These two networks are strongly dissociated in both their functional profiles and their patterns of activity fluctuations during naturalistic cognition. Here, we focus on the functional relationship between these two networks and a third network: (c) the fronto-temporal left-lateralized &quot;core&quot; language network, which is selectively recruited by linguistic processing. Is the language network distinct and dissociated from both the MD network and the DMN, or is it synchronized and integrated with one or both of them? Recent work has provided evidence for a dissociation between the language network and the MD network. However, the relationship between the language network and the DMN is less clear, with some evidence for coordinated activity patterns and similar response profiles, perhaps due to the role of both in semantic processing. Here we use a novel fMRI approach to examine the relationship among the three networks: we measure the strength of activations in different language, MD, and DMN regions to functional contrasts typically used to identify each network, and then test which regions co-vary in their contrast effect sizes across 60 individuals. We find that effect sizes correlate strongly within each network (e.g., one language region and another language region, or one DMN region and another DMN region), but show little or no correlation for region pairs across networks (e.g., a language region and a DMN region). Thus, we replicate the language/MD network dissociation discovered previously with other methods, and also show that the language network is robustly dissociated from the DMN, overall suggesting that these three networks support distinct computations and contribute to high-level cognition in different ways. Inter-individual differences in effect sizes therefore do not simply reflect general differences in vascularization or attention, but exhibit sensitivity to the functional architecture of the brain. The strength of activation in each network can thus be probed separately in studies that attempt to link neural variability to behavioral or genetic variability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oscillatory Default Mode Network Coupling In Concussion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140368v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140368v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Concussion is a common form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Despite the descriptor &quot;mild&quot;, a single injury can leave long-lasting and sustained alterations to brain function, including changes to localised activity and large-scale interregional communication. Cognitive complaints are thought to arise from such functional deficits. We investigated the impact of injury on neurophysiological and functionally-specialised resting networks, known as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), using MEG. Methods: We assessed neurophysiological connectivity in 40 males, 20 with concussion, 20 without, using MEG. Regions-of-interest that comprise nodes of ICNs were defined, and their time courses derived using a beamformer approach. Pairwise fluctuations and covariations in band-limited amplitude envelopes were computed reflecting measures of functional connectivity. Intra-network connectivity was compared between groups using permutation testing, and correlated with symptoms. Results: We observed increased resting spectral connectivity in the default mode and motor networks in our concussion group when compared with controls, across alpha through gamma ranges. Moreover, these differences were not explained by power spectrum density (absolute changes in the spectral profiles within the ICNs). Furthermore, this increased coupling was significantly associated with symptoms in the DMN and MOT networks - but once accounting for comorbid symptoms (including, depression, anxiety, and ADHD) only the DMN continued to be associated with symptoms. Conclusion: The DMN network plays a critical role in shifting between cognitive tasks. These data suggest even a single concussion can perturb the intrinsic coupling of functionally-specialised networks in the brain and may explain persistent and wide-ranging symptomatology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Consequences Of NMDA Receptor Deficiency Can Be Rescued In The Adult Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140343v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are important in the formation of activity-dependent connections in the brain. In sensory pathways, NMDAR disruption during discrete developmental periods has enduring effects on wiring and function. Yet, it is not clear whether NMDAR-limited critical periods exist for higher-order circuits governing mood and cognition. This question is urgent for neurodevelopmental disorders, like schizophrenia, that have NMDAR hypofunction and treatment-resistant cognitive symptoms. As proof of concept, we developed a novel mouse model where developmental NMDAR deficits can be ameliorated by inducible Cre recombinase. Rescue of NMDARs in either adolescence or adulthood yields surprisingly strong improvements in higher-order behavior. Similar levels of behavioral plasticity are observed regardless of intervention age, with degree of plasticity dependent on the specific behavioral circuit. These results reveal higher-order brain function as amenable to treatment in adulthood and identify NMDAR as a key target for cognitive dysfunction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ophiuroid Phylotranscriptomics Enables Discovery Of Novel Echinoderm Representatives Of Bilaterian Neuropeptide Families And Reconstruction Of Neuropeptide Precursor Evolution Over ~270 Million Years</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129783v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129783v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Neuropeptides are a diverse class of intercellular signaling molecules that mediate neuronal regulation of many physiological and behavioural processes, including feeding, reproduction and locomotion. Recent advances in genome/transcriptome sequencing are enabling identification of neuropeptide precursor proteins in species from a growing variety of animal taxa, providing new insights into the evolution of neuropeptide signaling. Here we report a phylo-transcriptomic analysis of neuropeptide precursors in over fifty species of brittle stars (Class Ophiuroidea; Phylum Echinodermata). Results: Detailed analysis of transcriptome sequence data from three brittle star species, Ophionotus victoriae, Amphiura filiformis and Ophiopsila aranea, enabled the first comprehensive identification of neuropeptide precursors in ophiuroids. Representatives of over thirty bilaterian neuropeptide precursor families were identified, some of which occur as paralogs (e.g. thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, cholecystokinin, somatostatin and pedal peptide). Furthermore, homologs of endothelin/CCHamide, eclosion hormone, neuropeptide-F/Y and nucleobinin/nesfatin were discovered here in a deuterostome/echinoderm for the first time. The majority of ophiuroid neuropeptide precursors contain a single copy of a neuropeptide, but several precursors comprise multiple copies of identical or non-identical, but structurally-related, neuropeptides. Here we performed an unprecedented investigation of the evolution of neuropeptide copy-number over a period of ~270 million years by analysing sequence data from over fifty ophiuroid species, with reference to a robust phylogeny. Interestingly, the number of neuropeptide copies in the majority of precursors was constant across all the species examined, but examples of clade-specific losses/gains of neuropeptides were also observed. Conclusions: We report here the most comprehensive analysis to date of neuropeptide precursors in the phylum Echinodermata, with novel representatives of several bilaterian neuropeptide families discovered for the first time in echinoderms. Furthermore, analysis of precursor proteins comprising multiple copies of identical or related neuropeptides across ~270 million years of ophiuroid evolution indicates that the composition of neuropeptide cocktails is functionally important, but with plasticity over long evolutionary time scales.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a published paper \cite{Sengupta2016}, we have proposed that the brain
(and other self-organized biological and artificial systems) can be
characterized via the mathematical apparatus of a gauge theory. The picture
that emerges from this approach suggests that any biological system (from a
neuron to an organism) can be cast as resolving uncertainty about its external
milieu, either by changing its internal states or its relationship to the
environment. Using formal arguments, we have shown that a gauge theory for
neuronal dynamics -- based on approximate Bayesian inference -- has the
potential to shed new light on phenomena that have thus far eluded a formal
description, such as attention and the link between action and perception.
Here, we describe the technical apparatus that enables such a variational
inference on manifolds.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-Scale Factor Analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Signals. (arXiv:1705.06502v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06502</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we develop an approach to modeling high-dimensional networks
with a large number of nodes arranged in a hierarchical and modular structure.
We propose a novel multi-scale factor analysis (MSFA) model which partitions
the massive spatio-temporal data defined over the complex networks into a
finite set of regional clusters. To achieve further dimension reduction, we
represent the signals in each cluster by a small number of latent factors. The
correlation matrix for all nodes in the network are approximated by
lower-dimensional sub-structures derived from the cluster-specific factors. To
estimate regional connectivity between numerous nodes (within each cluster), we
apply principal components analysis (PCA) to produce factors which are derived
as the optimal reconstruction of the observed signals under the squared loss.
Then, we estimate global connectivity (between clusters or sub-networks) based
on the factors across regions using the RV-coefficient as the cross-dependence
measure. This gives a reliable and computationally efficient multi-scale
analysis of both regional and global dependencies of the large networks. The
proposed novel approach is applied to estimate brain connectivity networks
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Results on
resting-state fMRI reveal interesting modular and hierarchical organization of
human brain networks during rest.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Graph analysis and modularity of brain functional connectivity networks: searching for the optimal threshold. (arXiv:1705.06481v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging data can be represented as networks of nodes and edges that
capture the topological organization of the brain connectivity. Graph theory
provides a general and powerful framework to study these networks and their
structure at various scales. By way of example, community detection methods
have been widely applied to investigate the modular structure of many natural
networks, including brain functional connectivity networks. Sparsification
procedures are often applied to remove the weakest edges, which are the most
affected by experimental noise, and to reduce the density of the graph, thus
making it theoretically and computationally more tractable. However, weak links
may also contain significant structural information, and procedures to identify
the optimal tradeoff are the subject of active research. Here, we explore the
use of percolation analysis, a method grounded in statistical physics, to
identify the optimal sparsification threshold for community detection in brain
connectivity networks. By using synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth
modular structure and realistic topological features typical of human brain
functional connectivity networks, we show that percolation analysis can be
applied to identify the optimal sparsification threshold that maximizes
information on the networks' community structure. We validate this approach
using three different community detection methods widely applied to the
analysis of brain connectivity networks: Newman's modularity, InfoMap and
Asymptotical Surprise. Importantly, we test the effects of noise and data
variability, which are critical factors to determine the optimal threshold.
This data-driven method should prove particularly useful in the analysis of the
community structure of brain networks in populations characterized by different
connectivity strengths, such as patients and controls.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter receptor molecules, concentrated in synaptic membrane
domains along with scaffolds and other kinds of proteins, are crucial for
signal transmission across chemical synapses. In common with other membrane
protein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers
and protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules.
We study here in detail a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold
reaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to
capture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and
characteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that
our stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field
models of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of
analytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction
dynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we
find substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the
reaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion
properties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous
experiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic
reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a
simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the
molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed
single-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates
at which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Our work
sheds light on the physical mechanisms and principles linking the collective
properties of membrane protein domains to the stochastic dynamics that rule
their molecular~components.

	<description>Episodic memory, everyday memory for events, is fundamental to our lives. We tested patients undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (intracranial EEG) monitoring for the localization of medically-refractory epilepsy on a well-characterized paradigm that requires episodic memory. Here we report that an anatomically diffuse network characterized by theta-band (4-7 Hz) coherence is activated at the time of a choice that requires episodic memory. This distinct network pattern of oscillatory activity is absent in situations that do not require episodic memory. The episodic network we identified spans prefrontal and temporal lobes and coherence between these areas was greatest during memory encoding. Our data provide novel empirical evidence for a set of brain areas that supports episodic memory in humans.</description>

	<description>Parkinsons disease is a progressive age-associated neurological disorder. One of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinsons disease is the appearance of protein aggregates, mainly consisting of the protein alpha-Synuclein. These aggregates have been described both in genetic as well as idiopathic forms of the disease. Currently, Parkinsons disease patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are mainly used for in vitro disease modeling or for experimental cell replacement approaches. Here, we demonstrate that these cells can be used for in vivo disease modeling. We show that Parkinsons disease patient-specific, iPSC-derived neurons carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation show an upregulation of alpha-Synuclein after transplantation in the mouse brain. However, further investigations indicate that the increased human alpha-Synuclein levels fail to induce spreading or aggregation in the mouse brain. We therefore conclude that grafting of these cells into the mouse brain is suitable for cell autonomous in vivo disease modeling but has strong limitations beyond that. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that there might be a species barrier between human to mouse concerning alpha-Synuclein spreading.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139956v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A central model that describes how behavioral sequences are produced features a neural architecture that readies different movements simultaneously, and a mechanism where prioritized suppression between the movements determines their sequential performance. We previously described a model whereby suppression drives a Drosophila grooming sequence that is induced by simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways that each elicit a distinct movement (Seeds et al. 2014). Here, we confirm this model using transgenic expression to identify and optogenetically activate sensory neurons that elicit specific grooming movements. Simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways elicits a grooming sequence that resembles the naturally induced sequence. Moreover, the sequence proceeds after the sensory excitation is terminated, indicating that a persistent trace of this excitation induces the next grooming movement once the previous one is performed. This reveals a mechanism whereby parallel sensory inputs can be integrated and stored to elicit a delayed and sequential grooming response.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automatically tracking neurons in a moving and deforming brain</title>

Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be recorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion in these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons must be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity traces. Recordings from small invertebrates like &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; are especially challenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during animal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to reliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the brain of a freely moving &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D volumetric fluorescent images of the animal’s brain are straightened, aligned and registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via segmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new time-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector Encoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match each segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from throughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references defines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each neuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to correct errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities. The Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well suited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When applied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, this analysis pipeline located 156 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute recording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or semi-automated approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zRAXjBpewI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simultaneous inference of phylogenetic and transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks</title>

Whole-genome sequencing of pathogens from host samples becomes more and more routine during infectious disease outbreaks. These data provide information on possible transmission events which can be used for further epidemiologic analyses, such as identification of risk factors for infectivity and transmission. However, the relationship between transmission events and sequence data is obscured by uncertainty arising from four largely unobserved processes: transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics and mutation. To properly resolve transmission events, these processes need to be taken into account. Recent years have seen much progress in theory and method development, but existing applications make simplifying assumptions that often break up the dependency between the four processes, or are tailored to specific datasets with matching model assumptions and code. To obtain a method with wider applicability, we have developed a novel approach to reconstruct transmission trees with sequence data. Our approach combines elementary models for transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics, and mutation, under the assumption that the outbreak is over and all cases have been observed. We use Bayesian inference with MCMC for which we have designed novel proposal steps to efficiently traverse the posterior distribution, taking account of all unobserved processes at once. This allows for efficient sampling of transmission trees from the posterior distribution, and robust estimation of consensus transmission trees. We implemented the proposed method in a new R package &lt;i&gt;phybreak&lt;/i&gt;. The method performs well in tests of both new and published simulated data. We apply the model to five datasets on densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks, covering a wide range of epidemiological settings. Using only sampling times and sequences as data, our analyses confirmed the original results or improved on them: the more realistic infection times place more confidence in the inferred transmission trees.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UKIrSUeOxbk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism’s transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell.
The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences.
Measuring the expression of an organism’s genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism’s biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2WsdgJiNTtE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rise of the humanbot. (arXiv:1705.05935v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The accelerated path of technological development, particularly at the
interface between hardware and biology has been suggested as evidence for
future major technological breakthroughs associated to our potential to
overcome biological constraints. This includes the potential of becoming
immortal, having expanded cognitive capacities thanks to hardware implants or
the creation of intelligent machines. Here I argue that several relevant
evolutionary and structural constraints might prevent achieving most (if not
all) these innovations. Instead, the coming future will bring novelties that
will challenge many other aspects of our life and that can be seen as other
feasible singularities. One particularly important one has to do with the
evolving interactions between humans and non-intelligent robots capable of
learning and communication. Here I argue that a long term interaction can lead
to a new class of &quot;agent&quot; (the humanbot). The way shared memories get tangled
over time will inevitably have important consequences for both sides of the
pair, whose identity as separated entities might become blurred and ultimately
vanish. Understanding such hybrid systems requires a second-order neuroscience
approach while posing serious conceptual challenges, including the definition
of consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Population Density Equations for Stochastic Processes with Memory Kernels. (arXiv:1601.07126v4 [physics.bio-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07126</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07126</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel method for solving population density equations (PDEs),
where the populations can be subject to non-Markov noise for arbitrary
distributions of jump sizes. The method combines recent developments in two
different disciplines that traditionally have had limited interaction:
computational neuroscience and the theory of random networks. The method uses a
geometric binning scheme, based on the method of characteristics, to capture
the deterministic neurodynamics of the population, separating the deterministic
and stochastic process cleanly. We can independently vary the choice of the
deterministic model and the model for the stochastic process, leading to a
highly modular numerical solution strategy. We demonstrate this by replacing
the Master equation implicit in many formulations of the PDE formalism, by a
generalization called the generalized Montroll-Weiss equation - a recent result
from random network theory - describing a random walker subject to transitions
realized by a non-Markovian process. We demonstrate the method for leaky- (LIF)
and quadratic-integrate and fire (QIF) neurons subject to spike trains with
Poisson and gamma distributed spike intervals. We are able to model jump
responses for both models accurately to both excitatory and inhibitory input
under the assumption that all inputs are generated by one renewal process.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Simulating The Impact Of Sensorimotor Deficits On Reaching Performance</title>

	<description>The healthy human nervous system accurately and robustly controls movements despite nonlinear dynamics, noise, and delays. After a stroke, motor ability frequently becomes impaired. To provide insight into the relative impact of specific sensorimotor deficits on motor performance, we modeled neural control of reaching with the human upper limb as a near-optimally feedback-controlled two-degree-of-freedom system with biologically based parameters. We added three sensorimotor impairments commonly associated with post-stroke hemiparesis - abnormal joint coupling, increased noise on internally modeled dynamics, and muscular weakness - and examined the impact on reaching performance. We found that abnormal joint coupling unknown to the system's internal model caused systematic perturbations to trajectories, longer reach durations, and target overshoot. Increasing internal model noise and muscular weakness had little impact on motor performance unless model noise was increased by several orders of magnitude. Many reaches performed by our perturbed models replicate features commonly observed in reaches by hemiparetic stroke survivors. The sensitivity to unmodeled abnormal joint coupling agrees with experimental findings that abnormal coupling (possibly related to internal model errors) is the main cause of post-stroke motor impairment.</description>

	<description>The existence of abnormal connectivity patterns between resting state networks in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), has been well established. Traditional treatment methods in ASD are limited, and do not address the aberrant network structure. Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback, we directly trained 3 brain nodes in participants with ASD, in which the aberrant connectivity has been shown to correlate with symptom severity. 17 ASD participants and 10 control participants were scanned over multiple sessions (123 sessions in total). Desired network connectivity patterns were reinforced in real-time, without participants' awareness of the training taking place. This training regimen produced large, significant long-term changes in correlations at the network level, and whole brain analysis revealed that the greatest changes were focused on the areas being trained. These changes were not found in the control group. Moreover, changes in ASD resting state connectivity following the training were correlated to changes in behavior, suggesting that neurofeedback can be used to directly alter complex, clinically relevant network connectivity patterns.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Zfp423, A Joubert Syndrome Gene, Is A Domain-Specific Regulator Of Cell Cycle Progression, DNA Damage Response And Purkinje Cell Development In The Cerebellar Primordium</title>

	<description>Neurogenesis is a tightly regulated process whose success depends on the ability to balance the expansion/maintenance of an undifferentiated neural progenitor pool with the precisely timed birth of sequential generations of neurons. The Zfp423 gene encodes a 30-Zn-finger transcription factor (TF) that acts as a scaffold in the assembly of complex transcriptional and cellular machineries regulating neural development. While null mutants for Zfp423 feature a severe cerebellar hypoplasia, the underlying mechanism is only partially characterized. Mutations of the human ortholog ZNF423 have been identified in patients carrying cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (CVH) or Joubert Syndrome (JS), associated with other signs of classical ciliopathy outside the central nervous system (CNS). ZNF423 also plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR). To further characterize the role of ZFP423 in cerebellar neurogenesis, with a focus on Purkinje cells (PC) development, we analyzed two previously undescribed mutant mouse lines carrying allelic in-frame deletions of the corresponding gene, selectively affecting two functionally characterized protein-protein interaction domains, affecting zinc (Zn) fingers 9-20 or 28-30. Some phenotypic defects are allele specific: Zfp423{Delta}9-20/{Delta}9-20 mutants exhibit a depletion of the OLIG2+ PC progenitor pool in the cerebellar ventricular zone (VZ). In these mutants, M-phase progenitors display changes in spindle orientation indicative of a precocious switch from symmetric to asymmetric cell division. Conversely, the Zfp423{Delta}28-30/{Delta}28-30 primordium displays a sharp decrease in the expression of PC differentiation markers, including CORL2, despite an abundance of cycling PC progenitors. Moreover, and importantly, in both mutants VZ progenitor cell cycle progression is remarkably affected, and factors involved in the DDR are substantially upregulated in the VZ and in postmitotic precursors alike. Our in vivo evidence sheds light on the domain-specific roles played by ZFP423 in different aspects of PC progenitor development, and at the same time supports the emerging notion that an impaired DNA damage response may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of JS and other ciliopathies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Quantitative MRI Provides Markers Of Intra-, Inter-Regional, And Age-Related Differences In Young Adult Cortical Microstructure</title>

	<description>Measuring the structural composition of the cortex is critical to understanding typical development, yet few investigations in humans have charted markers in vivo that are sensitive to tissue microstructural attributes. Here, we used a well-validated quantitative MR protocol to measure four parameters (R1, MT, R2*, PD*) that differ in their sensitivity to facets of the tissue microstructural environment (R1, MT: myelin, macromolecular content; R2*: paramagnetic ions, i.e., iron; PD*: free water content). Mapping these parameters across cortical regions in a young adult cohort (18-30 years, N=93) revealed expected patterns of increased macromolecular content as well as reduced tissue water content in primary and primary adjacent cortical regions. Mapping across cortical depth within regions showed decreased expression of myelin and related processes - but increased tissue water content - when progressing from the grey/white to the grey/pial boundary, in all regions. Charting developmental change in cortical microstructure, we found that parameters with the greatest sensitivity to tissue myelin (R1 &amp;amp; MT) showed linear increases with age across frontal and parietal cortex (change 0.5-1.0% per year). Overlap of robust age effects for both parameters emerged in left inferior frontal, right parietal and bilateral pre-central regions. Our findings afford an improved understanding of ontogeny in early adulthood and offer normative quantitative MR data for inter- and intra-cortical composition, which may be used as benchmarks in further studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Core Speech Circuit Between Primary Motor, Somatosensory, And Auditory Cortex: Evidence From Connectivity And Genetic Descriptions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139550v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139550v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>What adaptations allow humans to produce and perceive speech so effortlessly? We show that speech is supported by a largely undocumented core of structural and functional connectivity between the central sulcus (CS or primary motor and somatosensory cortex) and the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG or primary auditory cortex). Anatomically, we show that CS and TTG cortical thickness covary across individuals and that they are connected by white matter tracts. Neuroimaging network analyses confirm the functional relevance and specificity of these structural relationships. Specifically, the CS and TTG are functionally connected at rest, during natural audiovisual speech perception, and are coactive over a large variety of linguistic stimuli and tasks. Importantly, across structural and functional analyses, connectivity of regions immediately adjacent to the TTG are with premotor and prefrontal regions rather than the CS. Finally, we show that this structural/functional CS-TTG relationship is mediated by a constellation of genes associated with vocal learning and disorders of efference copy. We propose that this core circuit constitutes an interface for rapidly exchanging articulatory and acoustic information and discuss implications for current models of speech.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Infants Are Superior In Implicit Crossmodal Learning And Use Other Learning Mechanisms Than Adults</title>

	<description>While adults have to continuously adapt their internal representations of the sensory world, infants need to first acquire these models. We used event-related potentials to test the hypothesis that infants extract crossmodal statistics implicitly while adults learn them when task relevant. Six-month-old infants and adults were passively exposed to frequent standard audio-visual combinations (A1V1, A2V2, p=0.35 each), rare recombinations of the standard stimuli (A1V2, A2V1, p=0.10 each), and a rare deviant audio-visual combination with an infrequent auditory and visual element (A3V3, p=0.10). While both infants and adults differentiated between rare deviants and standards at early processing stages, only infants discriminated standards from recombined stimuli at a later processing stage. A second experiment revealed that adults discriminated recombined from standard combinations only when crossmodal combinations were task relevant. These results demonstrate a heightened sensitivity for crossmodal statistics in infants and a change in learning mode from infancy to adulthood.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Individual Differences In Perceptual Decision Making Reflect Neural Variability In Medial Frontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139493v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139493v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Decision making obeys common neural mechanisms, but there is considerable variability in individuals' decision making behavior particularly under uncertainty. How individual differences arise within common decision making brain systems is not known. Here, we explored this question in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) of rats performing a sensory-guided choice task. When rats trained on familiar stimuli were exposed to unfamiliar stimuli, choice responses varied significantly across individuals. We examined how variability in MFC neural processing could mediate this individual difference and constructed a network model to replicate this. Our model suggested that susceptibility of neural trajectories is a crucial determinant of the observed choice variability. The model predicted that trial-by-trial variability of trajectories are correlated with the susceptibility, and hence also correlated with the individual difference. This prediction was confirmed by experiment. Thus, our results suggest that variability in neural dynamics in MFC networks underlies individual differences in decision making.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Parallel Occurrence Of Theta And Respiration-Coupled Network Oscillations Throughout The Mouse Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139485v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Slow brain oscillations are usually coherent over long distances and are thought to constitute a means to link distributed cell assemblies. In mice, theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) stand as one of the most studied global slow rhythms. Previous research has suggested that theta takes part in interregional communication required for cognitive functions. However, mice often breathe at theta frequency, and we have recently reported that nasal respiration leads to synchronous network oscillations that are independent of theta. Namely, we showed that respiration-coupled oscillations occur in the hippocampus, prelimbic cortex, and parietal cortex, suggesting that, as theta, respiration-coupled oscillations are also global. In the present work, we sought to extend these findings by tracking respiration while simultaneously recording local field potentials from 15 brain regions of freely moving mice during exploration and REM sleep. We report that respiration-coupled rhythms can be detected in parallel with theta in widespread neocortical regions, from prefrontal to visual areas, and also in subcortical structures such as the thalamus, amygdala and ventral hippocampus. Though both rhythms occur simultaneously, respiration-coupled oscillations are more dominant in frontal regions while theta oscillations prevail in more caudal networks. We conclude that respiration-coupled oscillations are a global brain rhythm suited to entrain distributed networks into a common regime. This pattern might have escaped attention in previous studies due to the absence of respiration monitoring, its similarity with theta oscillations, and its highly variable peak frequency. It should, however, be considered as a widespread signal and potential mechanism of long-range network communication.</description>

	<description>A high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEA) with 3,150 electrodes per square millimetre was used to capture neuronal activity across various scales, including axons, dendrites, and networks. We present a new method for high-throughput segmentation of axons based on the spatial smoothness of signal delays. Comparison with both ground truth and receiver operator characteristics shows that the new segmentation method outperforms previous methods based on the signal-amplitude-to-noise ratio. Structural and functional neuronal network connectivity were reconstructed using a common extension of &quot;Peter's rule&quot; and a inter-spike histogram method, respectively. Approximately one third of these connections are putative chemical synapses. We evaluated the spike patterns but did not find evidence for &quot;polychronisation&quot; (non-synchronous but precisely timed spike sequences). The developed framework can be used to investigate the relationship between the topology of neuronal connections and emerging temporal spike patterns observed in dissociated neuronal cultures.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Switch Independent Task Representations In Frontal And Parietal Cortex</title>

	<description>Alternating between two tasks is effortful and impairs performance. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found increased activity in fronto-parietal cortex when task switching is required. One possibility is that the additional control demands for switch trials are met by strengthening task representations in the human brain. Alternatively, on switch trials the residual representation of the previous task might impede the buildup of a neural task representation. This would predict weaker task representations on switch trials, thus also explaining the performance costs. To test this, participants were cued to perform one of two similar tasks, with the task being repeated or switched between successive trials. MVPA was used to test which regions encode the tasks and whether this encoding differs between switch and repeat trials. As expected, we found information about task representations in frontal and parietal cortex, but there was no difference in the decoding accuracy of task-related information between switch and repeat trials. Using cross-classification we found that the fronto-parietal cortex encodes tasks using a similar spatial pattern in switch and repeat trials. Thus, task representations in frontal and parietal cortex are largely switch-independent. We found no evidence that neural information about task representations in these regions can explain behavioral costs usually associated with task switching.</description>

Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAM’s enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DmSJoTlfGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sodium Channel Nav1.8 Underlies TTX-Resistant Axonal Action Potential Conduction in Somatosensory C-Fibers of Distal Cutaneous Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5204?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are responsible for the initiation and conduction of action potentials within primary afferents. The nine Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms recognized in mammals are often functionally divided into tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (TTX-s) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) that are blocked by nanomolar concentrations and TTX-resistant (TTX-r) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9) inhibited by millimolar concentrations, with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5 having an intermediate toxin sensitivity. For small-diameter primary afferent neurons, it is unclear to what extent different Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms are distributed along the peripheral and central branches of their bifurcated axons. To determine the relative contribution of TTX-s and TTX-r channels to action potential conduction in different axonal compartments, we investigated the effects of TTX on C-fiber-mediated compound action potentials (C-CAPs) of proximal and distal peripheral nerve segments and dorsal roots from mice and pigtail monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;). In the dorsal roots and proximal peripheral nerves of mice and nonhuman primates, TTX reduced the C-CAP amplitude to 16% of the baseline. In contrast, &amp;gt;30% of the C-CAP was resistant to TTX in distal peripheral branches of monkeys and WT and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In nerves from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, TTX-r C-CAPs could not be detected. These data indicate that Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 is the primary isoform underlying TTX-r conduction in distal axons of somatosensory C-fibers. Furthermore, there is a differential spatial distribution of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within C-fiber axons, being functionally more prominent in the most distal axons and terminal regions. The enrichment of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 in distal axons may provide a useful target in the treatment of pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether individual sodium channel isoforms exert differential roles in action potential conduction along the axonal membrane of nociceptive, unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers, but clarifying the role of sodium channel subtypes in different axonal segments may be useful for the development of novel analgesic strategies. Here, we provide evidence from mice and nonhuman primates that a substantial portion of the C-fiber compound action potential in distal peripheral nerves, but not proximal nerves or dorsal roots, is resistant to tetrodotoxin and that, in mice, this effect is mediated solely by voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8). The functional prominence of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within the axonal compartment immediately proximal to its termination may affect strategies targeting pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Choice Formation and Choice-Correlated Activity in Macaque Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Responses of individual task-relevant sensory neurons can predict monkeys' trial-by-trial choices in perceptual decision-making tasks. Choice-correlated activity has been interpreted as evidence that the responses of these neurons are causally linked to perceptual judgments. To further test this hypothesis, we studied responses of orientation-selective neurons in V1 and V2 while two macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination task. Although both animals exhibited a high level of neuronal and behavioral sensitivity, only one exhibited choice-correlated activity. Surprisingly, this correlation was negative: when a neuron fired more vigorously, the animal was less likely to choose the orientation preferred by that neuron. Moreover, choice-correlated activity emerged late in the trial, earlier in V2 than in V1, and was correlated with anticipatory signals. Together, these results suggest that choice-correlated activity in task-relevant sensory neurons can reflect postdecision modulatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When observers perform a difficult sensory discrimination, repeated presentations of the same stimulus can elicit different perceptual judgments. This behavioral variability often correlates with variability in the activity of sensory neurons driven by the stimulus. Traditionally, this correlation has been interpreted as suggesting a causal link between the activity of sensory neurons and perceptual judgments. More recently, it has been argued that the correlation instead may originate in recurrent input from other brain areas involved in the interpretation of sensory signals. Here, we call both hypotheses into question. We show that choice-related activity in sensory neurons can be highly variable across observers and can reflect modulatory processes that are dissociated from perceptual decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Uses a Real-Time Unisensory-Multisensory Transform</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the brain integrates different sensory inputs to facilitate perception and behavior has been the subject of numerous speculations. By examining multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus, the present study demonstrated that two operational principles are sufficient to understand how this remarkable result is achieved: (1) unisensory signals are integrated continuously and in real time as soon as they arrive at their common target neuron and (2) the resultant multisensory computation is modified in shape and timing by a delayed, calibrating inhibition. These principles were tested for descriptive sufficiency by embedding them in a neurocomputational model and using it to predict a neuron's moment-by-moment multisensory response given only knowledge of its responses to the individual modality-specific component cues. The predictions proved to be highly accurate, reliable, and unbiased and were, in most cases, not statistically distinguishable from the neuron's actual instantaneous multisensory response at any phase throughout its entire duration. The model was also able to explain why different multisensory products are often observed in different neurons at different time points, as well as the higher-order properties of multisensory integration, such as the dependency of multisensory products on the temporal alignment of crossmodal cues. These observations not only reveal this fundamental integrative operation, but also identify quantitatively the multisensory transform used by each neuron. As a result, they provide a means of comparing the integrative profiles among neurons and evaluating how they are affected by changes in intrinsic or extrinsic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is the process by which the brain combines information from multiple sensory sources (e.g., vision and audition) to maximize an organism's ability to identify and respond to environmental stimuli. The actual transformative process by which the neural products of multisensory integration are achieved is poorly understood. By focusing on the millisecond-by-millisecond differences between a neuron's unisensory component responses and its integrated multisensory response, it was found that this multisensory transform can be described by two basic principles: unisensory information is integrated in real time and the multisensory response is shaped by calibrating inhibition. It is now possible to use these principles to predict a neuron's multisensory response accurately armed only with knowledge of its unisensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Reversals in Neural Recruitment across Memory Retrieval Phases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several decades, neuroimaging research has identified age-related neural changes that occur during cognitive tasks. These changes are used to help researchers identify functional changes that contribute to age-related impairments in cognitive performance. One commonly reported example of such a change is an age-related decrease in the recruitment of posterior sensory regions coupled with an increased recruitment of prefrontal regions across multiple cognitive tasks. This shift is often described as a compensatory recruitment of prefrontal regions due to age-related sensory-processing deficits in posterior regions. However, age is not only associated with spatial shifts in recruitment, but also with temporal shifts, in which younger and older adults recruit the same neural region at different points in a task trial. The current study examines the possible contribution of temporal modifications in the often-reported posterior–anterior shift. Participants, ages 19–85, took part in a memory retrieval task with a protracted retrieval trial consisting of an initial memory search phase and a subsequent detail elaboration phase. Age-related neural patterns during search replicated prior reports of age-related decreases in posterior recruitment and increases in prefrontal recruitment. However, during the later elaboration phase, the same posterior regions were associated with age-related increases in activation. Further, ROI and functional connectivity results suggest that these posterior regions function similarly during search and elaboration. These results suggest that the often-reported posterior–anterior shift may not reflect the inability of older adults to engage in sensory processing, but rather a change in when they recruit this processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current study provides evidence that the often-reported posterior–anterior shift in aging may not reflect a global sensory-processing deficit, as has often been reported, but rather a temporal modification in this processing in which older adults engage the same neural regions during a detail elaboration phase that younger adults engage during memory search. In other words, older adults may ultimately be able to engage the same processes as younger adults during some cognitive tasks when given the time to do so. Future research should examine the generalizability of this effect and the importance of encouraging older adults to engage in these processes through task instruction or questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Peripheral Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-{alpha}) Modulates Amyloid Pathology by Regulating Blood-Derived Immune Cells and Glial Response in the Brain of AD/TNF Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence has suggested that systemic inflammation along with local brain inflammation can play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules that regulate the crosstalk between the immune and the CNS can provide potential therapeutic targets. TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD. Recent studies have reported that anti-TNF-α therapy or RA itself can modulate AD pathology, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. To investigate the role of peripheral TNF-α as a mediator of RA in the pathogenesis of AD, we generated double-transgenic 5XFAD/Tg197 AD/TNF mice that develop amyloid deposits and inflammatory arthritis induced by human TNF-α (huTNF-α) expression. We found that 5XFAD/Tg197 mice display decreased amyloid deposition, compromised neuronal integrity, and robust brain inflammation characterized by extensive gliosis and elevated blood-derived immune cell populations, including phagocytic macrophages and microglia. To evaluate the contribution of peripheral huTNF-α in the observed brain phenotype, we treated 5XFAD/Tg197 mice systemically with infliximab, an anti-huTNF-α antibody that does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier and prevents arthritis. Peripheral inhibition of huTNF-α increases amyloid deposition, rescues neuronal impairment, and suppresses gliosis and recruitment of blood-derived immune cells, without affecting brain huTNF-α levels. Our data report, for the first time, a distinctive role for peripheral TNF-α in the modulation of the amyloid phenotype in mice by regulating blood-derived and local brain inflammatory cell populations involved in β-amyloid clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence supports the active involvement of systemic inflammation, in addition to local brain inflammation, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. TNF-α is a pluripotent cytokine that has been independently involved in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD. Here we first demonstrate that manipulation of peripheral TNF-α in the context of arthritis modulates the amyloid phenotype by regulating immune cell trafficking in the mouse brain. Our study suggests that additionally to its local actions in the AD brain, TNF-α can also indirectly modulate amyloid pathology as a regulator of peripheral inflammation. Our findings may have significant implications in the treatment of RA patients with anti-TNF-α drugs and in the potential use of TNF-targeted therapies for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Severity of Vestibular Dysfunction in Deafness as a Determinant of Comorbid Hyperactivity or Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5144?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety-related disorders occur at rates 2–3 times higher in deaf compared with hearing children. Potential explanations for these elevated rates and the heterogeneity of behavioral disorders associated with deafness have usually focused on socio-environmental rather than biological effects. Children with the 22q11.2 deletion or duplication syndromes often display hearing loss and behavioral disorders, including ADHD and anxiety-related disorders. Here, we show that mouse mutants with either a gain or loss of function of the T-Box transcription factor gene, &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt;, which lies within the 22q11.2 region and is responsible for most of the syndromic defects, exhibit inner ear defects and hyperactivity. Furthermore, we show that (1) inner ear dysfunction due to the tissue-specific loss of &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Slc12a2&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter and is also necessary for inner ear function, causes hyperactivity; (2) vestibular rather than auditory failure causes hyperactivity; and (3) the severity rather than the age of onset of vestibular dysfunction differentiates whether hyperactivity or anxiety co-occurs with inner ear dysfunction. Together, these findings highlight a biological link between inner ear dysfunction and behavioral disorders and how sensory abnormalities can contribute to the etiology of disorders traditionally considered of cerebral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study examines the biological rather than socio-environmental reasons why hyperactivity and anxiety disorders occur at higher rates in deaf individuals. Using conditional genetic approaches in mice, the authors show that (1) inner ear dysfunction due to either &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Slc12a2&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause hyperactivity; (2) it is vestibular dysfunction, which frequently co-occurs with deafness but often remains undiagnosed, rather than auditory dysfunction that causes hyperactivity and anxiety-related symptoms; and (3) the severity of vestibular dysfunction can predict whether hyperactivity or anxiety coexist with inner ear dysfunction. These findings suggest a need to evaluate vestibular function in hearing impaired individuals, especially those who exhibit hyperactive and anxiety-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Focal Local Field Potential Signature of the Single-Axon Monosynaptic Thalamocortical Connection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5123?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A resurgence has taken place in recent years in the use of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) to investigate neural network activity. To probe monosynaptic thalamic activation of cortical postsynaptic target cells, so called spike-trigger-averaged LFP (stLFP) signatures have been measured. In these experiments, the cortical LFP is measured by multielectrodes covering several cortical lamina and averaged on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical (TC) cells. Using a well established forward-modeling scheme, we investigated the biophysical origin of this stLFP signature with simultaneous synaptic activation of cortical layer-4 neurons, mimicking the effect of a single afferent spike from a single TC neuron. Constrained by previously measured intracellular responses of the main postsynaptic target cell types and with biologically plausible assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of thalamic synaptic inputs into layer 4, the model predicted characteristic contributions to monosynaptic stLFP signatures both for the regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and the fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. In particular, the FS cells generated stLFP signatures of shorter temporal duration than the RS cells. Added together, a sum of the stLFP signatures of these two principal synaptic targets of TC cells were observed to resemble experimentally measured stLFP signatures. Outside the volume targeted by TC afferents, the resulting postsynaptic LFP signals were found to be sharply attenuated. This implies that such stLFP signatures provide a very local measure of TC synaptic activation, and that newly developed inverse current-source density (CSD)-estimation methods are needed for precise assessment of the underlying spatiotemporal CSD profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite its long history and prevalent use, the proper interpretation of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) is still not fully established. Here we investigate by biophysical modeling the origin of the focal LFP signature of the single-axon monosynaptic thalamocortical connection as measured by spike-trigger-averaging of cortical LFPs on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical neurons. We find that this LFP signature is well accounted for by a model assuming thalamic projections to two cortical layer-4 cell populations: one excitatory (putatively regular-spiking cells) and one inhibitory (putatively fast-spiking cells). The LFP signature is observed to decay sharply outside the cortical region receiving the thalamocortical projection, implying that it indeed provides a very local measure of thalamocortical synaptic activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mediation of Movement-Induced Breakthrough Cancer Pain by IB4-Binding Nociceptors in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5111?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5111?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cancer-induced bone pain is characterized by moderate to severe ongoing pain that commonly requires the use of opiates. Even when ongoing pain is well controlled, patients can suffer breakthrough pain (BTP), episodic severe pain that &quot;breaks through&quot; the medication. We developed a novel model of cancer-induced BTP using female rats with mammary adenocarcinoma cells sealed within the tibia. We demonstrated previously that rats with bone cancer learn to prefer a context paired with saphenous nerve block to elicit pain relief (i.e., conditioned place preference, CPP), revealing the presence of ongoing pain. Treatment with systemic morphine abolished CPP to saphenous nerve block, demonstrating control of ongoing pain. Here, we show that pairing BTP induced by experimenter-induced movement of the tumor-bearing hindlimb with a context produces conditioned place avoidance (CPA) in rats treated with morphine to control ongoing pain, consistent with clinical observation of BTP. Preventing movement-induced afferent input by saphenous nerve block before, but not after, hindlimb movement blocked movement-induced BTP. Ablation of isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, sensory afferents eliminated movement-induced BTP, suggesting that input from IB4-binding fibers mediates BTP. Identification of potential molecular targets specific to this population of fibers may allow for the development of peripherally restricted analgesics that control BTP and improve quality of life in patients with skeletal metastases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We present a novel preclinical measure of movement-induced breakthrough pain (BTP) that is observed in the presence of morphine controlling ongoing pain. Blockade of sensory input before movement prevented BTP, whereas nerve block after movement failed to reverse BTP. These observations indicate that blocking peripheral sensory input may prevent BTP and targeting central sites may be required for pain relief once BTP has been initiated. Preventing sensory input from TRPV1-expressing fibers failed to alter movement-induced BTP. In contrast, preventing sensory input from isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding fibers blocked movement-induced BTP. Therefore, examining molecular targets on this population of nociceptive fibers may prove useful for developing an improved strategy for preventing BTP in cancer patients with skeletal metastases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inhibition of Drp1 Ameliorates Synaptic Depression, A{beta} Deposition, and Cognitive Impairment in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive mitochondrial fission is a prominent early event and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic failure, and neuronal cell death in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission is beneficial in mammal models of AD. To determine whether dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fragmentation, can be a disease-modifying therapeutic target for AD, we examined the effects of Drp1 inhibitor on mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions induced by oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) in neurons and neuropathology and cognitive functions in Aβ precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic AD mice. Inhibition of Drp1 alleviates mitochondrial fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, ATP reduction, and synaptic depression in Aβ-treated neurons. Furthermore, Drp1 inhibition significantly improves learning and memory and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ deposition in the brain in the AD model. These results provide evidence that Drp1 plays an important role in Aβ-mediated and AD-related neuropathology and in cognitive decline in an AD animal model. Therefore, inhibiting excessive Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission may be an efficient therapeutic avenue for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondrial fission relies on the evolutionary conserved dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 activity and mitochondria fragmentation are significantly elevated in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the inhibition of Drp1 restored amyloid-β (Aβ)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunctions and synaptic depression in neurons and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ deposition in the brain of AD mice. As a result, memory deficits in AD mice were rescued by Drp1 inhibition. These results suggest that neuropathology and combined cognitive decline can be attributed to hyperactivation of Drp1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, inhibitors of excessive mitochondrial fission, such as Drp1 inhibitors, may be a new strategy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visually Evoked 3-5 Hz Membrane Potential Oscillations Reduce the Responsiveness of Visual Cortex Neurons in Awake Behaving Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5084?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low-frequency membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) oscillations were once thought to only occur in sleeping and anesthetized states. Recently, low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations have been described in inactive awake animals, but it is unclear whether they shape sensory processing in neurons and whether they occur during active awake behavioral states. To answer these questions, we performed two-photon guided whole-cell &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; recordings from primary visual cortex layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and performance of visual and auditory discrimination tasks. We recorded stereotyped 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations where the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; baseline hyperpolarized as the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; underwent high amplitude rhythmic fluctuations lasting 1–2 s in duration. When 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations coincided with visual cues, excitatory neuron responses to preferred cues were significantly reduced. Despite this disruption to sensory processing, visual cues were critical for evoking 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations when animals performed discrimination tasks and passively viewed drifting grating stimuli. Using pupillometry and animal locomotive speed as indicators of arousal, we found that 3–5 Hz oscillations were not restricted to unaroused states and that they occurred equally in aroused and unaroused states. Therefore, low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations play a role in shaping sensory processing in visual cortical neurons, even during active wakefulness and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A neuron's membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) strongly shapes how information is processed in sensory cortices of awake animals. Yet, very little is known about how low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations influence sensory processing and whether they occur in aroused awake animals. By performing two-photon guided whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex of awake behaving animals, we found visually evoked stereotyped 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations that disrupt excitatory responsiveness to visual stimuli. Moreover, these oscillations occurred when animals were in high and low arousal states as measured by animal speed and pupillometry. These findings show, for the first time, that low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations can significantly modulate sensory signal processing, even in awake active animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Dissonance (Revised): An EEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5074?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5074?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that our preferences are modulated by the mere act of choosing. A choice between two similarly valued alternatives creates psychological tension (cognitive dissonance) that is reduced by a postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives. We measured EEG of human subjects during rest and free-choice paradigm. Our study demonstrates that choices associated with stronger cognitive dissonance trigger a larger negative frontocentral evoked response similar to error-related negativity, which has in turn been implicated in general performance monitoring. Furthermore, the amplitude of the evoked response is correlated with the reevaluation of the alternatives. We also found a link between individual neural dynamics (long-range temporal correlations) of the frontocentral cortices during rest and follow-up neural and behavioral effects of cognitive dissonance. Individuals with stronger resting-state long-range temporal correlations demonstrated a greater postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives and larger evoked brain responses associated with stronger cognitive dissonance. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive dissonance is reflected in both resting-state and choice-related activity of the prefrontal cortex as part of the general performance-monitoring circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Contrary to traditional decision theory, behavioral studies repeatedly demonstrate that our preferences are modulated by the mere act of choosing. Difficult choices generate psychological (cognitive) dissonance, which is reduced by the postdecisional devaluation of unchosen options. We found that decisions associated with a higher level of cognitive dissonance elicited a stronger negative frontocentral deflection that peaked ~60 ms after the response. This activity shares similar spatial and temporal features as error-related negativity, the electrophysiological correlate of performance monitoring. Furthermore, the frontocentral resting-state activity predicted the individual magnitude of preference change and the strength of cognitive dissonance-related neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Effects and Sex Differences in Gray Matter Density, Volume, Mass, and Cortical Thickness from Childhood to Young Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5065?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental structural neuroimaging studies in humans have long described decreases in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT) during adolescence. Gray matter density (GMD), a measure often assumed to be highly related to volume, has not been systematically investigated in development. We used T1 imaging data collected on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort to study age-related effects and sex differences in four regional gray matter measures in 1189 youths ranging in age from 8 to 23 years. Custom T1 segmentation and a novel high-resolution gray matter parcellation were used to extract GMD, GMV, gray matter mass (GMM; defined as GMD &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; GMV), and CT from 1625 brain regions. Nonlinear models revealed that each modality exhibits unique age-related effects and sex differences. While GMV and CT generally decrease with age, GMD increases and shows the strongest age-related effects, while GMM shows a slight decline overall. Females have lower GMV but higher GMD than males throughout the brain. Our findings suggest that GMD is a prime phenotype for the assessment of brain development and likely cognition and that periadolescent gray matter loss may be less pronounced than previously thought. This work highlights the need for combined quantitative histological MRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates that different MRI-derived gray matter measures show distinct age and sex effects and should not be considered equivalent but complementary. It is shown for the first time that gray matter density increases from childhood to young adulthood, in contrast with gray matter volume and cortical thickness, and that females, who are known to have lower gray matter volume than males, have higher density throughout the brain. A custom preprocessing pipeline and a novel high-resolution parcellation were created to analyze brain scans of 1189 youths collected as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. A clear understanding of normal structural brain development is essential for the examination of brain–behavior relationships, the study of brain disease, and, ultimately, clinical applications of neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Orbitofrontal and Anterior Cingulate Pathways to the Amygdala Target Inhibitory and Excitatory Systems with Opposite Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5051?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5051?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bidirectional dialogue of the primate posterior orbitofrontal cortex (pOFC) with the amygdala is essential in cognitive–emotional functions. The pOFC also sends a uniquely one-way excitatory pathway to the amygdalar inhibitory intercalated masses (IM), which inhibit the medial part of the central amygdalar nucleus (CeM). Inhibition of IM has the opposite effect, allowing amygdalar activation of autonomic structures and emotional arousal. Using multiple labeling approaches to identify pathways and their postsynaptic sites in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys, we found that the anterior cingulate cortex innervated mostly the basolateral and CeM amygdalar nuclei, poised to activate CeM for autonomic arousal. By contrast, a pathway from pOFC to IM exceeded all other pathways to the amygdala by density and size and proportion of large and efficient terminals. Moreover, whereas pOFC terminals in IM innervated each of the three distinct classes of inhibitory neurons, most targeted neurons expressing dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+), known to be modulated by dopamine. The predominant pOFC innervation of DARPP-32+ neurons suggests activation of IM and inhibition of CeM, resulting in modulated autonomic function. By contrast, inhibition of DARPP-32 neurons in IM by high dopamine levels disinhibits CeM and triggers autonomic arousal. The findings provide a mechanism to help explain how a strong pOFC pathway, which is poised to moderate activity of CeM, through IM, can be undermined by the high level of dopamine during stress, resulting in collapse of potent inhibitory mechanisms in the amygdala and heightened autonomic drive, as seen in chronic anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dialogue between prefrontal cortex and amygdala allows thoughts and emotions to influence actions. The posterior orbitofrontal cortex sends a powerful pathway that targets a special class of amygdalar intercalated mass (IM) inhibitory neurons, whose wiring may help modulate autonomic function. By contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex innervates other amygdalar parts, activating circuits to help avoid danger. Most IM neurons in primates label for the protein DARPP-32, known to be activated or inhibited based on the level of dopamine. Stress markedly increases dopamine release and inhibits IM neurons, compromises prefrontal control of the amygdala, and sets off a general alarm system as seen in affective disorders, such as chronic anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum neurofilament light: A biomarker of neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis</title>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24954</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;: Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are unique to neuronal cells, are shed to the CSF and are detectable at low concentrations in peripheral blood. Various diseases causing neuronal damage have resulted in elevated CSF concentrations. We explored the value of an ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) serum NfL (sNfL) assay in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were measured in healthy controls (HC, n=254) and two independent MS cohorts: (1) cross-sectional with paired serum and CSF samples (n=142); (2) longitudinal with repeated serum sampling (n=246, median (IQR) follow-up 3.1 (2.0-4.0) years). We assessed their relation to concurrent clinical, imaging and treatment parameters and to future clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were higher in both MS cohorts than in HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). We found a strong association between CSF NfL and sNfL (β=0.589, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Patients with either brain or spinal (43.4 (25.2-65.3) pg/ml) or both brain and spinal gadolinium enhancing lesions (62.5 (42.7-71.4) pg/ml) had higher sNfL than those without (29.6 (20.9-41.8) pg/ml; β=1.461, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.005 and β=1.902, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.002 respectively). sNfL was independently associated with EDSS assessments (β=1.105, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and presence of relapses (β=1.430, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). sNfL levels were lower under disease modifying treatment (β=0.818, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.003). Patients with sNfL levels above the 80&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; HC based percentiles had higher risk of relapses (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: IRR=1.94, 95%CI=1.21-3.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.006) and EDSS worsening (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: OR=2.41, 95%CI=1.07-5.42, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.034).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;: These results support the value of sNfL as a sensitive and clinically meaningful blood biomarker to monitor tissue damage and the effects of therapies in MS.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimized brute-force algorithms for the bifurcation analysis of a spin-glass-like neural network model. (arXiv:1705.05647v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05647</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05647</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bifurcation theory is a powerful tool for studying how the dynamics of a
neural network model depends on its underlying neurophysiological parameters.
However, bifurcation theory has been developed mostly for smooth dynamical
systems and for continuous-time non-smooth models, which prevents us from
understanding the changes of dynamics in some widely used classes of artificial
neural network models. This article is an attempt to fill this gap, through the
introduction of algorithms that perform a semi-analytical bifurcation analysis
of a spin-glass-like neural network model with binary firing rates and
discrete-time evolution. Our approach is based on a numerical brute-force
search of the stationary and oscillatory solutions of the spin-glass model,
from which we derive analytical expressions of its bifurcation structure by
means of the state-to-state transition probability matrix. The algorithms
determine how the network parameters affect the degree of multistability, the
emergence and the period of the neural oscillations, and the formation of
symmetry-breaking in the neural populations. While this technique can be
applied to networks with arbitrary (generally asymmetric) connectivity
matrices, in particular we introduce a highly efficient algorithm for the
bifurcation analysis of sparse networks. We also provide some examples of the
obtained bifurcation diagrams and a Python implementation of the algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: GP CaKe: Effective brain connectivity with causal kernels. (arXiv:1705.05603v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05603</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05603</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental goal in network neuroscience is to understand how activity in
one region drives activity elsewhere, a process referred to as effective
connectivity. Here we propose to model this causal interaction using
integro-differential equations and causal kernels that allow for a rich
analysis of effective connectivity. The approach combines the tractability and
flexibility of autoregressive modeling with the biophysical interpretability of
dynamic causal modeling. The causal kernels are learned nonparametrically using
Gaussian process regression, yielding an efficient framework for causal
inference. We construct a novel class of causal covariance functions that
enforce the desired properties of the causal kernels, an approach which we call
GP CaKe. By construction, the model and its hyperparameters have biophysical
meaning and are therefore easily interpretable. We demonstrate the efficacy of
GP CaKe on a number of simulations and give an example of a realistic
application on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sparse Coding by Spiking Neural Networks: Convergence Theory and Computational Results. (arXiv:1705.05475v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05475</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05475</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a spiking neural network (SNN), individual neurons operate autonomously
and only communicate with other neurons sparingly and asynchronously via spike
signals. These characteristics render a massively parallel hardware
implementation of SNN a potentially powerful computer, albeit a non von Neumann
one. But can one guarantee that a SNN computer solves some important problems
reliably? In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model of one SNN that can
be configured for a sparse coding problem for feature extraction. With a
moderate but well-defined assumption, we prove that the SNN indeed solves
sparse coding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous result
of this kind.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Learning Mid-Level Auditory Codes from Natural Sound Statistics. (arXiv:1701.07138v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07138</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07138</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interaction with the world requires an organism to transform sensory signals
into representations in which behaviorally meaningful properties of the
environment are made explicit. These representations are derived through
cascades of neuronal processing stages in which neurons at each stage recode
the output of preceding stages. Explanations of sensory coding may thus involve
understanding how low-level patterns are combined into more complex structures.
Although models exist in the visual domain to explain how mid-level features
such as junctions and curves might be derived from oriented filters in early
visual cortex, little is known about analogous grouping principles for
mid-level auditory representations. We propose a hierarchical generative model
of natural sounds that learns combinations of spectrotemporal features from
natural stimulus statistics. In the first layer the model forms a sparse
convolutional code of spectrograms using a dictionary of learned
spectrotemporal kernels. To generalize from specific kernel activation
patterns, the second layer encodes patterns of time-varying magnitude of
multiple first layer coefficients. Because second-layer features are sensitive
to combinations of spectrotemporal features, the representation they support
encodes more complex acoustic patterns than the first layer. When trained on
corpora of speech and environmental sounds, some second-layer units learned to
group spectrotemporal features that occur together in natural sounds. Others
instantiate opponency between dissimilar sets of spectrotemporal features. Such
groupings might be instantiated by neurons in the auditory cortex, providing a
hypothesis for mid-level neuronal computation.

	<description>Astrocytes are the most populous glial subtype and are critical for brain function. Despite this, historically there have been few studies into the role that they may have in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, however, several studies have determined that genes known to have a causative role in the development of PD are expressed in astrocytes and have important roles in astrocyte function. Here, we review these recent developments and discuss their impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of PD, and the implications that this might have for its treatment.</description>

	<description>Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) was originally identified as a slow Ca2+ sensor for lysosome fusion, but its function at fast synapses is controversial. The paper by Luo and Südhof (2017) in this issue of Neuron shows that at the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem Syt7 triggers asynchronous release during stimulus trains, resulting in reliable and temporally precise high-frequency transmission. Thus, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse.</description>

	<description>In the early 1960s, few neuroscientists attempted to model brain function using mathematics. Computers were slow and expensive, so numerical approximations of complex phenomena were out of reach in most cases, and scientists resorted primarily to analytical representations of simpler processes. The study of circuits was not new to Walter J. Freeman. He had started his education studying engineering at MIT (transferring later to the University of Chicago to study English) and was a radio operator in WWII.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Cerebellum Does More Than Sensory-Prediction-Error-Based Learning In Sensorimotor Adaptation Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139337v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139337v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Individuals with damage to the cerebellum perform poorly in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This deficit has been attributed to impairment in sensory-prediction-error-based updating of an internal forward model, a form of implicit learning. These individuals can, however, successfully counter a perturbation when instructed with an explicit aiming strategy. This successful use of an instructed aiming strategy presents a paradox: In adaptation tasks, why don't individuals with cerebellar damage come up with an aiming solution on their own to compensate for their implicit learning deficit? To explore this question, we employed a variant of a visuomotor rotation task in which, prior to executing a movement on each trial, the participants verbally reported their intended aiming location. Compared to healthy controls, participants with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) displayed impairments in both implicit learning and aiming. This was observed when the visuomotor rotation was introduced abruptly (Exp. 1) or gradually (Exp. 2). This dual deficit does not appear to be related to the increased movement variance associated with ataxia: Healthy undergraduates showed little change in implicit learning or aiming when their movement feedback was artificially manipulated to produce similar levels of variability (Exp. 3). Taken together the results indicate that a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction is not only impaired sensory-prediction-error-based learning, but also a difficulty in developing and/or maintaining an aiming solution in response to a visuomotor perturbation. We suggest that this dual deficit can be explained by the cerebellum forming part of a network that learns and maintains action-outcome associations across trials.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Non-Parametric Bayesian Prior For Causal Inference Of Auditory Streaming</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139188v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/139188v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Human perceptual grouping of sequential auditory cues has traditionally been modeled using a mechanistic approach. The problem however is essentially one of source inference - a problem that has recently been tackled using statistical Bayesian models in visual and auditory-visual modalities. Usually the models are restricted to performing inference over just one or two possible sources, but human perceptual systems have to deal with much more complex scenarios. To characterize human perception we have developed a Bayesian inference model that allows an unlimited number of signal sources to be considered: it is general enough to allow any discrete sequential cues, from any modality. The model uses a non-parametric prior, hence increased complexity of the signal does not necessitate more parameters. The model not only determines the most likely number of sources, but also specifies the source that each signal is associated with. The model gives an excellent fit to data from an auditory stream segregation experiment in which the pitch and presentation rate of pure tones determined the perceived number of sources.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local Low Frequency fMRI Synchrony Is A Proxy For The Spatial Extent Of Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138966v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138966v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fcMRI) has assumed a central role in neuroimaging efforts to understand the changes underlying brain disorders. Current models of the spatial and temporal structure of fcMRI based connectivity contain strong a priori assumptions. We report that low temporal frequency fMRI signal synchrony within the local (3 mm radius) neighborhood of a location on the cortical surface strongly predicts the scale of its global functional connectivity. This relationship is tested vertex-wise across the cortex using Spearmans rank order correlation on an individual subject basis. Furthermore, this relationship is shown to be dynamically preserved across repeated within session scans. These results provide a model free data driven method to visualize and quantitatively analyze patterns of connectivity at the imaging voxel resolution across the entire cortex on an individual subject basis. The procedure thus provides a tool to check directly the validity of spatial and temporal prior assumptions incorporated in the analysis of fcMRI data.</description>

	<description>Clinical vitamin B12 deficiency can result in megaloblastic anemia, which results from the inhibition of DNA synthesis by trapping folate cofactors in the form of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF) and subsequent inhibition of de novo thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis. In the cytosol, vitamin B12 functions in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, which...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/m91olRa14Ck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>In vertebrates thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that exerts the hormonal control of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as well as neuromodulatory functions. However, a functional equivalent in protostomian animals remains unknown, although TRH receptors are conserved in proto- and deuterostomians. Here we identify a TRH-like neuropeptide precursor...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/X87NX0-8NgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochastic resonance and optimal information transfer at criticality on a network model of the human connectome. (arXiv:1705.05248v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05248</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05248</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which noise enhances the response of
a system to an input signal. The brain is an example of a system that has to
detect and transmit signals in a noisy environment, suggesting that it is a
good candidate to take advantage of SR. In this work, we aim to identify the
optimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple
network model of the human brain. Specifically, using a dynamic model
implemented on an anatomical brain network (connectome), we investigate the
similarity between an input signal and a signal that has traveled across the
network while the system is subject to different noise levels. We find that
non-zero levels of noise enhance the similarity between the input signal and
the signal that has traveled through the system. The optimal noise level is not
unique; rather, there is a set of parameter values at which the information is
transmitted with greater precision, this set corresponds to the parameter
values that place the system in a critical regime. The multiplicity of critical
points in our model allows it to adapt to different noise situations and remain
at criticality.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Determinants of gait stability while walking on a treadmill: a machine learning approach. (arXiv:1705.05191v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05191</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05191</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic balance in human locomotion can be assessed through the local dynamic
stability (LDS) method. Whereas gait LDS has been used successfully in many
settings and applications, little is known about its sensitivity to individual
characteristics of healthy adults. Therefore, we reanalyzed a large dataset of
accelerometric data measured for 100 healthy adults from 20 to 70 years of age
performing 10 min. treadmill walking. We sought to assess the extent to which
the variations of age, body mass and height, sex, and preferred walking speed
(PWS) could influence gait LDS. The random forest (RF) and multiple adaptive
regression splines (MARS) algorithms were selected for their good bias-variance
tradeoff and their capabilities to handle nonlinear associations. First, using
variable importance measure (VIM), we used RF to evaluate which individual
characteristics had the highest influence on gait LDS. Second, we used MARS to
detect potential interactions among individual characteristics that may
influence LDS. The VIM and MARS results evidenced that PWS and age correlated
with LDS, whereas no associations were found for sex, body height, and body
mass. Further, the MARS model detected an age x PWS interaction: on one hand,
at high PWS, gait stability is constant across age while, on the other hand, at
low PWS, gait instability increases substantially with age. We conclude that it
is advisable to consider the participants' age as well as their PWS to avoid
potential biases in evaluating dynamic balance through LDS.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study we describe a methodology to realize visual images cognition in
the broader sense, by a cross-modal stimulation through the auditory channel.
An original algorithm of conversion from bi-dimensional images to sounds has
been established and tested on several subjects. Our results show that subjects
where able to discriminate with a precision of 95\% different sounds
corresponding to different test geometric shapes. Moreover, after brief
learning sessions on simple images, subjects where able to recognize among a
group of 16 complex and never-trained images a single target by hearing its
acoustical counterpart. Rate of recognition was found to depend on image
characteristics, in 90% of the cases, subjects did better than choosing at
random. This study contribute to the understanding of cross-modal perception
and help for the realization of systems that use acoustical signals to help
visually impaired persons to recognize objects and improve navigation

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain processes a wide variety of inputs and does so either
consciously or subconsciously. According to the Global Workspace theory,
conscious processing involves broadcasting of information to several regions of
the brain and subconscious processing involves more localized processing. This
theoretical paper aims to expand on some of the aspects of the Global Workspace
theory: how the properties of incoming information result in it being processed
subconsciously or consciously; why processing can be either be sustained or
short-lived; how the Global Workspace theory may apply both to real-time
sensory input as well as to internally retained information. This paper
proposes that: familiar input which does not elicit intense emotions becomes
processed subconsciously and such processing can be continuous and sustained;
input that elicits relatively intense emotions is subjected to highly
sustainable conscious processing; input can also undergo meta-conscious
processing. Such processing is not very sustainable but can exert control over
other cognitive processes. This paper also discusses possible benefits of
regulating cognitive processes this way.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04739</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of nine assessments
of face processing skills. These tests have been used commonly in recent years
to gauge the skills of perspective 'super-recognisers' with respect to the
general population. In the literature, a person has been considered to be a
'super-recogniser' based on superior scores on one or more of these tests (cf.,
Noyes, Phillips &amp;amp; O'Toole, in press). The paper provides a supplement to a
recent review of super-recognisers aimed at readers who are unfamiliar with
these tests. That review provides a complete summary of the super-recongiser
literature to date (2017). It also provides a theory and a set of action points
directed at answering the question &quot;What is a super-recogniser?&quot;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03492</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that the brain performs approximate probabilistic
inference to estimate causal variables in the world from ambiguous sensory
data. To understand these computations, we need to analyze how information is
represented and transformed by the actions of nonlinear recurrent neural
networks. We propose that these probabilistic computations function by a
message-passing algorithm operating at the level of redundant neural
populations. To explain this framework, we review its underlying concepts,
including graphical models, sufficient statistics, and message-passing, and
then describe how these concepts could be implemented by recurrently connected
probabilistic population codes. The relevant information flow in these networks
will be most interpretable at the population level, particularly for redundant
neural codes. We therefore outline a general approach to identify the essential
features of a neural message-passing algorithm. Finally, we argue that to
reveal the most important aspects of these neural computations, we must study
large-scale activity patterns during moderately complex, naturalistic
behaviors.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00001</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many stochastic dynamical systems, ordinary chaotic behavior is preceded
by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or
scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes,
etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized
criticality, the recently found approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastics (STS) identifies this phase as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase),
i.e., the phase where the topological supersymmetry pertaining to all
stochastic dynamical systems is broken spontaneously by the condensation of the
noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here, we support this picture in the context
of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of neuron-like elements and find that the
dynamics in the N-phase is indeed featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov
exponents and dominated by (anti)instantonic processes of
(creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks, which can be viewed as
predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also construct the phase
diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey neuromorphic hardware
and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in the deterministic
limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the application of STS to
neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain can reside only in
the N-phase.

High-order epistasis—where the effect of a mutation is determined by interactions with two or more other mutations—makes small, but detectable, contributions to genotype-fitness maps. While epistasis between pairs of mutations is known to be an important determinant of evolutionary trajectories, the evolutionary consequences of high-order epistasis remain poorly understood. To determine the effect of high-order epistasis on evolutionary trajectories, we computationally removed high-order epistasis from experimental genotype-fitness maps containing all binary combinations of five mutations. We then compared trajectories through maps both with and without high-order epistasis. We found that high-order epistasis strongly shapes the accessibility and probability of evolutionary trajectories. A closer analysis revealed that the magnitude of epistasis, not its order, predicts is effects on evolutionary trajectories. We further find that high-order epistasis makes it impossible to predict evolutionary trajectories from the individual and paired effects of mutations. We therefore conclude that high-order epistasis profoundly shapes evolutionary trajectories through genotype-fitness maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NtwkDDZsJfQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint, the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other microbes in the community. This is particularly important for predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes significant restrictions on the allowable community membership, composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement. SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis. SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a microbial community in a given environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aaCKYVh0KtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-wide expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies in humans have provided numerous insights into the genetics of both gene expression and complex diseases. While the majority of eQTL identified in genome-wide analyses impact a single gene, eQTL that impact many genes are particularly valuable for network modeling and disease analysis. To enable the identification of such broad impact eQTL, we introduce CONFETI: Confounding Factor Estimation Through Independent component analysis. CONFETI is designed to address two conflicting issues when searching for broad impact eQTL: the need to account for non-genetic confounding factors that can lower the power of the analysis or produce broad impact eQTL false positives, and the tendency of methods that account for confounding factors to model broad impact eQTL as non-genetic variation. The key advance of the CONFETI framework is the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify variation likely caused by broad impact eQTL when constructing the sample covariance matrix used for the random effect in a mixed model. We show that CONFETI has better performance than other mixed model confounding factor methods when considering broad impact eQTL recovery from synthetic data. We also used the CONFETI framework and these same confounding factor methods to identify eQTL that replicate between matched twin pair datasets in the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER), the Depression Genes Networks study (DGN), the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), and multiple tissue types in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. These analyses identified both &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL impacting individual genes, and CONFETI had better or comparable performance to other mixed model confounding factor analysis methods when identifying such eQTL. In these analyses, we were able to identify and replicate a few broad impact eQTL although the overall number was small even when applying CONFETI. In light of these results, we discuss the broad impact eQTL that have been previously reported from the analysis of human data and suggest that considerable caution should be exercised when making biological inferences based on these reported eQTL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZIqMhY0aoqQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A predictive coding account of bistable perception - a model-based fMRI study</title>

In bistable vision, subjective perception wavers between two interpretations of a constant ambiguous stimulus. This dissociation between conscious perception and sensory stimulation has motivated various empirical studies on the neural correlates of bistable perception, but the neurocomputational mechanism behind endogenous perceptual transitions has remained elusive. Here, we recurred to a generic Bayesian framework of predictive coding and devised a model that casts endogenous perceptual transitions as a consequence of prediction errors emerging from residual evidence for the suppressed percept. Data simulations revealed close similarities between the model’s predictions and key temporal characteristics of perceptual bistability, indicating that the model was able to reproduce bistable perception. Fitting the predictive coding model to behavioural data from an fMRI-experiment on bistable perception, we found a correlation across participants between the model parameter encoding perceptual stabilization and the behaviourally measured frequency of perceptual transitions, corroborating that the model successfully accounted for participants’ perception. Formal model comparison with established models of bistable perception based on mutual inhibition and adaptation, noise or a combination of adaptation and noise was used for the validation of the predictive coding model against the established models. Most importantly, model-based analyses of the fMRI data revealed that prediction error time-courses derived from the predictive coding model correlated with neural signal time-courses in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and anterior insulae. Voxel-wise model selection indicated a superiority of the predictive coding model over conventional analysis approaches in explaining neural activity in these frontal areas, suggesting that frontal cortex encodes prediction errors that mediate endogenous perceptual transitions in bistable perception. Taken together, our current work provides a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of behavioural and neural data using a predictive coding perspective on bistable perception. In this, our approach posits a crucial role of prediction error signalling for the resolution of perceptual ambiguities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X6E3z9L-p5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mixture models reveal multiple positional bias types in RNA-Seq data and lead to accurate transcript concentration estimates</title>

Accuracy of transcript quantification with RNA-Seq is negatively affected by positional fragment bias. This article introduces Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (rd. “mixquare”), a transcript quantification method which uses a mixture of probability distributions to model and thereby neutralize the effects of positional fragment bias. The parameters of Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are trained by Expectation Maximization resulting in simultaneous transcript abundance and bias estimates. We compare Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to Cufflinks, RSEM, eXpress and PennSeq; state-of-the-art quantification methods implementing some form of bias correction. On four synthetic biases we show that the accuracy of Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; overall exceeds the accuracy of the other methods and that its bias estimates converge to the correct solution. We further evaluate Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on real RNA-Seq data from the Microarray and Sequencing Quality Control (MAQC, SEQC) Consortia. On MAQC data, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieves improved correlation to qPCR measurements with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 4% and 50%. Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; also yields repeatable concentration estimates across technical replicates with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 8% and 47% and reduced standard deviation across the full concentration range. We further observe more accurate detection of differential expression with a relative increase in true positives between 74% and 378% for 5% false positives. In addition, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reveals 5 dominant biases in MAQC data deviating from the common assumption of a uniform fragment distribution. On SEQC data, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; yields higher consistency between measured and predicted concentration ratios. A relative error of 20% or less is obtained for 51% of transcripts by Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 40% of transcripts by Cufflinks and RSEM and 30% by eXpress. Titration order consistency is correct for 47% of transcripts for Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 41% for Cufflinks and RSEM and 34% for eXpress. We, further, observe improved repeatability across laboratory sites with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 8% and 44% and reduced standard deviation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E8FD3x2evB0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity.</description>

	<description>Brain dynamic changes associated with schizophrenia are largely equivocal, with interpretation complicated by many factors, such as the presence of therapeutic agents and the complex nature of the syndrome itself. Evidence for a brain-wide change in individual network oscillations, shared by all patients, is largely equivocal, but stronger for lower (delta) than for higher (gamma) bands. However, region-specific changes in rhythms across multiple, interdependent, nested frequencies may correlate better with pathology.</description>

Imaging and analyzing the locomotion behavior of small animals such as Drosophila larvae or C. elegans worms has become an integral subject of biological research. In the past we have introduced FIM, a novel imaging system feasible to extract high contrast images. This system in combination with the associated tracking software FIMTrack is already used by many groups all over the world. However, so far there has not been an in-depth discussion of the technical aspects. Here we elaborate on the implementation details of FIMTrack and give an in-depth explanation of the used algorithms. Among others, the software offers several tracking strategies to cover a wide range of different model organisms, locomotion types, and camera properties. Furthermore, the software facilitates stimuli-based analysis in combination with built-in manual tracking and correction functionalities. All features are integrated in an easy-to-use graphical user interface. To demonstrate the potential of FIMTrack we provide an evaluation of its accuracy using manually labeled data. The source code is available under the GNU GPLv3 at https://github.com/i-git/FIMTrack and pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Mac are available at http://fim.uni-muenster.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RnKp9roQszY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying stochastic oscillations in single-cell live imaging time series using Gaussian processes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005479</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nick E. Phillips, Cerys Manning, Nancy Papalopulu, Magnus Rattray&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple biological processes are driven by oscillatory gene expression at different time scales. Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and single-cell live imaging of gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators. This underlies a new challenge to the experimentalist because neither intuition nor pre-existing methods work well for identifying oscillatory activity in noisy biological time series. Thus, there is an acute need for an objective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived noisy time series is periodic. Here, we present a new data analysis method that combines mechanistic stochastic modelling with the powerful methods of non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. We show that our method outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying cells as oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic oscillator model and in experimental data. Analysis of bioluminescent live-cell imaging shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by a &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; promoter (10/19), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5’ LTR (MMLV) promoter (0/25). The method can be applied to data from any gene network to both quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a population and to measure the period and quality of oscillations.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Short-term activity cycles impede information transmission in ant colonies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005527</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas O. Richardson, Jonas I. Liechti, Nathalie Stroeymeyt, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Laurent Keller&lt;/p&gt;

Rhythmical activity patterns are ubiquitous in nature. We study an oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on biological networks because the interactions between the component parts are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony. To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect, and present evidence in support of it.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5hhqdumyrcA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Immune-Induced Fever Is Dependent on Local But Not Generalized Prostaglandin E2 Synthesis in the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5035?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5035?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fever occurs upon binding of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to EP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, but the origin of the pyrogenic PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has not been clearly determined. Here, using mice of both sexes, we examined the role of local versus generalized PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in the brain for the febrile response. In wild-type mice and in mice with genetic deletion of the prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in the brain endothelium, generated with an inducible CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Slco1c1&lt;/i&gt; promoter, PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the CSF were only weakly related to the magnitude of the febrile response, whereas the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesizing capacity in the hypothalamus, as reflected in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA, showed strong correlation with the immune-induced fever. Histological analysis showed that the deletion of cyclooxygenase-2 in brain endothelial cells occurred preferentially in small- and medium-sized vessels deep in the brain parenchyma, such as in the hypothalamus, whereas larger vessels, and particularly those close to the neocortical surface and in the meninges, were left unaffected, hence leaving PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis largely intact in major parts of the brain while significantly reducing it in the region critical for the febrile response. Furthermore, injection of a virus vector expressing microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) into the median preoptic nucleus of fever-refractive mPGES-1 knock-out mice, resulted in a temperature elevation in response to LPS. We conclude that the febrile response is dependent on local release of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto its target neurons and not on the overall PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By using mice with selective deletion of prostaglandin synthesis in brain endothelial cells, we demonstrate that local prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production in deep brain areas, such as the hypothalamus, which is the site of thermoregulatory neurons, is critical for the febrile response to peripheral inflammation. In contrast, PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in other brain areas and the overall PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level in the brain do not influence the febrile response. Furthermore, partly restoring the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesizing capacity in the anterior hypothalamus of mice lacking such capacity with a lentiviral vector resulted in a temperature elevation in response to LPS. These data imply that the febrile response is dependent on the local release of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto its target neurons, possibly by a paracrine mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Inferotemporal Cortex Cells Use Multiple Input Pathways for Shape Encoding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5019?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5019?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the macaque monkey brain, posterior inferior temporal (PIT) cortex cells contribute to visual object recognition. They receive concurrent inputs from visual areas V4, V3, and V2. We asked how these different anatomical pathways shape PIT response properties by deactivating them while monitoring PIT activity in two male macaques. We found that cooling of V4 or V2|3 did not lead to consistent changes in population excitatory drive; however, population pattern analyses showed that V4-based pathways were more important than V2|3-based pathways. We did not find any image features that predicted decoding accuracy differences between both interventions. Using the HMAX hierarchical model of visual recognition, we found that different groups of simulated &quot;PIT&quot; units with different input histories (lacking &quot;V2|3&quot; or &quot;V4&quot; input) allowed for comparable levels of object-decoding performance and that removing a large fraction of &quot;PIT&quot; activity resulted in similar drops in performance as in the cooling experiments. We conclude that distinct input pathways to PIT relay similar types of shape information, with V1-dependent V4 cells providing more quantitatively useful information for overall encoding than cells in V2 projecting directly to PIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Convolutional neural networks are the best models of the visual system, but most emphasize input transformations across a serial hierarchy akin to the primary &quot;ventral stream&quot; (V1 -&amp;gt; V2 -&amp;gt; V4 -&amp;gt; IT). However, the ventral stream also comprises parallel &quot;bypass&quot; pathways: V1 also connects to V4, and V2 to IT. To explore the advantages of mixing long and short pathways in the macaque brain, we used cortical cooling to silence inputs to posterior IT and compared the findings with an HMAX model with parallel pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Modulation of the Pupil Light Reflex by Microstimulation of Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5008?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5008?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to flexibly regulate sensorimotor responses, perhaps through modulating activity in other circuits. However, the scope of that control remains unknown: it remains unclear whether the PFC can modulate basic reflexes. One canonical example of a central reflex is the pupil light reflex (PLR): the automatic constriction of the pupil in response to luminance increments. Unlike pupil size, which depends on the interaction of multiple physiological and neuromodulatory influences, the PLR reflects the action of a simple brainstem circuit. However, emerging behavioral evidence suggests that the PLR may be modulated by cognitive processes. Although the neural basis of these modulations remains unknown, one possible source is the PFC, particularly the frontal eye field (FEF), an area of the PFC implicated in the control of attention. We show that microstimulation of the rhesus macaque FEF alters the magnitude of the PLR in a spatially specific manner. FEF microstimulation enhanced the PLR to probes presented within the stimulated visual field, but suppressed the PLR to probes at nonoverlapping locations. The spatial specificity of this effect parallels the effect of FEF stimulation on attention and suggests that FEF is capable of modulating visuomotor transformations performed at a lower level than was previously known. These results provide evidence of the selective regulation of a basic brainstem reflex by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pupil light reflex (PLR) is our brain's first and most fundamental mechanism for light adaptation. Although it is often described in textbooks as being an immutable reflex, converging evidence suggests that the magnitude of the PLR is modulated by cognitive factors. The neural bases of these modulations are unknown. Here, we report that microstimulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulates the gain of the PLR, changing how a simple reflex circuit responds to physically identical stimuli. These results suggest that control structures such as the PFC can add complexity and flexibility to even a basic brainstem circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Spacing Effect for Structural Synaptic Plasticity Provides Specificity and Precision in Plastic Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/4992?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to trials of training without intervals (massed training), training trials spaced over time (spaced training) induce a more persistent memory identified as long-term memory (LTM). This phenomenon, known as the spacing effect for memory, is poorly understood. LTM is supported by structural synaptic plasticity; however, how synapses integrate spaced stimuli remains elusive. Here, we analyzed events of structural synaptic plasticity at the single-synapse level after distinct patterns of stimulation in motoneurons of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We found that the spacing effect is a phenomenon detected at synaptic level, which determines the specificity and the precision in structural synaptic plasticity. Whereas a single pulse of stimulation (massed) induced structural synaptic plasticity, the same amount of stimulation divided in three spaced stimuli completely prevented it. This inhibitory effect was determined by the length of the interstimulus intervals. The inhibitory effect of the spacing was lost by suppressing the activity of Ras or mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas the overexpression of Ras-WT enhanced it. Moreover, dividing the same total time of stimulation into five or more stimuli produced a higher precision in the number of events of plasticity. Ras mutations associated with intellectual disability abolished the spacing effect and led neurons to decode distinct stimulation patterns as massed stimulation. This evidence suggests that the spacing effect for memory may result from the effect of the spacing in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be a property not limited to neurons involved in learning and memory. We propose a model of spacing-dependent structural synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-term memory (LTM) induced by repeated trials spaced over time is known as the spacing effect, a common property in the animal kingdom. Altered mechanisms in the spacing effect have been found in animal models of disorders with intellectual disability, such as Noonan syndrome. Although LTM is sustained by structural synaptic plasticity, how synapses integrate spaced stimuli and decode them into specific plastic changes remains elusive. Here, we show that the spacing effect is a phenomenon detected at the synaptic level, which determines the properties of the response in structural plasticity, including precision of such response. Whereas suppressing or enhancing Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling changed how synapses decode a pattern of stimuli, a disease-related Ras allele abolished the spacing effect for plastic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CT Perfusion to Predict Response to Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24953</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24953</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess the utility of CT perfusion for selection of patients for endovascular therapy up to 18 hours after symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 min after a baseline CTP. Patients were classified as ‘target mismatch' if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as &amp;gt;50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included; mean age 66 years, median NIHSS 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy 5.2 hours. Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n=131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIH Stroke Scale (83% vs 44%, p=0.002; adjusted OR=6.6; 95% CI 2.1-20.9). This association did not differ between patients treated within 6 hrs (OR = 6.4; 95% CI 1.5-27.8) and those treated beyond 6 hrs after symptom onset (OR = 13.7; 95% CI 1.4-140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The robust association between endovascular reperfusion and good outcome among patients with the CT perfusion target mismatch profile treated up to 18 hours after symptom onset supports a randomized trial of endovascular therapy in this patient population.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To evaluate nonpublication rates among trials of new successful and unsuccessful neurological drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: ‘Licensed' drugs consisted of all novel agents receiving FDA licensure 2005 to 2012 inclusive in seven neurological disorders. ‘Stalled' drugs included all experimental agents tested in the same domains that had at least one completed phase III trial in the same timeframe but failed to receive FDA approval. Trials of these drugs were included in our sample if their primary outcome collection occurred before October 1, 2010. We determined the publication status of eligible trials using searches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;, Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, sponsor websites, and direct electronic query of trial contacts and sponsors. The primary outcome was time to journal publication (or results reporting in other media) after study completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The adjusted hazard ratio for publication was 1.79 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.67) in favour of licensed drugs. Based on the criteria for nonpublication in this report, 14,092 and 33,882 volunteers participated in unpublished trials of licensed and stalled neurological drugs, respectively. Result data were not publicly available in any form for 10% (16/163) and 46% (94/203) of trials of licensed and stalled drugs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Results of trials for stalled drugs are heavily underreported. This deprives research and care communities of evidence about pathophysiology, drug class effects, and the value of surrogate endpoints in trials. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect experienced by patients receiving treatment for cancer. Approximately 30-40% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy will develop CIPN and there is considerable variability in its severity between patients. It is often sensory-predominant with pain and can lead to long-term morbidity in survivors. The prevalence and burden of CIPN late effects will likely increase as cancer survival rates continue to improve. In this review, we discuss the approach to peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer and address the clinical phenotypes and pathomechanisms of specific neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

Normative models of human cognition often appeal to Bayesian filtering, which provides optimal online estimates of unknown or hidden states of the world, based on previous observations. However, in many cases it is necessary to optimise beliefs about sequences of states rather than just the current state. Importantly, Bayesian filtering and sequential inference strategies make different predictions about beliefs and subsequent choices, rendering them behaviourally dissociable. Taking data from a probabilistic reversal task we show that subjects’ choices provide strong evidence that they are representing short sequences of states. Between-subject measures of this implicit sequential inference strategy had a neurobiological underpinning and correlated with grey matter density in prefrontal and parietal cortex, as well as the hippocampus. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence for sequential inference in human cognition, and by exploiting between subject variation in this measure we provide pointers to its neuronal substrates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XLtyEDtEW7A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Single-molecule protein identification by sub-nanopore sensors</title>

Recent advances in top-down mass spectrometry enabled identification of intact proteins, but this technology still faces challenges. For example, top-down mass spectrometry suffers from a lack of sensitivity since the ion counts for a single fragmentation event are often low. In contrast, nanopore technology is exquisitely sensitive to single intact molecules, but it has only been successfully applied to DNA sequencing, so far. Here, we explore the potential of sub-nanopores for single-molecule protein identification (SMPI) and describe an algorithm for identification of the electrical current blockade signal (nanospectrum) resulting from the translocation of a denaturated, linearly charged protein through a sub-nanopore. The analysis of identification p-values suggests that the current technology is already sufficient for matching nanospectra against small protein databases, e.g., protein identification in bacterial proteomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWPCIZAkdQ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mutation in the Tubb4a gene leads to microtubule accumulation with hypomyelination and demyelination</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on previous localization of the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; mutation to rat chromosome 9, we tested whether the mutation resided within the &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (β-tubulin 4A) gene, because mutations in the &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; gene have been described in patients with central nervous system hypomyelination. To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination, we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2-year-old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of severe hypomyelination were studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat ages, there is progressive loss of myelin in the brain and dorsal column of the spinal cord associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers with accumulation of microtubules. This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes, but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24930-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat is the first animal model of &lt;em&gt;TUBB4&lt;/em&gt; mutations in humans and a novel system in which to test the mechanism of microtubule accumulation. The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 5 cases of acute heart failure (AHF) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. AHF was inaugural in 3 patients, always preceded or accompanied by signs of brainstem dysfunction; it was severe, requiring intensive care management. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypokinesis. No other cause of AHF has been found. All patients showed a new medullary lesion on brain magnetic resonance imaging. All had rapid and complete recovery of ventricular function after intravenous corticosteroids. We concluded that the cases represent a takotsubo phenomenon. Physicians should be aware of rare cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in MS relapses. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005535</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Franks, Edoardo Airoldi, Nikolai Slavov&lt;/p&gt;

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vF6zRaymzxo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Epidemiological modeling of &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;: Low stercorarian transmission and failure of host adaptive immunity explain the frequency of mixed infections in humans</title>

People living in areas with active vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease have multiple contacts with its causative agent, &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;. Reinfections by &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; are possible at least in animal models leading to lower or even hardly detectable parasitaemia. In humans, although reinfections are thought to have major public health implications by increasing the risk of chronic manifestations of the disease, there is little quantitative knowledge about their frequency and the timing of parasite re-inoculation in the course of the disease. Here, we implemented stochastic agent-based models i) to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and ii) to assess how frequent are reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease according to alternative hypotheses on the adaptive immune response following a primary infection. By using a hybrid genetic algorithm, the models were fitted to epidemiological data of Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; reach 56% in humans. To explain this percentage, the best model predicted 0.032 (0.008–0.042) annual reinfections per individual with 98.4% of them occurring in the chronic phase. In addition, the parasite escapes to the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of the events of re-inoculation. With these low annual rates, the risks of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stand around 14% (4%-18%) and 60% (21%-70%) after 5 and 30 years, with most individuals being re-infected 1–3 times overall. These low rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response. Those estimates are of particular interest for vaccine development and for our understanding of the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2z3OJKtFYUE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The decay of motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics reveals an asymmetry in the stability of motion state-dependent learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005492</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EIDcYz4LMtU/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eghbal A. Hosseini, Katrina P. Nguyen, Wilsaan M. Joiner&lt;/p&gt;

Motor adaptation paradigms provide a quantitative method to study short-term modification of motor commands. Despite the growing understanding of the role motion states (e.g., velocity) play in this form of motor learning, there is little information on the relative stability of memories based on these movement characteristics, especially in comparison to the initial adaptation. Here, we trained subjects to make reaching movements perturbed by force patterns dependent upon either limb position or velocity. Following training, subjects were exposed to a series of error-clamp trials to measure the temporal characteristics of the feedforward motor output during the decay of learning. The compensatory force patterns were largely based on the perturbation kinematic (e.g., velocity), but also showed a small contribution from the other motion kinematic (e.g., position). However, the velocity contribution in response to the position-based perturbation decayed at a slower rate than the position contribution to velocity-based training, suggesting a difference in stability. Next, we modified a previous model of motor adaptation to reflect this difference and simulated the behavior for different learning goals. We were interested in the stability of learning when the perturbations were based on different combinations of limb position or velocity that subsequently resulted in biased amounts of motion-based learning. We trained additional subjects on these combined motion-state perturbations and confirmed the predictions of the model. Specifically, we show that (1) there is a significant separation between the observed gain-space trajectories for the learning and decay of adaptation and (2) for combined motion-state perturbations, the gain associated to changes in limb position decayed at a faster rate than the velocity-dependent gain, even when the position-dependent gain at the end of training was significantly greater. Collectively, these results suggest that the state-dependent adaptation associated with movement velocity is relatively more stable than that based on position.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EIDcYz4LMtU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pyrimethamine Significantly Lowers CSF/SOD1 in ALS Patients With SOD1 Mutations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24950</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24950</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Background:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) reduction prolongs survival in SOD1-transgenic animal models. Pyrimethamine produces dose dependent SOD1 reduction in cell culture systems. A previous phase-1 trial showed pyrimethamine lowers SOD1 levels in leucocytes in patients with &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. This study investigated whether pyrimethamine lowered SOD1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients carrying &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations linked to ALS (fALS/SOD1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods and Study Design:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Multicenter (5 sites), open-label, 9-month duration, dose-ranging, to determine safety and efficacy of pyrimethamine to lower SOD1 levels in the CSF of FALS/SOD1. All participants underwent 3 lumbar punctures, blood draw, clinical assessment of strength, motor function, quality of life, and adverse effects assessments. SOD1 levels were measured in erythrocytes and CSF. Pyrimethamine was measured in plasma and CSF. Appel ALS, ALSFRS-R and single item McGill Quality of Life (SIS-MQoL) were measured at screening, visit 6 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We enrolled 32 patients; 24 completed 6 visits (18 weeks) and 21 completed all study visits. A linear mixed effects model showed a significant reduction in CSF SOD1 at visit 6 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a mean reduction of 13.5% (95% CI: 8.4, 18.5) and at visit 9 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a mean reduction of 10.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 15.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Pyrimethamine is safe and well tolerated in ALS. Pyrimethamine is capable of producing a significant reduction in total CSF SOD1 protein content in patients with ALS caused by different &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. Further long-term studies are warranted to assess clinical efficacy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Widespread position-specific conservation of synonymous rare codons within coding sequences</title>

Synonymous rare codons are considered to be sub-optimal for gene expression because they are translated more slowly than common codons. Yet surprisingly, many protein coding sequences include large clusters of synonymous rare codons. Rare codons at the 5’ terminus of coding sequences have been shown to increase translational efficiency. Although a general functional role for synonymous rare codons farther within coding sequences has not yet been established, several recent reports have identified rare-to-common synonymous codon substitutions that impair folding of the encoded protein. Here we test the hypothesis that although the usage frequencies of synonymous codons change from organism to organism, codon rarity will be conserved at specific positions in a set of homologous coding sequences, for example to tune translation rate without altering a protein sequence. Such conservation of rarity–rather than specific codon identity–could coordinate co-translational folding of the encoded protein. We demonstrate that many rare codon cluster positions are indeed conserved within homologous coding sequences across diverse eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal species, suggesting they result from positive selection and have a functional role. Most conserved rare codon clusters occur within rather than between conserved protein domains, challenging the view that their primary function is to facilitate co-translational folding after synthesis of an autonomous structural unit. Instead, many conserved rare codon clusters separate smaller protein structural motifs within structural domains. These smaller motifs typically fold faster than an entire domain, on a time scale more consistent with translation rate modulation by synonymous codon usage. While proteins with conserved rare codon clusters are structurally and functionally diverse, they are enriched in functions associated with organism growth and development, suggesting an important role for synonymous codon usage in organism physiology. The identification of conserved rare codon clusters advances our understanding of distinct, functional roles for otherwise synonymous codons and enables experimental testing of the impact of synonymous codon usage on the production of functional proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LTnUBqKLU7k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A systems-level model reveals that 1,2-Propanediol utilization microcompartments enhance pathway flux through intermediate sequestration</title>

The spatial organization of metabolism is common to all domains of life. Enteric and other bacteria use subcellular organelles known as bacterial microcompartments to spatially organize the metabolism of pathogenicity-relevant carbon sources, such as 1,2-propanediol. The organelles are thought to sequester a private cofactor pool, minimize the effects of toxic intermediates, and enhance flux through the encapsulated metabolic pathways. We develop a mathematical model of the function of the 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; and use it to analyze the function of the microcompartment organelles in detail. Our model makes accurate estimates of doubling times based on an optimized compartment shell permeability determined by maximizing metabolic flux in the model. The compartments function primarily to decouple cytosolic intermediate concentrations from the concentrations in the microcompartment, allowing significant enhancement in pathway flux by the generation of large concentration gradients across the microcompartment shell. We find that selective permeability of the microcompartment shell is not absolutely necessary, but is often beneficial in establishing this intermediate-trapping function. Our findings also implicate active transport of the 1,2-propanediol substrate under conditions of low external substrate concentration, and we present a mathematical bound, in terms of external 1,2-propanediol substrate concentration and diffusive rates, on when active transport of the substrate is advantageous. By allowing us to predict experimentally inaccessible aspects of microcompartment function, such as intra-microcompartment metabolite concentrations, our model presents avenues for future research and underscores the importance of carefully considering changes in external metabolite concentrations and other conditions during batch cultures. Our results also suggest that the encapsulation of heterologous pathways in bacterial microcompartments might yield significant benefits for pathway flux, as well as for toxicity mitigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LNEkJwfg_Ag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mutations in the nuclear gene, &lt;em&gt;TK2&lt;/em&gt;, cause TK2 deficiency, which manifests predominantly in children as myopathy with mtDNA depletion. Molecular bypass therapy with the TK2 products, deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), prolongs the life span of Tk2-deficient (Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice by 2- to 3-fold. Because we observed rapid catabolism of the deoxynucleoside monophosphates to deoxythymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine (dC), we hypothesized that: (1) deoxynucleosides might be the major active agents and (2) inhibition of deoxycytidine deamination might enhance dTMP+dCMP therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In contrast, dCMP+dTMP+THU therapy decreased life span of Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared to dCMP+dTMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied whether continuous lower normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid β1-42 (≥640pg/ml) levels were related with rate of clinical progression in a sample of 393 nondemented memory clinic patients. Lower normal levels were associated with faster clinical progression, and this depended on baseline cognitive status (subjective cognitive decline: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05; mild cognitive impairment: HR = 0.19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .01), indicating that normal CSF amyloid levels do not exclude incident Alzheimer disease. These findings suggest that research on preclinical markers for Alzheimer disease should take the continuum of CSF amyloid β1-42 levels within the normal range into account.

Two approaches were used: gray scale level (GSL), measured from the ultrasound image, and quantitative backscatter analysis (QBA), measured directly from the received echoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSL and QBA were obtained from 6 unilateral arm/leg muscles in 36 boys with DMD and 28 healthy boys (age = 2–14 years) for up to 2 years. We used a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and slope terms to compare trajectories of GSL, QBA, and functional assessments. We analyzed separately a subset of boys who initiated corticosteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to healthy boys, increasing GSL in DMD boys &amp;gt;7.0 years old was first identified at 6 months (eg, anterior forearm slope difference of 1.16 arbitrary units/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–1.94); in boys ≤ 7 years old, differences in GSL first appeared at 12 months (0.82 arbitrary units/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.075–1.565, in rectus femoris). QBA performed similarly to GSL (eg, DMD boys &amp;gt; 7 years old: 0.41dB/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01, 95% CI = 0.096–0.72, in anterior forearm at 6 months). Ultrasound identified differences earlier than functional measures including 6-minute walk and supine-to-stand tests. However, neither QBA nor GSL showed an effect of corticosteroid initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;QBA performs similarly to GSL, and both appear more sensitive than functional assessments for detecting muscle deterioration in DMD. Additional studies will be required to determine whether quantitative muscle ultrasound can detect therapeutic efficacy. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In this study, we evaluated whether electrical impedance myography (EIM) could serve this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this nonblinded study, 36 boys with DMD and 29 age-similar healthy boys underwent multifrequency EIM measurements for up to 2 years on 6 muscles unilaterally along with functional assessments. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms was used for the analysis of multifrequency EIM values and functional measures. Seven DMD boys were initiated on corticosteroids; these data were analyzed using a piecewise linear mixed-effects model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In boys &amp;gt; 7.0 years old, a significant difference in the slope of EIM phase ratio trajectories in the upper extremity was observed by 6 months of −0.074/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.013, −0.14; at 2 years, this difference was −0.048/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% CI = −0.028, −0.068. In boys ≤ 7.0 years old, differences appeared at 6 months in gastrocnemius (EIM phase slope = −0.83 °/kHz/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, 95% CI = −0.26, −1.40). EIM outcomes showed significant differences earlier than functional tests. Initiation of corticosteroids significantly improved the slope of EIM phase ratio (0.057/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00019, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.086) and EIM phase slope (0.14 °/kHz/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.013, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.25), consistent with corticosteroids' known clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EIM detects deterioration in muscles of both younger and older boys by 6 months; it also identifies the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid initiation. Because EIM is rapid to apply, painless, and requires minimal operator training, the technique deserves to be further evaluated as a biomarker in DMD clinical therapeutic trials.

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Christoph Anacker &amp;amp; René Hen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive processes, such as pattern separation, and in the behavioural effects of stress and antidepressants. Young adult-born neurons have been shown to inhibit the overall activity of the dentate gyrus by recruiting local interneurons, which may result in &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sublethal oligodendrocyte injury: A reversible condition in multiple sclerosis?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of oligodendroglial distal processes has been identified as an early event in MS lesion development. Our objective was to further define the development of the “dying-back” oligodendrocyte lesion in situ and to model the development and potential reversibility of such responses using dissociated cultures of adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; In situ analyses were performed on glutaraldehyde-fixed thin sections of clinically acute and pathologically active cases of MS. In vitro studies were conducted using adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes challenged by metabolic stress conditions (low nutrient/glucose).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In situ analyses indicated a spectrum of myelin changes in the presence of morphologically intact oligodendrocytes; these included degeneration of the inner cytoplasmic tongue with increasing sizes of intramyelinic bleb formation that could result in radial fractures of the myelin sheath. Macrophages with ingested myelin fragments were identified only once the fragmentation was established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vitro studies indicated that oligodendrocyte process retraction that was linked to reduced glycolytic respiratory activity is reversible until a critical time point. Subsequent cell death was not linked to caspase-3 dependent programs. Gene expression studies conducted at the latest reversible time point revealed reduced expression of pathways associated with cell process outgrowth and myelination, as well as with metabolic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings reveal the potential to protect and possibly restore myelin elaborated by existent oligodendrocytes in early and evolving MS lesions, and suggest the necessity of ongoing studies on the mechanisms underlying subsequent adult human oligodendrocyte cell death.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: STN-DBS is neuroprotective in the A53T α-synuclein Parkinson's disease rat model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24947</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24947</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a highly effective symptomatic therapy for motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). An additional, disease-modifying effect has been suspected from studies in toxin-based PD animal models, but these models do not reflect the molecular pathology and progressive nature of PD, that would be required to evaluate a disease-modifying action. Defining a disease-modifying effect, could radically change the way in which DBS is used in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We applied STN-DBS in an AAV1/2-driven human mutated A53T α-synuclein (aSyn)-overexpressing PD rat model (AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn). Rats were injected unilaterally, in the substantia nigra (SN), with AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn or control vector. Three weeks later, after behavioural and nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficits had developed, rats underwent STN-DBS electrode implantation ipsilateral to the vector-injected SN. Stimulation lasted for three weeks. Control groups remained OFF stimulation. Animals were sacrificed at six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Motor performance in the single pellet reaching task was impaired in the AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn injected stim-OFF group, six weeks after AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn injection, compared to pre-operative levels (-82%, P&amp;lt;0.01). Deficits were reversed in AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn, stim-ON rats after three weeks of active stimulation, compared to the AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn stim-OFF rats (an increase of ∼400%, P&amp;lt;0.05), demonstrating a beneficial effect of DBS. This motor improvement was maintained when the stimulation was turned off and was accompanied by a higher number of TH+ SN neurons (increase of ∼29%), compared to AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn stim-OFF rats (P&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Our data support the putative neuroprotective and disease-modifying effect of STN-DBS in a mechanistically-relevant model of PD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Early prediction of coma recovery after cardiac arrest with blinded pupillometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24943</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prognostication studies on comatose cardiac arrest (CA) patients are limited by lack of blinding, potentially causing overestimation of outcome predictors and self-fulfilling prophecy. Using a blinded approach, we analysed the value of quantitative automated pupillometry to predict neurological recovery after CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a prospective cohort of 103 comatose adult patients who were unconscious 48 hours after CA and underwent repeated measurements of quantitative pupillary light reflex (PLR) using the Neurolight-Algiscan® device. Clinical examination, electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) were performed in parallel, as part of standard multimodal assessment. Automated pupillometry results were blinded to clinicians involved in patient care. Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) at 1 year was the outcome endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors (n=50 patients; 32 CPC 1, 16 CPC 2, 2 CPC 3) had higher quantitative PLR (median 20 [range 13-41] vs. 11 [0-55] %, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and constriction velocity (1.46 [0.85-4.63] vs. 0.94 [0.16-4.97] mm/sec, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) than non-survivors. At 48 hours, a quantitative PLR &amp;lt;13% had 100% specificity and positive predictive value to predict poor recovery (0% false-positive rate), and provided equal performance than that of EEG and SSEP. Reduced quantitative PLR correlated with higher serum neuron specific enolase (Spearman's &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; -0.52, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced quantitative PLR correlates with post-anoxic brain injury and, when compared to standard multimodal assessment, is highly accurate in predicting long-term prognosis after CA. This is the first prognostication study to show the value of automated pupillometry using a blinded approach to minimize self-fulfilling prophecy. This article is protected by copyright.

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of adaptive immunity provides enhanced defence against specific pathogens, as well as homeostatic immune surveillance of all tissues. Despite being 'immune privileged', the CNS uses the assistance of the immune system in physiological and pathological states. In this Opinion article, we discuss the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is present at high levels in all neurons and their synapses. We now learn that this protein helps dilate the fusion pore, which forms transiently during vesicle exocytosis, promoting release of certain neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capillary endothelial cells sense neuronal activity-evoked increases in extracellular K+ via KIR2.1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The ensuing hyperpolarization travels upstream along the vascular network, reaching arterioles and evoking vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author: Natasha Bray&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of rats manipulating the frequency of a tone exhibit 'frequency fields', akin to place fields seen during spatial navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery that heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the gene encoding progranulin are causally linked to frontotemporal dementia and lysosomal storage disease, respectively, reveals previously unrecognized roles of the progranulin protein in regulating lysosome biogenesis and function. Given the importance of lysosomes in cellular homeostasis, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new studies provide new tools for examining mechanisms of plasticity in dendrites. Tang and Yasuda developed new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase A (PKA), which are implicated in synaptic plasticity, primarily by replacing the fluorophore &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult. Yu et al. found that they could socially transmit scratching to mice by allowing them to watch mice with chronic itch. The observer mice showed upregulated neuronal activity &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axonal injuries can trigger a process of axonal disintegration known as Wallerian degeneration, which is thought to be largely driven by intrinsic mechanisms in the axon. Here, knocking out the death receptor 6 (Dr6) gene in cultured mouse sympathetic or dorsal root ganglion &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>
