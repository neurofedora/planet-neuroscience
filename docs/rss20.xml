	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On identifying collective displacements in apo-proteins that reveal eventual binding pathways</title>

Binding of small molecules to proteins often involves large conformational changes in the latter, which open up pathways to the binding site. Observing and pinpointing these rare events in large scale, all-atom, computations of specific protein-ligand complexes, is expensive and to a great extent serendipitous. Further, relevant collective variables which characterise specific binding or un-binding scenarios are still difficult to identify despite the large body of work on the subject. Here, we show that possible primary and secondary binding pathways can be discovered from short simulations of the apo-protein without waiting for an actual binding event to occur. We use a projection formalism, introduced earlier to study deformation in solids, to analyse local atomic displacements into two mutually orthogonal subspaces—those which are “affine” i.e. expressible as a homogeneous deformation of the native structure, and those which are not. The susceptibility to non-affine displacements among the various residues in the apo- protein is then shown to correlate with typical binding pathways and sites crucial for allosteric modifications. We validate our observation with all-atom computations of three proteins, T4-Lysozyme, Src kinase and Cytochrome P450.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DUt8CyJ4OU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The finite state projection based Fisher information matrix approach to estimate information and optimize single-cell experiments</title>

Modern optical imaging experiments not only measure single-cell and single-molecule dynamics with high precision, but they can also perturb the cellular environment in myriad controlled and novel settings. Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/quvKzmVx9vA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Genetic variation in the peptide-binding groove of the highly polymorphic HLA class I molecules has repeatedly been associated with HIV-1 control and progression to AIDS, accounting for up to 12% of the variation in HIV-1 set point viral load (spVL). This suggests a key role in disease control for HLA...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/O7EQPyHBXJU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Plastid genomes (plastomes) vary enormously in size and gene content among the many lineages of nonphotosynthetic plants, but key lineages remain unexplored. We therefore investigated plastome sequence and expression in the holoparasitic and morphologically bizarre Balanophoraceae. The two Balanophora plastomes examined are remarkable, exhibiting features rarely if ever seen before...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/XD3tJhSTUDw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Fabian Rentzsch, Celina Juliano, Brigitte Galliot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cnidarians shared a common ancestor with bilaterians more than 600 million years ago. This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How to correctly quantify neuronal phase-response curves from noisy recordings. (arXiv:1901.04399v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04399</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04399</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At the level of individual neurons, various coding properties can be inferred
from the input-output relationship of a cell. For small inputs, this relation
is captured by the phase-response curve (PRC), which measures the effect of a
small perturbation on the timing of the subsequent spike. Experimentally,
however, an accurate experimental estimation of PRCs is challenging. Despite
elaborate measurement efforts, experimental PRC estimates often cannot be
related to those from modeling studies. In particular, experimental PRCs rarely
resemble the generic PRC expected close to spike initiation, which is
indicative of the underlying spike-onset bifurcation. Here, we show for
conductance-based model neurons that the correspondence between theoretical and
measured phase-response curve is lost when the stimuli used for the estimation
are too large. In this case, the derived phase-response curve is distorted
beyond recognition and takes on a generic shape that reflects the measurement
protocol, but not the real neuronal dynamics. We discuss how to identify
appropriate stimulus strengths for perturbation and noise-stimulation methods,
which permit to estimate PRCs that reliably reflect the spike-onset bifurcation
-- a task that is particularly difficult if a lower bound for the stimulus
amplitude is dictated by prominent intrinsic neuronal noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal decoding of dynamic stimuli encoded by heterogeneous populations of spiking neurons - a closed form approximation. (arXiv:1901.04094v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04094</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04094</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural decoding may be formulated as dynamic state estimation (filtering)
based on point process observations, a generally intractable problem. Numerical
sampling techniques are often practically useful for the decoding of real
neural data. However, they are less useful as theoretical tools for modeling
and understanding sensory neural systems, since they lead to limited conceptual
insight about optimal encoding and decoding strategies. We consider sensory
neural populations characterized by a distribution over neuron parameters. We
develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering
based on the observation of spiking activity, that greatly facilitates the
analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of
uniform coding. Continuous distributions are used to approximate large
populations with few parameters, resulting in a filter whose complexity does
not grow with the population size, and allowing optimization of population
parameters rather than individual tuning functions. Numerical comparison with
particle filtering demonstrates the quality of the approximation. The analytic
framework leads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical
algorithms, and is consistent with biological observations about the
distribution of sensory cells' preferred stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human listeners need to permanently interact with their three-dimensional
(3-D) environment. To this end, they require efficient perceptual mechanisms to
form a sufficiently accurate 3-D auditory space. In this chapter, we discuss
the formation of the 3-D auditory space from various perspectives. The aim is
to show the link between cognition, acoustics, neurophysiology, and
psychophysics, when it comes to spatial hearing. First, we present recent
cognitive concepts for creating internal models of the complex auditory
environment. Second, we describe the acoustic signals available at our ears and
discuss the spatial information they convey. Third, we look into
neurophysiology, seeking for the neural substrates of the 3-D auditory space.
Finally, we elaborate on psychophysical spatial tasks and percepts that are
possible just because of the formation of the auditory space.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Convergent recruitment of TALE homeodomain life cycle regulators to direct sporophyte development in land plants and brown algae</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43101</guid>

	<description>Three amino acid loop extension homeodomain transcription factors (TALE HD TFs) act as life cycle regulators in green algae and land plants. In mosses these regulators are required for the deployment of the sporophyte developmental program. We demonstrate that mutations in either of two TALE HD TF genes, &lt;i&gt;OUROBOROS&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;SAMSARA&lt;/i&gt;, in the brown alga &lt;i&gt;Ectocarpus&lt;/i&gt; result in conversion of the sporophyte generation into a gametophyte. The OUROBOROS and SAMSARA proteins heterodimerise in a similar manner to TALE HD TF life cycle regulators in the green lineage. These observations demonstrate that TALE-HD-TF-based life cycle regulation systems have an extremely ancient origin, and that these systems have been independently recruited to regulate sporophyte developmental programs in at least two different complex multicellular eukaryotic supergroups, Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Molecular basis of wax-based color change and UV reflection in                    dragonflies</title>

	<description>Many animals change their body color for visual signaling and environmental                    adaptation. Some dragonflies show wax-based color change and ultraviolet (UV)                    reflection, but biochemical properties underlying the phenomena are totally                    unknown. Here we investigated the UV-reflective abdominal wax of dragonflies,                    thereby identifying very long-chain methyl ketones and aldehydes as unique and                    major wax components. Although little wax was detected on young adults, dense                    wax secretion was mainly found on the dorsal abdomen in mature males of                        &lt;i&gt;Orthetrum albistylum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;O. melania&lt;/i&gt;, while                    pruinose wax secretion was identified on the ventral abdomen in mature females                    of &lt;i&gt;O. albistylum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sympetrum darwinianum&lt;/i&gt;.                    Comparative transcriptomics demonstrated drastic upregulation of                        &lt;i&gt;ELOVL17&lt;/i&gt; gene, a member of the fatty acid elongase family,                    whose expression reflected the distribution of very long-chain methyl ketones.                    Synthetic 2-pentacosanone, the major component of dragonfly's wax, spontaneously                    formed light-scattering scale-like fine structures with strong UV reflection,                    suggesting its potential utility for biomimetics.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Conserved allosteric pathways for activation of TRPV3 revealed through engineering vanilloid-sensitivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42756</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42756</link>
	<description>The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV) channel is activated by an array of stimuli, including heat and vanilloid compounds. The TRPV1 homologues TRPV2 and TRPV3 are also activated by heat, but sensitivity to vanilloids and many other agonists is not conserved among TRPV subfamily members. It was recently discovered that four mutations in TRPV2 are sufficient to render the channel sensitive to the TRPV1-specific vanilloid agonist resiniferatoxin (RTx). Here, we show that mutation of six residues in TRPV3 corresponding to the vanilloid site in TRPV1 is sufficient to engineer RTx binding. However, robust activation of TRPV3 by RTx requires facilitation of channel opening by introducing mutations in the pore, temperatures &amp;gt; 30°C, or sensitization with another agonist. Our results demonstrate that the energetics of channel activation can determine the apparent sensitivity to a stimulus and suggest that allosteric pathways for activation are conserved in the TRPV family.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: GREB1 amplifies androgen receptor output in human prostate cancer and contributes to antiandrogen resistance</title>

	<description>Genomic amplification of the androgen receptor (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) is an established mechanism of antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer. Here we show that the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; signaling output, independent of &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; genomic alteration or expression level, also contributes to antiandrogen resistance, through upregulation of the coactivator &lt;i&gt;GREB1&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate 100-fold heterogeneity in &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; output within human prostate cancer cell lines and show that cells with high &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; output have reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Through transcriptomic and shRNA knockdown studies, together with analysis of clinical datasets, we identify &lt;i&gt;GREB1&lt;/i&gt; as a gene responsible for high &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; output. We show that &lt;i&gt;GREB1&lt;/i&gt; is an &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; target gene that amplifies &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; output by enhancing &lt;i&gt;AR &lt;/i&gt;DNA binding and promoting &lt;i&gt;EP300&lt;/i&gt; recruitment. &lt;i&gt;GREB1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in high &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; output cells restores enzalutamide sensitivity in vivo. Thus, &lt;i&gt;GREB1&lt;/i&gt; is a candidate driver of enzalutamide resistance through a novel feed forward mechanism.</description>

	<description>Animals respond to mitochondrial stress with the induction of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;mt&lt;/sup&gt;). A cascade of events occurs upon UPR&lt;sup&gt;mt&lt;/sup&gt; activation, ultimately triggering a transcriptional response governed by two transcription factors: DVE-1 and ATFS-1. Here we identify SUMO-specific peptidase ULP-4 as a positive regulator of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; UPR&lt;sup&gt;mt&lt;/sup&gt; to control SUMOylation status of DVE-1 and ATFS-1. SUMOylation affects these two axes in the transcriptional program of UPR&lt;sup&gt;mt&lt;/sup&gt; with distinct mechanisms: change of DVE-1 subcellular localization vs. change of ATFS-1 stability and activity. Our findings reveal a post-translational modification that promotes immune response and lifespan extension during mitochondrial stress.</description>

	<description>DUX4 is a transcription factor whose misexpression in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). While DUX4's transcriptional activity has been extensively characterized, the DUX4-induced proteome remains undescribed. Here, we report concurrent measurement of RNA and protein levels in DUX4-expressing cells via RNA-seq and quantitative mass spectrometry. DUX4 transcriptional targets were robustly translated, confirming the likely clinical relevance of proposed FSHD biomarkers. However, a multitude of mRNAs and proteins exhibited discordant expression changes upon DUX4 expression. Our dataset revealed unexpected proteomic, but not transcriptomic, dysregulation of diverse molecular pathways, including Golgi apparatus fragmentation, as well as extensive post-transcriptional buffering of stress response genes. Key components of RNA degradation machineries, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1, exhibited suppressed protein, but not mRNA, levels, explaining the build-up of aberrant RNAs that characterizes DUX4-expressing cells. Our results provide a resource for the FSHD community and illustrate the importance of post-transcriptional processes to DUX4-induced pathology.</description>

	<description>Understanding the relationships between different properties of data, such as whether a genome or connectome has information about disease status, is increasingly important. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they may require unfeasibly large sample sizes and often are not interpretable. Our approach, 'Multiscale Graph Correlation' (MGC), is a dependence test that juxtaposes disparate data science techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods, and multiscale analysis. Other methods may require double or triple the number of samples to achieve the same statistical power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to 1000. Moreover, MGC uniquely characterizes the latent geometry underlying the relationship, while maintaining computational efficiency. In real data, including brain imaging and cancer genetics, MGC detects the presence of a dependency and provides guidance for the next experiments to conduct.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Programmed knockout mutation of liver fluke granulin attenuates virulence of infection-induced hepatobiliary morbidity</title>

	<description>Infection with the food-borne liver fluke &lt;i&gt;Opisthorchis viverrini &lt;/i&gt;is the principal risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Lower Mekong River Basin countries including Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia. We exploited this link to explore the role of the secreted growth factor termed liver fluke granulin (&lt;i&gt;Ov&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;grn-1&lt;/i&gt;) in pre-malignant lesions by undertaking programmed knockout of the&lt;i&gt; Ov&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;grn-1&lt;/i&gt; gene from the liver fluke genome. Deep sequencing of amplicon libraries from genomic DNA of gene-edited parasites revealed Cas9-catalyzed mutations within &lt;i&gt;Ov&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;grn-1&lt;/i&gt;. Gene editing resulted in rapid depletion of &lt;i&gt;Ov-grn-1&lt;/i&gt; transcripts and the encoded &lt;i&gt;Ov&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;grn-1&lt;/i&gt; protein. Gene-edited parasites colonized the biliary tract of hamsters and developed into adult flukes, but the infection resulted in reduced pathology as evidenced by attenuated biliary hyperplasia and fibrosis. Not only does this report pioneer programmed gene-editing in parasitic flatworms, but the striking, clinically-relevant pathophysiological phenotype confirms the role for &lt;i&gt;Ov-grn-1&lt;/i&gt; in virulence morbidity during opisthorchiasis.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Programmed genome editing of the omega-1 ribonuclease of the blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni </title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41337</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41337</link>
	<description>CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has yet to be reported in species of the Platyhelminthes. We tested this approach by targeting omega-1 (ω1) of &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt; as a proof of principle. This secreted ribonuclease is crucial for Th2 polarization and granuloma formation. Schistosome eggs were exposed to Cas9 complexed with guide RNA complementary to ω1 by electroporation or by transduction with lentiviral particles. Some eggs were also transfected with a single stranded donor template. Sequences of amplicons from gene-edited parasites exhibited Cas9-catalyzed mutations including homology directed repaired alleles, and other analyses revealed depletion of ω1 transcripts and the ribonuclease. Gene-edited eggs failed to polarize Th2 cytokine responses in macrophage/T-cell co-cultures, while the volume of pulmonary granulomas surrounding ω1-mutated eggs following tail-vein injection into mice was vastly reduced. Knock-out of ω1 and the diminished levels of these cytokines following exposure showcase the novel application of programmed gene editing for functional genomics in schistosomes.</description>

	<description>Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons induces widespread cellular and transcriptional reconfiguration. Here, we characterized global epigenomic changes during the direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neurons using whole-genome base-resolution DNA methylation (mC) sequencing. We found that the pioneer transcription factor Ascl1 alone is sufficient for inducing the uniquely neuronal feature of non-CG methylation (mCH), but co-expression of Brn2 and Mytl1 was required to establish a global mCH pattern reminiscent of mature cortical neurons. Ascl1 alone induced promoter CG methylation (mCG) of fibroblast specific genes, while BAM overexpression additionally targets a competing myogenic program and directs a more faithful conversion to neuronal cells. Ascl1 induces local demethylation at its binding sites. Surprisingly, co-expression with Brn2 and Mytl1 inhibited the ability of Ascl1 to induce demethylation, suggesting a contextual regulation of transcription factor - epigenome interaction. Finally, we found that de novo methylation by DNMT3A is required for efficient neuronal reprogramming.</description>

	<description>We use a genome-wide association of 1 million parental lifespans of genotyped subjects and data on mortality risk factors to validate previously unreplicated findings near &lt;i&gt;CDKN2B-AS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN2/BRAP&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FURIN/FES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ZW10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PSORS1C3&lt;/i&gt;, and 13q21.31, and identify and replicate novel findings near &lt;i&gt;ABO&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ZC3HC1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IGF2R&lt;/i&gt;. We also validate previous findings near 5q33.3/&lt;i&gt;EBF1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXO3&lt;/i&gt;, whilst finding contradictory evidence at other loci. Gene set and cell-specific analyses show that expression in foetal brain cells and adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is enriched for lifespan variation, as are gene pathways involving lipid proteins and homeostasis, vesicle-mediated transport, and synaptic function. Individual genetic variants that increase dementia, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer – but not other cancers – explain the most variance. Resulting polygenic scores show a mean lifespan difference of around five years of life across the deciles.</description>

	<description>Tissue mechanics is important for development; however, the spatio-temporal dynamics of in vivo tissue stiffness is still poorly understood. We here developed tiv-AFM, combining time-lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy with upright fluorescence imaging of embryonic tissue, to show that during development local tissue stiffness changes significantly within tens of minutes. Within this time frame, a stiffness gradient arose in the developing &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; brain, and retinal ganglion cell axons turned to follow this gradient. Changes in local tissue stiffness were largely governed by cell proliferation, as perturbation of mitosis diminished both the stiffness gradient and the caudal turn of axons found in control brains. Hence, we identified a close relationship between the dynamics of tissue mechanics and developmental processes, underpinning the importance of time-resolved stiffness measurements.</description>

	<description>Using the critical Ising model of the brain, integrated information as a measure of consciousness is measured in toy models of generic neural networks. Monte Carlo simulations are run on 159 random weighted networks analogous to small 5 node neural network motifs. The integrated information generated by this sample of small Ising models is measured across the model parameter space. It is observed that integrated information, as a type of order parameter not unlike a concept like magnetism, undergoes a phase transition at the critical point in the model. This critical point is demarcated by the peaks of the generalized susceptibility of integrated information, a point where the `consciousness' of the system is maximally susceptible to perturbations and on the boundary between an ordered and disordered form. This study adds further evidence to support that the emergence of consciousness coincides with the more universal patterns of self-organized criticality, evolution, the emergence of complexity, and the integration of complex systems.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Binding of Filamentous Actin to CaMKII as a Potential Mechanism for the Regulation of Bidirectional Synaptic Plasticity by betaCaMKII in Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/521542v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates many forms of synaptic plasticity, but little is known about its functional role during plasticity induction in the cerebellum. Experiments have indicated that the beta isoform of CaMKII controls the bidirectional inversion of plasticity at parallel fibre (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in cerebellar cortex. Because the cellular events that underlie these experimental findings are still poorly understood, we developed a simple computational model to investigate how betaCaMKII regulates the direction of plasticity in cerebellar PCs. We present the first model of AMPA receptor phosphorylation that simulates the induction of long-term depression (LTD) and potentiation (LTP) at the PF-PC synapse. Our simulation results suggest that the balance of CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B)-mediated dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors can determine whether LTD or LTP occurs in cerebellar PCs. The model replicates experimental observations that indicate that betaCaMKII controls the direction of plasticity at PF-PC synapses, and demonstrates that the binding of filamentous actin to CaMKII can enable the beta isoform of the kinase to regulate bidirectional plasticity at these synapses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Involvement of gestational weight and body composition on autonomic recovery following aerobic exercise in children: a prospective, observational and analytical study</title>

	<description>Birth weight (BW) can be used to assess the health status of the newborn. However, its impacts on later in life regarding heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) is not totally clear. We aimed to analyze the involvement of BW and body composition on HRV recovery following aerobic exercise in children. The study was conducted in healthy children 9 to 11 years of age (40 females and 27 males) divided into two groups: G1 (BW &amp;lt; 3400 grams, N = 33) and G2 (BW &amp;gt; 3400 grams, N = 34). The volunteers completed an experimental protocol of submaximal aerobic exercise on a treadmill and remained seated for 30 minutes after exercise. Systolic (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), respiratory rate (f) and HRV were analyzed before and during recovery from exercise. SAP and f were significantly decreased 30 minutes after exercise compared to 1 minute after exercise in G1 and G2. Mean HR, high frequency band of spectral analysis (HF) , root mean square of successive interbeat intervals difference, SD1 index and mean lenght were diminished 0 to 5 minutes after exercise compared to rest in G2 while maximum lenght increased 0 to 5 minutes after exercise compared to resting in G2. Linear regression revealed association of fat percentage and BW with nonlinear HRV recovery. In conclusion, autonomic recovery after exercise was somewhat delayed in children with high BW. BW and fat percentage slightly influence HRV recovery.</description>

	<description>The human retina contains three classes of cone photoreceptors each sensitive to different portions of the visual spectrum: long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelengths. Color information is computed by downstream neurons that compare relative activity across the three cone types. How cone signals are combined at a cellular scale has been more difficult to resolve. This is especially true near the fovea, where spectrally-opponent neurons in the parvocellular pathway draw excitatory input from a single cone and thus even the smallest stimulus will engage multiple color-signaling neurons. We used an adaptive optics microstimulator to target individual and pairs of cones with light. Consistent with prior work, we found that color percepts elicited from individual cones were predicted by their spectral sensitivity, although there was considerable variability even between cones within the same spectral class. The appearance of spots targeted at two cones were predicted by an average of their individual activations. However, two cones of the same subclass elicited percepts that were systematically more saturated than predicted by an average. Together, these observations suggest both spectral opponency and prior experience influence the appearance of small spots.</description>

	<description>When facing fully ambiguous images, the brain cannot commit to a single percept and instead switches between mutually exclusive interpretations every few seconds, a phenomenon known as bistable perception. Despite years of research, there is still no consensus on whether bistability, and perception in general, is driven primarily by bottom-up or top-down mechanisms. Here, we adopted a Bayesian approach in an effort to reconcile these two theories. Fifty-five healthy participants were exposed to an adaptation of the Necker cube paradigm, in which we manipulated sensory evidence (by shadowing the cube) and prior knowledge (e.g., by varying instructions about what participants should expect to see). We found that manipulations of both sensory evidence and priors significantly affected the way participants perceived the Necker cube. However, we observed an interaction between the effect of the cue and the effect of the instructions, a finding incompatible with Bayes-optimal integration. In contrast, the data were well predicted by a circular inference model. In this model, ambiguous sensory evidence is systematically biased in the direction of current expectations, ultimately resulting in a bistable percept.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Drosophila ERG channel seizure plays a role in the neuronal homeostatic stress response</title>

	<description>Neuronal physiology is particularly sensitive to acute stressors that affect excitability, many of which can trigger seizures and epilepsies. Although intrinsic neuronal homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining overall nervous system robustness and its resistance to stressors, the specific genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not well understood. Here we used a reverse genetic approach in Drosophila to test the hypothesis that specific voltage-gated ion channels contribute to neuronal homeostasis, robustness, and stress resistance. We found that the activity of the voltage-gated potassium channel seizure (sei), an ortholog of the mammalian ERG channel family, is essential for protecting flies from acute heat-induced seizures. Although sei is broadly expressed in the nervous system, our data indicate that its impact on the organismal robustness to acute environmental stress is primarily mediated via its action in excitatory neurons, the octopaminergic system, as well as glia. Furthermore, our studies suggest that human mutations in the human ERG channel (hERG), which have been primarily implicated in the cardiac Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), may also contribute to the high incidence of seizures in LQTS patients via a cardiovascular-independent neurogenic pathway.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: NMDAR-activated PP1 dephosphorylates GluN2B to modulate NMDAR plasticity.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520882v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520882v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In mature neurons, postsynaptic NMDARs are segregated in two populations, synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs, which differ in localization, function and associated intracellular cascades. These two pools are connected via lateral diffusion, and receptor exchange between them modulates synaptic NMDAR content (NMDAR-plasticity). Here, we identify the phosphorylation of the PDZ-ligand of the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs (at S1480) as a critical determinant in dynamically controlling NMDAR subsynaptic localization. We find that this phosphorylation maintains NMDARs segregated at extrasynaptic membranes as part of a protein complex containing inactive Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1). Global (synaptic and extrasynaptic) activation of NMDARs lead to the activation of PP1, which mediates dephosphorylation of GluN2B at S1480 and promotes an increase in synaptic NMDAR content. Thus, PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of the PDZ-ligand of GluN2B contributes to NMDAR-plasticity regulation, a process with profound consequences for synaptic and structural plasticity, metaplasticity, and synaptic neurotransmission.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Nucleus accumbens cholinergic interneurons oppose cue-motivated behavior</title>

	<description>Environmental reward-predictive stimuli provide a major source of motivation for adaptive reward pursuit behavior. This cue-motivated behavior is known to be mediated by the nucleus accumbens core (NAc). The cholinergic interneurons in the NAc are tonically active and densely arborized and, thus, well-suited to modulate NAc function. But their causal contribution to adaptive behavior remains unknown. Here we investigated the function of NAc cholinergic interneurons in cue-motivated behavior. To do this, we used chemogenetics, optogenetics, pharmacology, and a translationally analogous Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer behavioral task designed to assess the motivating influence of a reward-predictive cue over reward-seeking actions in male and female rats. The data show that NAc cholinergic interneuron activity is necessary and sufficient to oppose the motivating influence of appetitive cues. Chemogenetic inhibition of NAc cholinergic interneurons augmented cue-motivated behavior. Optical stimulation of acetylcholine release from NAc cholinergic interneurons prevented cues from invigorating reward-seeking behavior, an effect that was mediated by activation of {beta}2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Thus, NAc cholinergic interneurons provide a critical regulatory influence over adaptive cue-motivated behavior and, therefore, are a potential therapeutic target for the maladaptive cue-motivated behavior that marks many psychiatric conditions, including addiction and depression.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: SGK1.1 activation causes early seizure termination via effects on M-current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520775v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520775v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Early termination of status epilepticus affords protection against brain damage and associated pathologies. Regulation of Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channels, underlying the neuronal M-current, is key for seizure control. This conductance is maintained during initiation of action potentials, affecting neuronal excitability and thus inhibiting epileptic discharges. The M-current is upregulated by the neuronal isoform of the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase SGK1 (SGK1.1). We tested whether SGK1.1 is an anticonvulsant factor using the kainic acid (KA) model of acute seizures in a transgenic mouse model with expression of a constitutively active form of the kinase. Our results demonstrate that SGK1.1 confers robust protection against seizures associated to lower mortality levels, independently of sex or genetic background. SGK1.1-dependent protection results in reduced number, shorter duration, and early termination of EEG seizures. At the cellular level, it is associated to increased M-current amplitude mediated by Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, leading to decreased excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons without alteration of basal synaptic transmission. Altogether, our results reveal that SGK1.1-mediated M-current upregulation in the hippocampus is a key component of seizure resistance in the KA epileptic paradigm, suggesting that regulation of this anticonvulsant pathway may improve adverse outcomes to status epilepticus, constituting a potential target for antiepileptic drugs.</description>

	<description>Optic ataxia is a neurological condition that shows clinical manifestations of disturbances in visual guided hand movements on reaching for a target object. Previous studies failed to provide substantial evidences for the neural structural pathway damaged by this condition. Therefore, this study was aimed to identify the neural structural connectivity between Visual cortex with Superior Parietal Lobule and to correlate its functional importance, using Diffusion Imaging fiber Tractography. The fibers were traced, and we confirmed its extension from Visual cortex (Brodmann Areas 18 and 19) to Superior Parietal Lobule (Brodmann Area 7). This new observation gives an insight to understand the structural existence and functional correlations between Visual cortex with Superior Parietal Lobule which is involved in targeting the grasping hand movements towards a visually perceived object, called visuo motor coordination pathway or how stream pathways in visual perception. The observational analysis used thirty two healthy adults, ultra-high b-value, diffusion MRI datasets from an Open access research platform. The datasets range between 20 to 49 years, in both sexes, with mean age of 31.1 years. The confirmatory observational analysis process includes, datasets acquisition, preprocessing, processing, reconstruction, fiber tractography and analysis using software tools. All the datasets confirmed that the fiber structural extension between, Visual cortex to superior parietal lobe in both the sexes may be responsible for the visual spatial recognition of objects. These new fiber connectivity evidences justify the structural relevance of visual spatial recognition impairments, such as optic ataxia. Keywords: DTI Tractography, Dorsal stream visual pathway, Superior Parietal Lobule, Where stream Visual pathways, How stream visual pathway.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Coherent coding of spatial position mediated by theta oscillations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520585v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520585v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Interactions between the hippocampus (area CA1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are crucial for memory-guided behavior. Theta oscillations (~8 Hz) underlie a key physiological mechanism for mediating these coordinated interactions, and theta oscillatory coherence and phase-locked spiking in the two regions have been shown to be important for spatial memory. Hippocampal place cell activity associated with theta oscillations encodes spatial position during behavior, and theta-phase associated spiking is known to further mediate a temporal code for space within CA1 place fields. Although prefrontal neurons are prominently phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations in spatial memory tasks, whether and how theta oscillations mediate processing of spatial information across these networks remains unclear. Here, we addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of dorsal CA1-PFC ensembles and population decoding analyses in male rats performing a continuous spatial working memory task known to require hippocampal-prefrontal interactions. We found that in addition to CA1, population activity in PFC can also encode the animal's current spatial position on a theta-cycle timescale during memory-guided behavior. Coding of spatial position was coherent for CA1 and PFC ensembles, exhibiting correlated position representations within theta cycles. In addition, incorporating theta-phase information during decoding to account for theta-phase associated spiking resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of prefrontal spatial representations, similar to concurrent CA1 representations. These findings indicate a theta-oscillation mediated mechanism of temporal coordination for shared processing and communication of spatial information across the two networks during spatial memory-guided behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuropathological validation of the MDS-PSP criteria with PSP and other frontotemporal lobar degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520510v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520510v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is clinically heterogeneous. Clinical diagnostic criteria were revised in 2017, to increase sensitivity and operationalize the diagnosis of PSP Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) and 'variant' syndromes (vPSP). Objectives: To determine the (1) sensitivity and specificity of the 1996 NINDS-SPSP and 2017 MDS-PSP criteria; (2) false positive rates in frontotemporal dementia with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); and (3) clinical evolution of variant PSP syndromes (vPSP). Methods: Retrospective multicenter review of 108 neuropathologically-confirmed PSP patients and 81 patients with other forms of FTLD: 38 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 14 non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and 29 corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Sensitivity and specificity of the MDS-PSP criteria were compared to the NINDS-SPSP criteria at baseline. In a subset of cases, the timing and frequency of clinical features were compared across groups over six years. Results: Sensitivity for recognition of probable and possible PSP pathology was higher by MDS-PSP criteria (72.2-100%) than NINDS-SPSP criteria (48.1-61.1%). Specificity was higher by NINDS-SPSP criteria (97.5-100%) than MDS-PSP criteria (53.1-95.1%). False positives by MDS-PSP criteria were few for bvFTD (10.5-18.4%) but common for CBD and nfvPPA (fulfilling 'suggestive of' PSP). Most vPSP cases developed PSP-RS-like features within six years, including falls and supranuclear gaze palsy, distinguishing frontal presentations of PSP from bvFTD, and speech/language presentations of PSP from nfvPPA. Conclusions: The 2017 MDS-PSP criteria successfully identify PSP, including variant phenotypes. This independent validation of the revised clinical diagnostic criteria strengthens the case for novel therapeutic strategies against PSP to include variant presentations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions revisited</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520502v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In our previous paper (Bijsterbosch et al., 2018), we showed that network-based modelling of brain connectivity interacts strongly with the shape and exact location of brain regions, such that cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Here we show that these spatial effects on connectivity estimates actually occur as a result of spatial overlap between brain networks. This is shown to systematically bias connectivity estimates obtained from group spatial ICA followed by dual regression. We introduce an extended method that addresses the bias and achieves more accurate connectivity estimates.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520395v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Whether and how the balance between plasticity and stability varies across the brain is an important open question. Within a processing hierarchy, it is thought that plasticity is increased at higher levels of cortical processing, but direct quantitative comparisons between low- and high-level plasticity have not been made so far. Here, we addressed this issue for the human cortical visual system. By quantifying plasticity as the complement of the heritability of functional connectivity, we demonstrate a non-monotonic relationship between plasticity and hierarchical level, such that plasticity decreases from early to mid-level cortex, and then increases further of the visual hierarchy. This non-monotonic relationship argues against recent theory that the balance between plasticity and stability is governed by the costs of the &quot;coding- catastrophe&quot;, and can be explained by a concurrent decline of short-term adaptation and rise of long-term plasticity up the visual processing hierarchy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Identification of Physiological Response Functions to Correct for Fluctuations in Resting-State fMRI related to Heart Rate and Respiration</title>

	<description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely viewed as the gold standard for studying brain function due to its high spatial resolution and non-invasive nature. However, it is well established that changes in breathing patterns and heart rate influence strongly the BOLD fMRI signal and this, in turn, can have considerable effects on fMRI studies, particularly resting-state studies. The effects of physiological processes are often quantified by using convolutional models along with simultaneously recorded physiological data. In this context, physiological response function (PRF) curves (cardiac and respiratory response functions), which are convolved with the corresponding physiological fluctuations, are commonly employed. Initially, these PRF curves were assumed to be identical across subjects, but more recently, the use of subject-specific PRF curves has been suggested (derived by e.g. using the global fMRI signal). In the present study, we propose a novel framework for the robust estimation of PRF curves and use this framework to rigorously examine the implications of using population-, subject-, session- and scan-specific PRF curves. The proposed framework was tested on resting-state fMRI and physiological data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results suggest that PRF curves vary significantly across subjects and, to a lesser extent, across sessions from the same subject. These differences can be partly attributed to physiological variables such as the mean and variance of the heart rate during the scan. The proposed method can be used to obtain robust scan-specific PRF curves from data records with duration longer than 5 minutes, exhibiting significantly improved performance compared to previously defined canonical cardiac and respiration response functions. Besides removing physiological confounds from the BOLD signal, accurate modeling of subject- (or session-/scan-) specific PRF curves is of importance in studies that involve populations with altered vascular responses, such as aging subjects.</description>

Metabolomics is a powerful approach for discovering biomarkers and for characterizing the biochemical consequences of genetic variation. While untargeted metabolite profiling can measure thousands of signals in a single experiment, many biologically meaningful signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites nor compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To overcome these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets and to generate metabolic pathway annotations for these signals. To pair up signals measured in different datasets, where retention times (RT) are often not comparable or even available, we implemented an imputation-based approach that only requires mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). As validation, we treated each shared known metabolite as an unmatched signal and showed that PAIRUP-MS correctly matched 70–88% of these metabolites from among thousands of signals, equaling or outperforming a standard m/z- and RT-based approach. We performed further validation using genetic data: the most stringent set of matched signals and shared knowns showed comparable consistency of genetic associations across datasets. Next, we developed a pathway reconstitution method to annotate unknown signals using curated metabolic pathways containing known metabolites. We performed genetic validation for the generated annotations, showing that annotated signals associated with gene variants were more likely to be enriched for pathways functionally related to the genes compared to random expectation. Finally, we applied PAIRUP-MS to study associations between metabolites and genetic variants or body mass index (BMI) across multiple datasets, identifying up to ~6 times more significant signals and many more BMI-associated pathways compared to the standard practice of only analyzing known metabolites. These results demonstrate that PAIRUP-MS enables analysis of unknown signals in a robust, biologically meaningful manner and provides a path to more comprehensive, well-powered studies of untargeted metabolomics data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsKjvnq3E10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The mental contents of perception and imagery are thought to be encoded in hierarchical representations in the brain, but previous attempts to visualize perceptual contents have failed to capitalize on multiple levels of the hierarchy, leaving it challenging to reconstruct internal imagery. Recent work showed that visual cortical activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be decoded (translated) into the hierarchical features of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features. Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that our method was able to reliably produce reconstructions that resembled the viewed natural images. A natural image prior introduced by a deep generator neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to the reconstructions. Human judgment of the reconstructions supported the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance the visual quality of generated images. While our model was solely trained with natural images, it successfully generalized to artificial shapes, indicating that our model was not simply matching to exemplars. The same analysis applied to mental imagery demonstrated rudimentary reconstructions of the subjective content. Our results suggest that our method can effectively combine hierarchical neural representations to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images, providing a new window into the internal contents of the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/egFhcN5PfJ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Memory of a recently eaten meal provides a lasting record of recent intake and limits subsequent ingestion; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these mnemonic effects remain unknown. Here, we show that optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons induced after the end of a sucrose, chow or saccharin meal, when the memory of the meal would be undergoing consolidation, accelerated the initiation of the next meal and, importantly, increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. These findings show that principal hippocampal neurons limit future intake and suggest that they do so by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cell-Type-Specific Changes in Intrinsic Excitability in the Subiculum following Learning and Exposure to Novel Environmental Contexts</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1 and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, although it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning (FC) and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells, but not BS cells, displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures [afterhyperpolarization (AHP), input resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt;), current required to elicit a spike], with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual FC followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type-specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: PINK1 Interacts with VCP/p97 and Activates PKA to Promote NSFL1C/p47 Phosphorylation and Dendritic Arborization in Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 [PKA&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;(pT197)], a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD; PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Longitudinal Changes in Semantic Concreteness in Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA)</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of gray matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (time 1 and time 2) in patients with svPPA (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) and bvFTD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03553</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03553</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we present DIVE: Data-driven Inference of Vertexwise Evolution. DIVE is
an image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution,
designed to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term
longitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise biomarker measurements on the
cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient
population, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex
measurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the
cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature
for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and
progression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing
stratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can
recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the
average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We
demonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing
patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's
disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects
in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct
patterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types
of biomarker data: cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs
amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Finally, DIVE can be used
to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using
any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression
maps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET
measures. DIVE source code is available online:

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) provide a direct communication link between
the brain and a computer or other external devices. They offer an extended
degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral
working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as
rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming and artificial
intelligence. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered
common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex
and nonlinear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification
challenges. Psycho-neurophysiological phenomena and their impact on brain
signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the
technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life. This review
summarizes progress in BCI field and highlights critical challenges.

	<description>Cell-cell communication via gap junctions regulates a wide range of physiological processes by enabling the direct intercellular electrical and chemical coupling. However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; distribution and function of gap junctions remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of non-invasive tools with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Here we developed PARIS (&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;airing &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;ctuators and &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;eceivers to optically &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;olate gap junctions), a new fully genetically encoded tool for measuring the cell-specific gap junctional coupling (GJC). PARIS successfully enabled monitoring of GJC in several cultured cell lines under physiologically relevant conditions and in distinct genetically defined neurons in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain, with ~10-sec temporal resolution and sub-cellular spatial resolution. These results demonstrate that PARIS is a robust, highly sensitive tool for mapping functional gap junctions and study their regulation in both health and disease.</description>

	<description>Negative-strand RNA viruses condense their genome into helical nucleocapsids that constitute essential templates for viral replication and transcription. The intrinsic flexibility of nucleocapsids usually prevents their full-length structural characterization at high resolution. Here we describe purification of full-length recombinant metastable helical nucleocapsid of Hantaan virus (&lt;i&gt;Hantaviridae &lt;/i&gt;family, &lt;i&gt;Bunyavirales&lt;/i&gt; order) and determine its structure at 3.3 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals the mechanisms of helical multimerization via sub-domain exchanges between protomers and highlights nucleotide positions in a continuous positively charged groove compatible with viral genome binding. It uncovers key sites for future structure-based design of antivirals that are currently lacking to counteract life-threatening hantavirus infections. The structure also suggests a model of nucleoprotein-polymerase interaction that would enable replication and transcription solely upon local disruption of the nucleocapsid.</description>

	<description>The secretion of peptides and proteins is essential for survival and ecological adaptation of bacteria. Dual-functional ATP-binding cassette transporters export antimicrobial or quorum signaling peptides in Gram-positive bacteria. Their substrates contain a leader sequence that is excised by an N-terminal peptidase C39 domain at a double Gly motif. We characterized the protease domain (LahT150) of a transporter from a lanthipeptide biosynthetic operon in Lachnospiraceae and demonstrate that this protease can remove the leader peptide from a diverse set of peptides. The 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of the protease domain in complex with a covalently bound leader peptide demonstrates the basis for substrate recognition across the entire class of such transporters. The structural data also provide a model for understanding the role of leader peptide recognition in the translocation cycle, and the function of degenerate, non-functional C39-like domains (CLD) in substrate recruitment in toxin exporters in Gram-negative bacteria.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The conserved aspartate ring of MCU mediates MICU1 binding and regulation in the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex</title>

	<description>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel that regulates intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis. It contains the pore-forming MCU protein, which possesses a DIME sequence thought to form a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity filter, and also regulatory EMRE, MICU1, and MICU2 subunits. To properly carry out physiological functions, the uniporter must stay closed in resting conditions, becoming open only when stimulated by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. This Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent activation, known to be mediated by MICU subunits, is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the DIME-aspartate mediates a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-modulated electrostatic interaction with MICU1, forming an MICU1 contact interface with a nearby Ser residue at the cytoplasmic entrance of the MCU pore. A mutagenesis screen of MICU1 identifies two highly-conserved Arg residues that might contact the DIME-Asp. Perturbing MCU-MICU1 interactions elicits unregulated, constitutive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux into mitochondria. These results indicate that MICU1 confers Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent gating of the uniporter by blocking/unblocking MCU.</description>

	<description>Development of vertebrate jaws involves patterning neural crest-derived mesenchyme cells into distinct subpopulations along the proximal-distal and oral-aboral axes. Although the molecular mechanisms patterning the proximal-distal axis have been well studied, little is known regarding the mechanisms patterning the oral-aboral axis. Using unbiased single-cell RNA-seq analysis followed by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; analysis of gene expression profiles, we show that Shh and Bmp4 signaling pathways are activated in a complementary pattern along the oral-aboral axis in mouse embryonic mandibular arch. Tissue-specific inactivation of hedgehog signaling in neural crest-derived mandibular mesenchyme led to expansion of BMP signaling activity to throughout the oral-aboral axis of the distal mandibular arch and subsequently duplication of dentary bone in the oral side of the mandible at the expense of tongue formation. Further studies indicate that hedgehog signaling acts through the Foxf1/2 transcription factors to specify the oral fate and pattern the oral-aboral axis of the mandibular mesenchyme.</description>

	<description>The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria serves as a selective permeability barrier that allows entry of essential nutrients while excluding toxic compounds, including antibiotics. The OM is asymmetric and contains an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or lipooligosaccharides (LOS) and an inner leaflet of glycerophospholipids (GPL). We screened &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; transposon mutants and identified a number of mutants with OM defects, including an ABC transporter system homologous to the Mla system in &lt;i&gt;E. coli. &lt;/i&gt;We further show that this opportunistic, antibiotic-resistant pathogen uses this multicomponent protein complex and ATP hydrolysis at the inner membrane to promote GPL export to the OM. The broad conservation of the Mla system in Gram-negative bacteria suggests the system may play a conserved role in OM biogenesis. The importance of the Mla system to &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; OM integrity and antibiotic sensitivity suggests that its components may serve as new antimicrobial therapeutic targets.</description>

	<description>Mutations frequently have outcomes that differ across individuals, even when these individuals are genetically identical and share a common environment. Moreover, individual microbial and mammalian cells can vary substantially in their proliferation rates, stress tolerance, and drug resistance, with important implications for the treatment of infections and cancer. To investigate the causes of cell-to-cell variation in proliferation, we used a high-throughput automated microscopy assay to quantify the impact of deleting &amp;gt;1,500 genes in yeast. Mutations affecting mitochondria were particularly variable in their outcome. In both mutant and wild-type cells mitochondrial membrane potential - but not amount - varied substantially across individual cells and predicted cell-to-cell variation in proliferation, mutation outcome, stress tolerance, and resistance in a clinically used anti-fungal drug. These results suggest an important role for cell-to-cell variation in the state of an organelle in single cell phenotypic variation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: RHO-1 and the Rho GEF RHGF-1 interact with UNC-6/Netrin signaling to regulate growth cone protrusion and microtubule organization in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/520262v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>UNC-6/Netrin is a conserved axon guidance cue that directs growth cone migrations in the dorsal-ventral axis of C. elegans and in the vertebrate spinal cord. UNC-6/Netrin is expressed in ventral cells, and growth cones migrate ventrally toward or dorsally away from UNC-6/Netrin. Recent studies of growth cone behavior during outgrowth in vivo in C. elegans have led to a polarity/protrusion model in directed growth cone migration away from UNC-6/Netrin. In this model, UNC-6/Netrin first polarizes the growth cone via the UNC-5 receptor, leading to dorsally biased protrusion and F-actin accumulation. UNC-6/Netrin then regulates protrusion based on this polarity. The receptor UNC-40/DCC drives protrusion dorsally, away from the UNC-6/Netrin source, and the UNC-5 receptor inhibits protrusion ventrally, near the UNC-6/Netrin source, resulting in dorsal migration. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion in part by excluding microtubules from the growth cone, which are pro-protrusive. Here we report that the RHO-1/RhoA GTPase and its activator GEF RHGF-1 inhibit growth cone protrusion and MT accumulation in growth cones, similar to UNC-5. However, growth cone polarity of protrusion and F-actin were unaffected by RHO-1 and RHGF-1. Thus, RHO-1 signaling acts specifically as a negative regulator of protrusion and MT accumulation, and not polarity. Genetic interactions suggest that RHO-1 and RHGF-1 act with UNC-5, as well as with a parallel pathway, to regulate protrusion. The cytoskeletal interacting molecule UNC-33/CRMP was required for RHO-1 activity to inhibit MT accumulation, suggesting that UNC-33/CRMP might act downstream of RHO-1. In sum, these studies describe a new role of RHO-1 and RHGF-1 in regulation of growth cone protrusion by UNC-6/Netrin.</description>

	<description>Anticipating meaningful actions in the environment is an essential function of the brain. Such predictive mechanisms originate from the motor system and allow for inferring actions from environmental affordances, the potential to act within a specific environment. Using architecture, we provide a unique perspective to the abiding debate in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy on whether cognition depends on movement or is decoupled from our physical structure. To investigate cognitive processes associated with architectural affordances, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach recording brain activity synchronized to head-mounted virtual reality. Participants perceived and acted upon virtual transitions ranging from non-passable to easily passable. We demonstrate that early sensory brain activity, upon revealing the environment and before actual movement, differed as a function of affordances. Additionally, movement through transitions was preceded by a motor-related negative component also depended on affordances.

	<description>The study of functional brain networks has grown rapidly over the past decade. While most functional connectivity (FC) analyses estimate one static network structure for the entire length of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, recently there has been increased interest in studying time-varying changes in FC. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be a useful modeling approach for discovering repeating graphs of interacting brain regions (brain states). However, a limitation lies in HMMs assuming that the sojourn time, the number of consecutive time points in a state, is geometrically distributed. This may encourage inaccurate estimation of the time spent in a state before switching to another state. We propose a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) approach for inferring time varying brain networks from fMRI data, which explicitly models the sojourn distribution. Specifically, we propose using HSMMs to find each subject's most probable series of network states and the graphs associated with each state, while properly estimating and modeling the sojourn distribution for each state. We perform a simulation study, as well as an analysis on both task-based fMRI data from an anxiety-inducing experiment and resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results demonstrate the importance of model choice when estimating sojourn times and reveal their potential for understanding healthy and diseased brain mechanisms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Resting multivoxel activity patterns in human visual cortex are linked to patterns evoked by preferred visual stimuli</title>

	<description>The relationship between spontaneous and task-evoked brain activity is an increasingly important topic in neuroscience. Here, we ask if spontaneous multivoxel activity patterns in human visual cortex are linked to patterns evoked by naturalistic (e.g. faces) and non-naturalistic (e.g. phase-scrambled faces) visual stimuli. We identified regions that preferred particular stimulus categories during localizer scans, combined those regions into joint-ROIs, and measured multivoxel patterns in the joint-ROIs for each stimulus class during task scans. We then spatially correlated these stimulus-evoked patterns to the multivoxel pattern measured in each frame of resting-state scans. The mean correlation coefficient was essentially zero for all regions/stimulus categories, indicating that resting activity patterns were not biased toward particular stimuli. However, the spread of correlation coefficients (positive, negative) was significantly greater for a joint-ROI's preferred stimulus. Moreover, at single timepoints the resting multivoxel patterns in constituent ROIs of a joint-ROI were not independent but formed a coherent brain state. Therefore, spontaneous activity patterns were coherent across regions, and maximally varied within a region in the degree to which they positively or negatively matched the pattern evoked by the region's preferred stimulus. We conclude that in human visual cortex spontaneous multi-voxel activity patterns are linked to stimulus-evoked patterns.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A GWAS-Derived Polygenic Score for Interleukin-1β is Associated with Hippocampal Volume in Two Samples</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/516989v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Accumulating research suggests that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) has a modulatory effect on the hippocampus, a brain structure important for learning and memory as well as linked with both psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we use an imaging genetics strategy to test an association between an IL-1{beta} polygenic score, derived from summary statistics of a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating cytokines, and hippocampal volume, in two independent samples. In the first sample of 512 non-Hispanic Caucasian university students (274 women, mean age 19.78 years, SD=1.24) from the Duke Neurogenetics Study, we identified a significant positive correlation between higher polygenic scores, which presumably reflect higher circulating IL-1{beta} levels, and average hippocampal volume. This positive association was successfully replicated in a second sample of 7,960 white British volunteers (4,158 women, mean age 62.63 years, SD=7.45) from the UK Biobank. Collectively, our results suggest that a functional GWAS-derived score of IL-1{beta} blood circulating levels affects hippocampal volume, and lend further support in humans, to the link between IL-1{beta} and the structure of the hippocampus.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Easily accessible biomarkers in Huntington disease (HD) are actively searched. We investigated telomere length and DNA double‐strand breaks (histone variant pγ‐H2AX) as predictive disease biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 premanifest subjects, 58 HD patients with similar CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene (&lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;), and 44 healthy controls (HC). PBMC from the pre‐HD and HD groups showed shorter telomeres (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and a significant increase of pγ‐H2AX compared to the controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The levels of pγ‐H2AX correlated robustly with the presence of the mutated gene in pre‐HD and HD. The availability of a potentially reversible biomarker (pγ‐H2AX) in the premanifest stage of HD, negligible in HC, provides a novel tool to monitor premanifest subjects and find patient‐specific drugs.

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on &quot;fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia,&quot; &quot;fear avoidance beliefs,&quot; or &quot;pain anxiety,&quot; pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied multiple kernel learning approach allowed the generation of models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of nonoverlapping neural predictors within fear-processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Gamma oscillations in the basolateral amygdala: biophysical mechanisms and computational consequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0388-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BL) is thought to support numerous emotional behaviors through specific microcircuits. These are often thought to be comprised of feedforward networks of principal cells and interneurons. Neither well-understood nor often considered are recurrent and feedback connections, which likely engender oscillatory dynamics within BL. Indeed, oscillations in the gamma frequency range (40-100 Hz) are known to occur in the BL, and yet their origin and effect on local circuits remains unknown. To address this, we constructed a biophysically and anatomically detailed model of the rat BL and its local field potential based on the physiological and anatomical literature, along with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data we collected on the activities of neurons within the rat BL. Remarkably, the model produced intermittent gamma oscillations (~50-70 Hz) whose properties matched those recorded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, including their entrainment of spiking. BL gamma-band oscillations were generated by the intrinsic circuitry, depending upon reciprocal interactions between principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons, while connections within these cell types affected the rhythm’s frequency. The model allowed us to conduct experimentally impossible tests to characterize the synaptic and spatial properties of gamma. The entrainment of individual neurons to gamma depended on the number of afferent connections they received, and gamma bursts were spatially restricted in the BL. Importantly, the gamma rhythm synchronized principal cells and mediated competition between ensembles. Together, these results indicate that the recurrent connectivity of BL expands its computational and communication repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data we develop the first large-scale biophysically and anatomically realistic model of the basolateral amygdala nucleus (BL), which reproduces the dynamics of the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; local field potential (LFP). Significantly, it predicts that BL intrinsically generates the transient gamma oscillations observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The model permitted exploration of the poorly understood synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma genesis in BL, and the model's ability to compute LFPs at arbitrary numbers of recording sites provided insights into the characteristics of the spatial properties of gamma bursts. Furthermore, we show how gamma synchronizes principal cells to overcome their low firing rates while simultaneously promoting competition, potentially impacting their afferent selectivity and efferent drive, and thus emotional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed in patients with different neurological disorders, but cells producing these auto‐antibodies are largely unexplored. We detect circulating GAD‐reactive B cells in peripheral blood that readily differentiate into antibody‐producing cells. These cells are highly elevated in most patients with GAD‐antibody‐associated disorders (n=15) compared to controls (n=19). They mainly produce GAD65‐antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses and are as abundant as B cells reactive for common recall antigens. Bone marrow cells represent an additional source of GAD‐antibodies. The identification of GAD‐antibody‐producing cells has implications for the selection of cell‐specific biologics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: APRIL‐mediated anti‐inflammatory response of astrocytes in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25415?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the two related TNF members APRIL and BAFF are currently targeted in autoimmune diseases as B‐cell regulators. In multiple sclerosis (MS), combined APRIL/BAFF blockade led to an unexpected exacerbated inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients. Here, we investigate the role of the APRIL/BAFF axis in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL expression was analyzed in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role of APRIL was assessed in the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Functional &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies were performed with human and mouse astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL was expressed in lesions from EAE. In its absence, the disease was worst. Lesions from MS patients also showed APRIL expression upon infiltration of macrophages. Notably, all the APRIL secreted by these macrophages specifically targeted astrocytes. The upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) bearing sometimes chondroitin sulfate of type E sugar moieties, binding APRIL, in reactive astrocytes explained the latter selectivity. Astrocytes responded to APRIL by producing sufficient amount of IL‐10 to dampen antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and pathogenic cytokine secretion. Finally, an intraspinal delivery of recombinant APRIL before disease onset shortly reduced EAE symptoms. Repeated intravenous injections of recombinant APRIL before and even at disease onset had also an effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our data show that APRIL mediates an anti‐inflammatory response from astrocytes in MS lesions. This protective activity is not shared with BAFF.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To validate imaging features able to discriminate neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders from multiple sclerosis with conventional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this cross‐sectional study, brain and spinal cord scans were evaluated from 116 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders patients (98 seropositive and 18 seronegative) in chronic disease phase and 65 age‐, sex‐ and disease duration‐matched multiple sclerosis patients. To identify independent predictors of neuromyelitis optica diagnosis, after assessing the prevalence of typical/atypical findings, the original cohort was 2:1 randomized in a training sample (where a multivariate logistic regression analysis was run) and a validation sample (where the performance of the selected variables was tested and validated).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical brain lesions occurred in 50.9% of neuromyelitis optica patients (18.1% brainstem periventricular/periaqueductal; 32.7% periependymal along lateral ventricles, 3.4% large hemispheric; 6.0% diencephalic; 4.3% cortico‐spinal tract), 72.2% had spinal cord lesions (46.3% long transverse myelitis, 36.1% short transverse myelitis) 37.1% satisfied 2010 McDonald criteria and none had cortical lesions. Fulfillment of at least 2/5 of: absence of juxtacortical/cortical lesions, absence of periventricular lesions, absence of Dawson's fingers, presence of long transverse myelitis or presence of periependymal lesions along lateral ventricles, discriminated neuromyelitis optica patients in both training (sensitivity [95% confidence interval ]=0.92 [0.84‐0.97], specificity=0.91 [0.78‐0.97]) and validation samples (sensitivity=0.82 [0.66‐0.92], specificity=0.91 [0.71‐0.99]). MRI findings and criteria performance were similar irrespective of serostatus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although up to 50% of neuromyelitis optica patients have no typical lesions and a relatively high percentage of them satisfies multiple sclerosis criteria, several easily applicable imaging features can help to identify neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amyloid‐β (Aβ) cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) holds that brain accumulation of Aβ initiates the disease process. Accordingly, drug research has targeted Aβ production, clearance or deposition as therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, candidate drugs have failed to show clinical benefit in established, early or prodromal disease, or those with high AD risk. Currently, monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against the most neurotoxic Aβ forms are undergoing large scale trials to confirm initially encouraging results. However, recent findings on the normal physiology of Aβ suggest that accumulation may be compensatory rather than the pathological initiator. If this is true, alternative strategies will be needed to defeat this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioural symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilises post‐mortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorised into two groups: “motor” or “mood”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, post‐mortem delay, CAG repeat in the IT15 gene or age at death.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provide novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt; encodes the plasma membrane Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Dicarboxylate Cotransporter 3 (NaDC3), which imports inside the cell four to six carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a markedly increased and persisting over time urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG). In one patient, increased cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) concentrations were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful and a genetic cause was suspected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WES analysis revealed variants in &lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt;. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by RT‐PCR performed in muscle tissue (c.1016+3A&amp;gt;G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate and NAA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and &lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt; mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An Analysis of the Accuracy of the P300 BCI. (arXiv:1901.03299v1 [eess.SP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The P300 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a well-established communication
channel for severely disabled people. The P300 event-related potential is
mostly characterized by its amplitude or its area, which correlate with the
spelling accuracy of the P300 speller. Here, we introduce a novel approach for
estimating the efficiency of this BCI by considering the P300 signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), a parameter that estimates the spatial and temporal noise levels
and has a significantly stronger correlation with spelling accuracy.
Furthermore, we suggest a Gaussian noise model, which utilizes the P300
event-related potential SNR to predict spelling accuracy under various
conditions for LDA-based classification. We demonstrate the utility of this
analysis using real data and discuss its potential applications, such as
speeding up the process of electrode selection.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain stimulation and its widespread use is one of the most important
subjects in studies of neurophysiology. In brain electrical stimulation
methods, following the surgery and electrode implantation, electrodes send
electrical impulses to the specific targets in the brain. The use of this
stimulation method is provided therapeutic benefits for treatment chronic pain,
essential tremor, Parkinsons disease, major depression, and neurological
movement disorder syndrome (dystonia). One area in which advancements have been
recently made is in controlling the movement and navigation of animals in a
specific pathway. It is important to identify brain targets in order to
stimulate appropriate brain regions for all the applications listed above. An
animal navigation system based on brain electrical stimulation is used to
develop new behavioral models for the aim of creating a platform for
interacting with the animal nervous system in the spatial learning task. In the
context of animal navigation the electrical stimulation has been used either as
creating virtual sensation for movement guidance or virtual reward for movement
motivation. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of brain
electrical stimulation for this application has been reviewed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Revealing interpretable object representations from human behavior. (arXiv:1901.02915v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02915</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02915</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we
estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human
behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories. These
representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which
captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments.
Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly
reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership,
functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the
predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human
behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings,
suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of
objects beyond the specific task.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Integrin alpha11 is an Osteolectin receptor and is required for the maintenance of adult skeletal bone mass</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42274</guid>

	<description>We previously discovered a new osteogenic growth factor that is required to maintain adult skeletal bone mass, Osteolectin/Clec11a. Osteolectin acts on Leptin Receptor&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (LepR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) skeletal stem cells and other osteogenic progenitors in bone marrow to promote their differentiation into osteoblasts. Here we identity a receptor for Osteolectin, integrin a11, which is expressed by LepR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and osteoblasts. a11b1 integrin binds Osteolectin with nanomolar affinity and is required for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Itga11&lt;/i&gt; (which encodes a11) from mouse and human bone marrow stromal cells impaired osteogenic differentiation and blocked their response to Osteolectin. Like &lt;i&gt;Osteolectin&lt;/i&gt; deficient mice, &lt;i&gt;Lepr&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Itga11&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice appeared grossly normal but exhibited reduced osteogenesis and accelerated bone loss during adulthood. Osteolectin binding to a11b1 promoted Wnt pathway activation, which was necessary for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. This reveals a new mechanism for maintenance of adult bone mass: Wnt pathway activation by Osteolectin/a11b1 signaling.</description>

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve &lt;i&gt;selective&lt;/i&gt; analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I_DH2nH8efs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The high failure rate of therapeutics showing promise in mouse models to translate to patients is a pressing challenge in biomedical science. Though retrospective studies have examined the fidelity of mouse models to their respective human conditions, approaches for prospective translation of insights from mouse models to patients remain relatively unexplored. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach for inference of disease-associated human differentially expressed genes and pathways from mouse model experiments. We examined 36 transcriptomic case studies where comparable phenotypes were available for mouse and human inflammatory diseases and assessed multiple computational approaches for inferring human biology from mouse datasets. We found that semi-supervised training of a neural network identified significantly more true human biological associations than interpreting mouse experiments directly. Evaluating the experimental design of mouse experiments where our model was most successful revealed principles of experimental design that may improve translational performance. Our study shows that when prospectively evaluating biological associations in mouse studies, semi-supervised learning approaches, combining mouse and human data for biological inference, provide the most accurate assessment of human &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disease processes. Finally, we proffer a delineation of four categories of model system-to-human “Translation Problems” defined by the resolution and coverage of the datasets available for molecular insight translation and suggest that the task of translating insights from model systems to human disease contexts may be better accomplished by a combination of translation-minded experimental design and computational approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XOH4TEke77c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR), therefore S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded 1-2 weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; laser scanning photostimulation revealed that layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits. (246/250 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), a mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the orofacial region, including the tooth pulps. IAN transection (IANX) induces allodynia in the maxillary nerve-projecting region. This study demonstrates the facilitation of excitatory propagation in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR) following maxillary molar tooth pulp stimulation in IANX rats. Both pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons in layer II/III S2/IOR of IANX rats received larger glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the deeper layers. Reduction of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSCs in pyramidal neurons of IANX rats may contribute to the facilitated excitation in S2/IOR. These findings suggest that GABAergic neurons in S2/IOR could be a therapeutic target for ectopic pain in the orofacial region. (118/120 words)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Methamphetamine self-administration elicits sex related changes in postsynaptic glutamate transmission in the prefrontal cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-clinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male and females rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during self-administration; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDAR in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The rate of methamphetamine (METH) addiction is second only to heroin, and use trends are on the rise. Like other drugs of abuse, there are known sex differences in METH addiction, however if these differences result from sex differences in pharmacokinetics, neurophysiology, and/or drug-induced neuroplasticity has not been established. Here we assessed METH self-administration induced neuroadaptations in synaptic physiology using electrophysiological measures in prefrontal cortical brain slices of male and female rats. We are the first to report, to our knowledge, that cortical baseline and METH-induced synaptic responses are different between male and female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females and highlight the possibility that sex-specific treatment strategies may be required to address METH-induced neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Isoflurane inhibits dopaminergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis coupled to CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 in rat midbrain neurons</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Volatile anesthetics affect neuronal signaling by poorly understood mechanisms. Activation of central dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in emergence from general anesthesia. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane differentially inhibits glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis by reducing presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx without affecting the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-exocytosis relationship, but its effects on dopaminergic exocytosis are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane inhibits exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons. We used electrical stimulation or depolarization by elevated extracellular KCl to evoke exocytosis measured by quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging in cultured rat ventral tegmental area neurons. Using trains of electrically evoked action potentials (APs), isoflurane inhibited exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons to a greater extent (30 ± 4% inhibition; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in non-dopaminergic neurons (15 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.014). Isoflurane also inhibited exocytosis evoked by elevated KCl in dopaminergic neurons (35 ± 6% inhibition; p = 0.0007), but not in non-dopaminergic neurons (2 ± 4% inhibition). Pharmacological isolation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subtypes showed that isoflurane inhibited KCl-evoked exocytosis mediated exclusively by either Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (30 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.0002) or by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 (N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (35 ± 11% inhibition; p = 0.015). Additionally, isoflurane inhibited single AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx by 41 ± 3% and single AP-evoked exocytosis by 34 ± 6%. Comparable reductions in exocytosis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx were produced by lowering extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus, isoflurane inhibits exocytosis from dopaminergic neurons by a mechanism distinct from that in non-dopaminergic neurons involving reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite their medical importance, the mechanisms of action of general anesthetics have not been fully elucidated. Isoflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels and differentially inhibits synaptic vesicle exocytosis depending on neurotransmitter phenotype. Here we show that in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area isoflurane acts via a sodium channel-independent mechanism to inhibit synaptic vesicle exocytosis in proportion to reduced presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux mediated by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, in contrast to its effects in non-dopaminergic neurons. These findings provide a synaptic mechanism for the observed role of reduced dopamine release in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and implicate presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels of dopaminergic neurons as important targets of isoflurane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP), and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key feature of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) trigger GnRH neuronal activity, but how GnRH neurons return to baseline electrical activity is unknown. Nociceptin/orphanin-FQ (OFQ) is an inhibitory neuromodulator. ARC proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, known to receive inputs from ARC kisspeptin neurons, contact GnRH neurons and coexpress OFQ in the rat. In the present study, the effect of OFQ(1-13) on GnRH neurons was determined in the mouse. We identified transcripts for the OFQ receptor [opioid receptor like 1 (ORL1)] in GnRH neurons, and, using two-model systems (explants and slices), we found that OFQ exerted a potent inhibition on GnRH neurons, with or without excitatory inputs. We confirmed that the inhibition was mediated by ORL1 via G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein coupling. The inhibition, occurring independently of levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, was sensitive to inwardly rectifying potassium channels. The only specific blocker of G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), was ineffective in the inhibition of OFQ. Two GIRK activators, one sharing the binding site of TPNQ and one active only on GIRK1-containing GIRK channels, failed to trigger an inhibition. In contrast, protein kinase C phosphorylation activation, known to inhibit GIRK2-mediated currents, prevented the OFQ inhibition. These results indicate a specific combination of GIRK subunits, GIRK2/3 in GnRH neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, double-labeled OFQ/POMC fibers were found in the vicinity of GnRH neurons, and OFQ fibers apposed GnRH neurons. Together, this study brings to light a potent neuromodulator of GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There has been considerable effort to use these profiles to understand cell diversity, primarily through unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis. However, current practices to validate these findings vary. In this review, we describe recent efforts to evaluate clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and provide a framework for considering current evidence and practices in terms of their capacity to establish principles of cell biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has already transformed neuroscience. By facilitating detailed comparative and genetic perturbation analyses, it may provide the tools to uncover fundamental mechanisms of neural diversity throughout the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes duneuro, a software toolbox for forward modeling in
neuroscience. Its purpose is to provide extendible and easy-to-use interfaces
and enable a closer integration into existing analysis pipelines. It provides
implementations of fitted and unfitted finite element methods and makes use of
the Dune framework. The forward problems consist of the electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) forward problems. For the incorporation
into existing analysis pipelines, Python and Matlab interfaces are provided.
The practical use is demonstrated on a source analysis example of evoked
potentials.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A strong preference for novelty emerges in infancy and is prevalent across
the animal kingdom. When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning
algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly
increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in
situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review
parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning
algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled
in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty
representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel
objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty
information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based
learning.

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is classified as a serious threat pathogen and is a priority that guides the discovery and development of new antibiotics. Despite growing knowledge of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; metabolic capabilities, our understanding of its systems-level responses to different media types remains incomplete. Here, we develop a manually reconstructed genome-scale model (GEM-PRO) of metabolism with 3D protein structures for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; USA300 str. JE2 containing 854 genes, 1,440 reactions, 1,327 metabolites and 673 3-dimensional protein structures. Computations were in 85% agreement with gene essentiality data from random barcode transposon site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) and 68% agreement with experimental physiological data. Comparisons of computational predictions with experimental observations highlight: 1) cases of non-essential biomass precursors; 2) metabolic genes subject to transcriptional regulation involved in Staphyloxanthin biosynthesis; 3) the essentiality of purine and amino acid biosynthesis in synthetic physiological media; and 4) a switch to aerobic fermentation upon exposure to extracellular glucose elucidated as a result of integrating time-course of quantitative exo-metabolomics data. An up-to-date GEM-PRO thus serves as a knowledge-based platform to elucidate &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus’&lt;/i&gt; metabolic response to its environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2DiKjhA9eEg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Advancing age is the dominant risk factor for most of the major killer diseases in developed countries. Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yjtn-ZF7ak8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Correlates of Absolute Pitch in a Passive Auditory Oddball Paradigm: a Direct Replication Attempt</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans with absolute pitch (AP) are able to effortlessly name the pitch class of a sound without an external reference. The association of labels with pitches cannot be entirely suppressed even if it interferes with task demands. This suggests a high level of automaticity of pitch labeling in AP. The automatic nature of AP was further investigated in a study by Rogenmoser et al. (2015). Using a passive auditory oddball paradigm in combination with electroencephalography, they observed electrophysiological differences between musicians with and without AP in response to piano tones. Specifically, the AP musicians showed a smaller P3a, an event-related potential (ERP) component presumably reflecting early attentional processes. In contrast, they did not find group differences in the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component associated with auditory memory processes. They concluded that early cognitive processes are facilitated in AP during passive listening and are more important for AP than the preceding sensory processes. In our direct replication study on a larger sample of musicians with (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54, 27 females, 27 males) and without (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 50, 24 females, 26 males) AP, we successfully replicated the non-significant effects of AP on the MMN. However, we could not replicate the significant effects for the P3a. Additional Bayes factor analyses revealed moderate to strong evidence (Bayes factor &amp;gt; 3) for the null hypothesis for both MMN and P3a. Therefore, the results of this replication study do not support the postulated importance of cognitive facilitation in AP during passive tone listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Top-down and Bottom-up Regulated Auditory Phantom Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/364?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/364?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory phantom percepts such as tinnitus are associated with auditory deafferentation. The idea is that auditory deafferentation limits the amount of information the brain can acquire to make sense of the world. Because of this, auditory deafferentation increases the uncertainty of the auditory environment. To minimize uncertainty, the deafferented brain will attempt to obtain or fill in the missing information. A proposed multiphase compensation model suggests two distinct types of bottom-up related tinnitus: an auditory cortex related tinnitus and a parahippocampal cortex related tinnitus. The weakness of this model is that it cannot explain why some people without hearing loss develop tinnitus, whereas conversely others with hearing loss do not develop tinnitus. In this human study, we provide evidence for a top-down type of tinnitus associated with a deficient noise-cancelling mechanism. A total of 72 participants (age: 40.96 ± 7.67 years; males: 48; females: 24) were recruited for this study. We demonstrate that top-down related tinnitus is related to a change in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex that corresponds to increased activity in the auditory cortex. This is in accordance with the idea that tinnitus can have different generators as proposed in a recent model that suggests that different compensation mechanisms at a cortical level can be linked to phantom percepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic tinnitus affects 15% of the population worldwide. The term &quot;tinnitus&quot; however represents a highly heterogeneous condition, as evidenced by the fact that there are no effective treatments or even an adequate understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, our research shows that tinnitus indeed has different subtypes related to hearing loss. In a human study tightly controlled for hearing loss, we establish a tinnitus subtype associated with a deficient top-down noise-cancelling mechanism, which distinguishes it from bottom-up subtypes. We demonstrate that top-down related tinnitus relates to a change in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex that corresponds to increased activity in the auditory cortex, whereas bottom-up tinnitus instead relates to changes in the parahippocampal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Directing Voluntary Temporal Attention Increases Fixational Stability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/353?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/353?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our visual input is constantly changing, but not all moments are equally relevant. Visual temporal attention, the prioritization of visual information at specific points in time, increases perceptual sensitivity at behaviorally relevant times. The dynamic processes underlying this increase are unclear. During fixation, humans make small eye movements called microsaccades, and inhibiting microsaccades improves perception of brief stimuli. Here, we investigated whether temporal attention changes the pattern of microsaccades in anticipation of brief stimuli. Human observers (female and male) judged stimuli presented within a short sequence. Observers were given either an informative precue to attend to one of the stimuli, which was likely to be probed, or an uninformative (neutral) precue. We found strong microsaccadic inhibition before the stimulus sequence, likely due to its predictable onset. Critically, this anticipatory inhibition was stronger when the first target in the sequence (T1) was precued (task-relevant) than when the precue was uninformative. Moreover, the timing of the last microsaccade before T1 and the first microsaccade after T1 shifted such that both occurred earlier when T1 was precued than when the precue was uninformative. Finally, the timing of the nearest pre- and post-T1 microsaccades affected task performance. Directing voluntary temporal attention therefore affects microsaccades, helping to stabilize fixation at the most relevant moments over and above the effect of predictability. Just as saccading to a relevant stimulus can be an overt correlate of the allocation of spatial attention, precisely timed gaze stabilization can be an overt correlate of the allocation of temporal attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We pay attention at moments in time when a relevant event is likely to occur. Such temporal attention improves our visual perception, but how it does so is not well understood. Here, we discovered a new behavioral correlate of voluntary, or goal-directed, temporal attention. We found that the pattern of small fixational eye movements called microsaccades changes around behaviorally relevant moments in a way that stabilizes the position of the eyes. Microsaccades during a brief visual stimulus can impair perception of that stimulus. Therefore, such fixation stabilization may contribute to the improvement of visual perception at attended times. This link suggests that, in addition to cortical areas, subcortical areas mediating eye movements may be recruited with temporal attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Dynamics and Response Modulation across the Human Visual System in a Spatial Attention Task: An ECoG Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The selection of behaviorally relevant information from cluttered visual scenes (often referred to as &quot;attention&quot;) is mediated by a cortical large-scale network consisting of areas in occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex that is organized into a functional hierarchy of feedforward and feedback pathways. In the human brain, little is known about the temporal dynamics of attentional processing from studies at the mesoscopic level of electrocorticography (ECoG), that combines millisecond temporal resolution with precise anatomical localization of recording sites. We analyzed high-frequency broadband responses (HFB) responses from 626 electrodes implanted in 8 epilepsy patients who performed a spatial attention task. Electrode locations were reconstructed using a probabilistic atlas of the human visual system. HFB responses showed high spatial selectivity and tuning, constituting ECoG response fields (RFs), within and outside the topographic visual system. In accordance with monkey physiology studies, both RF widths and onset latencies increased systematically across the visual processing hierarchy. We used the spatial specificity of HFB responses to quantitatively study spatial attention effects and their temporal dynamics to probe a hierarchical top-down model suggesting that feedback signals back propagate the visual processing hierarchy. Consistent with such a model, the strengths of attentional modulation were found to be greater and modulation latencies to be shorter in posterior parietal cortex, middle temporal cortex and ventral extrastriate cortex compared with early visual cortex. However, inconsistent with such a model, attention effects were weaker and more delayed in anterior parietal and frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the human brain, visual attention has been predominantly studied using methods with high spatial, but poor temporal resolution such as fMRI, or high temporal, but poor spatial resolution such as EEG/MEG. Here, we investigate temporal dynamics and attention effects across the human visual system at a mesoscopic level that combines precise spatial and temporal measurements by using electrocorticography in epilepsy patients performing a classical spatial attention task. Electrode locations were reconstructed using a probabilistic atlas of the human visual system, thereby relating them to topography and processing hierarchy. We demonstrate regional differences in temporal dynamics across the attention network. Our findings do not fully support a top-down model that promotes influences on visual cortex by reversing the processing hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Individual Differences in Dopamine Are Associated with Reward Discounting in Clinical Groups But Not in Healthy Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/321?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people are more willing to make immediate, risky, or costly reward-focused choices than others, which has been hypothesized to be associated with individual differences in dopamine (DA) function. In two studies using PET imaging, one empirical (Study 1: &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 144 males and females across 3 samples) and one meta-analytic (Study 2: &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 307 across 12 samples), we sought to characterize associations between individual differences in DA and time, probability, and physical effort discounting in human adults. Study 1 demonstrated that individual differences in DA D2-like receptors were not associated with time or probability discounting of monetary rewards in healthy humans, and associations with physical effort discounting were inconsistent across adults of different ages. Meta-analytic results for temporal discounting corroborated our empirical finding for minimal effect of DA measures on discounting in healthy individuals but suggested that associations between individual differences in DA and reward discounting depend on clinical features. Addictions were characterized by negative correlations between DA and discounting, but other clinical conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, obesity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, were characterized by positive correlations between DA and discounting. Together, the results suggest that trait differences in discounting in healthy adults do not appear to be strongly associated with individual differences in D2-like receptors. The difference in meta-analytic correlation effects between healthy controls and individuals with psychopathology suggests that individual difference findings related to DA and reward discounting in clinical samples may not be reliably generalized to healthy controls, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Decisions to forgo large rewards for smaller ones due to increasing time delays, uncertainty, or physical effort have been linked to differences in dopamine (DA) function, which is disrupted in some forms of psychopathology. It remains unclear whether alterations in DA function associated with psychopathology also extend to explaining associations between DA function and decision making in healthy individuals. We show that individual differences in DA D2 receptor availability are not consistently related to monetary discounting of time, probability, or physical effort in healthy individuals across a broad age range. By contrast, we suggest that psychopathology accounts for observed inconsistencies in the relationship between measures of DA function and reward discounting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MDMA Increases Cooperation and Recruitment of Social Brain Areas When Playing Trustworthy Players in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/307?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning and can be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The Prisoner's Dilemma is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly characterized, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent behavior unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating how the serotonergic enhancer 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) modulates behavior and its neural correlates during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents. We administered 100 mg MDMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned, participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in levels of cooperation. On each round, participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42–2.84, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78–2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA's effect on social decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) on cooperative behavior during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that, following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behavior have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared with placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behavior are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents' behavior in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasizing the important role of the behavior of others toward us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurochemical and Behavioral Dissections of Decision-Making in a Rodent Multistage Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/295?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flexible decision-making in dynamic environments requires both retrospective appraisal of reinforced actions and prospective reasoning about the consequences of actions. These complementary reinforcement-learning systems can be characterized computationally with model-free and model-based algorithms, but how these processes interact at a neurobehavioral level in normal and pathological states is unknown. Here, we developed a translationally analogous multistage decision-making (MSDM) task to independently quantify model-free and model-based behavioral mechanisms in rats. We provide the first direct evidence that male rats, similar to humans, use both model-free and model-based learning when making value-based choices in the MSDM task and provide novel analytic approaches for independently quantifying these reinforcement-learning strategies. Furthermore, we report that &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; dopamine tone in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex correlate with model-based, but not model-free, strategies, indicating that the biological mechanisms mediating decision-making in the multistage task are conserved in rats and humans. This new multistage task provides a unique behavioral platform for conducting systems-level analyses of decision-making in normal and pathological states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Decision-making is influenced by both a retrospective &quot;model-free&quot; system and a prospective &quot;model-based&quot; system in humans, but the biobehavioral mechanisms mediating these learning systems in normal and disease states are unknown. Here, we describe a translationally analogous multistage decision-making task to provide a behavioral platform for conducting neuroscience studies of decision-making in rats. We provide the first evidence that choice behavior in rats is influenced by model-free and model-based systems and demonstrate that model-based, but not model-free, learning is associated with corticostriatal dopamine tone. This novel behavioral paradigm has the potential to yield critical insights into the mechanisms mediating decision-making alterations in mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Layer 3 Dynamically Coordinates Columnar Activity According to Spatial Context</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/281?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/281?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To reduce statistical redundancy of natural inputs and increase the sparseness of coding, neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) show tuning for stimulus size and surround suppression. This integration of spatial information is a fundamental, context-dependent neural operation involving extensive neural circuits that span across all cortical layers of a V1 column, and reflects both feedforward and feedback processing. However, how spatial integration is dynamically coordinated across cortical layers remains poorly understood. We recorded single- and multiunit activity and local field potentials across V1 layers of awake mice (both sexes) while they viewed stimuli of varying size and used dynamic Bayesian model comparisons to identify when laminar activity and interlaminar functional interactions showed surround suppression, the hallmark of spatial integration. We found that surround suppression is strongest in layer 3 (L3) and L4 activity, where suppression is established within ~10 ms after response onset, and receptive fields dynamically sharpen while suppression strength increases. Importantly, we also found that specific directed functional connections were strongest for intermediate stimulus sizes and suppressed for larger ones, particularly for connections from L3 targeting L5 and L1. Together, the results shed light on the different functional roles of cortical layers in spatial integration and on how L3 dynamically coordinates activity across a cortical column depending on spatial context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) show tuning for stimulus size, where responses to stimuli exceeding the receptive field can be suppressed (surround suppression). We demonstrate that functional connectivity between V1 layers can also have a surround-suppressed profile. A particularly prominent role seems to have layer 3, the functional connections to layers 5 and 1 of which are strongest for stimuli of optimal size and decreased for large stimuli. Our results therefore point toward a key role of layer 3 in coordinating activity across the cortical column according to spatial context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Auditory Thalamostriatal and Corticostriatal Pathways Convey Complementary Information about Sound Features</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/271?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/271?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple parallel neural pathways link sound-related signals to behavioral responses. For instance, the striatum, a brain structure involved in action selection and reward-related learning, receives neuronal projections from both the auditory thalamus and auditory cortex. It is not clear whether sound information that reaches the striatum through these two pathways is redundant or complementary. We used an optogenetic approach in awake mice of both sexes to identify thalamostriatal and corticostriatal neurons during extracellular recordings, and characterized neural responses evoked by sounds of different frequencies and amplitude modulation rates. We found that neurons in both pathways encode sound frequency with similar fidelity, but display different coding strategies for amplitude modulated noise. Whereas corticostriatal neurons provide a more accurate representation of amplitude modulation rate in their overall firing rate, thalamostriatal neurons convey information about the precise timing of acoustic events. These results demonstrate that auditory thalamus and auditory cortex neurons provide complementary information to the striatum, and suggest that these pathways could be differentially recruited depending on the requirements of a sound-driven behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sensory signals from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus converge onto the striatum, a nucleus implicated in reward-related learning. It is not clear whether these two sensory inputs convey redundant or complementary information. By characterizing the sound-evoked responses of thalamostriatal and corticostriatal neurons, our work demonstrates that these neural pathways convey complementary information about the temporal features of sounds. This work opens new avenues for investigating how these pathways could be selectively recruited depending on task demands, and provides a framework for studying convergence of cortical and thalamic information onto the striatum in other sensory systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Thalamocortical and Intracortical Inputs Differentiate Layer-Specific Mouse Auditory Corticocollicular Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/256?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long-range descending projections from the auditory cortex play key roles in shaping response properties in the inferior colliculus. The auditory corticocollicular projection is massive and heterogeneous, with axons emanating from cortical layers 5 and 6, and plays a key role in directing plastic changes in the inferior colliculus. However, little is known about the cortical and thalamic networks within which corticocollicular neurons are embedded. Here, laser scanning photostimulation glutamate uncaging and photoactivation of channelrhodopsin-2 were used to probe the local and long-range network differences between preidentified layer 5 and layer 6 auditory corticocollicular neurons from male and female mice &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Layer 5 corticocollicular neurons were found to vertically integrate supragranular excitatory and inhibitory input to a substantially greater degree than their layer 6 counterparts. In addition, all layer 5 corticocollicular neurons received direct and large thalamic inputs from channelrhodopsin-2-labeled thalamocortical fibers, whereas such inputs were less common in layer 6 corticocollicular neurons. Finally, a new low-calcium/synaptic blockade approach to separate direct from indirect inputs using laser photostimulation was validated. These data demonstrate that layer 5 and 6 corticocollicular neurons receive distinct sets of cortical and thalamic inputs, supporting the hypothesis that they have divergent roles in modulating the inferior colliculus. Furthermore, the direct connection between the auditory thalamus and layer 5 corticocollicular neurons reveals a novel and rapid link connecting ascending and descending pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Descending projections from the cortex play a critical role in shaping the response properties of sensory neurons. The projection from the auditory cortex to the inferior colliculus is a massive, yet poorly understood, pathway emanating from two distinct cortical layers. Here we show, using a range of optical techniques, that mouse auditory corticocollicular neurons from different layers are embedded into different cortical and thalamic networks. Specifically, we observed that layer 5 corticocollicular neurons integrate information across cortical lamina and receive direct thalamic input. The latter connection provides a hyperdirect link between acoustic sensation and descending control, thus demonstrating a novel mechanism for rapid &quot;online&quot; modulation of sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Repo Homeodomain Transcription Factor Suppresses Hematopoiesis in Drosophila and Preserves the Glial Fate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/238?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite their different origins, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; glia and hemocytes are related cell populations that provide an immune function. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; hemocytes patrol the body cavity and act as macrophages outside the nervous system, whereas glia originate from the neuroepithelium and provide the scavenger population of the nervous system. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; glia are hence the functional orthologs of vertebrate microglia, even though the latter are cells of immune origin that subsequently move into the brain during development. Interestingly, the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; immune cells within (glia) and outside (hemocytes) the nervous system require the same transcription factor glial cells deficient/glial cells missing (Glide/Gcm) for their development. This raises the issue of how do glia specifically differentiate in the nervous system, and hemocytes in the procephalic mesoderm. The Repo homeodomain transcription factor and panglial direct target of Glide/Gcm is known to ensure glial terminal differentiation. Here we show that Repo also takes center stage in the process that discriminates between glia and hemocytes. First, Repo expression is repressed in the hemocyte anlagen by mesoderm-specific factors. Second, Repo ectopic activation in the procephalic mesoderm is sufficient to repress the expression of hemocyte-specific genes. Third, the lack of Repo triggers the expression of hemocyte markers in glia. Thus, a complex network of tissue-specific cues biases the potential of Glide/Gcm. These data allow us to revise the concept of fate determinants and help us to understand the bases of cell specification. Both sexes were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Distinct cell types often require the same pioneer transcription factor, raising the issue of how one factor triggers different fates. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, glia and hemocytes provide a scavenger activity within and outside the nervous system, respectively. While they both require the glial cells deficient/glial cells missing (Glide/Gcm) transcription factor, glia originate from the ectoderm, and hemocytes from the mesoderm. Here we show that tissue-specific factors inhibit the gliogenic potential of Glide/Gcm in the mesoderm by repressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Repo, a major glial-specific target of Glide/Gcm. Repo expression in turn inhibits the expression of hemocyte-specific genes in the nervous system. These cell-specific networks secure the establishment of the glial fate only in the nervous system and allow cell diversification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Association of mGluR-Dependent LTD of Excitatory Synapses with Endocannabinoid-Dependent LTD of Inhibitory Synapses Leads to EPSP to Spike Potentiation in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/224?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The input-output relationships in neural circuits are determined not only by synaptic efficacy but also by neuronal excitability. Activity-dependent alterations of synaptic efficacy have been extensively investigated, but relatively less is known about how the neuronal output is modulated when synaptic efficacy changes are associated with neuronal excitability changes. In this study, we demonstrate that paired pulses of low-frequency stimulation (PP-LFS) induced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses in Sprague Dawley rats (both sexes), and this LTD was associated with EPSP to spike (E-S) potentiation, leading to the increase in action potential (AP) outputs. Threshold voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) for APs evoked by synaptic stimulation and that by somatic current injection were hyperpolarized significantly after PP-LFS. Blockers of GABA receptors mimicked and occluded PP-LFS effects on E-S potentiation and V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; hyperpolarization, suggesting that suppression of GABAergic mechanisms is involved in E-S potentiation after PP-LFS. Indeed, IPSCs and tonic inhibitory currents were reduced after PP-LFS. The IPSC reduction was accompanied by increased paired-pulse ratio, and abolished by AM251, a blocker for Type 1 cannabinoid receptors, suggesting that PP-LFS suppresses presynaptic GABA release by mGluR-dependent endocannabinoids signaling. By contrast, a Group 1 mGluR agonist, 3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, induced LTD at SC-CA1 synapses but failed to induce significant IPSC reduction and AP output increase. We propose that mGluR signaling that induces LTD coexpression at excitatory and inhibitory synapses regulates an excitation-inhibition balance to increase neuronal output in CA1 neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity are usually associated with excitability changes, the ability to fire action potentials. However, excitability changes have been regarded to play subsidiary roles to synaptic plasticity in modifying neuronal output. We demonstrate that, when metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD is induced by paired pulses of low-frequency stimulation, the action potential output in response to a given input paradoxically increases, indicating that increased excitability is more powerful than synaptic depression. This increase is mediated by the suppression of a presynaptic GABA release via metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent endocannabinoid signaling. Our study shows that neuronal output changes do not always follow the direction of synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses, highlighting the importance of regulating inhibitory tone via endocannabinoid signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Apo-Opsin Exists in Equilibrium Between a Predominant Inactive and a Rare Highly Active State</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bleaching adaptation in rod photoreceptors is mediated by apo-opsin, which activates phototransduction with effective activity 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;- to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-fold lower than that of photoactivated rhodopsin (meta II). However, the mechanism that produces such low opsin activity is unknown. To address this question, we sought to record single opsin responses in mouse rods. We used mutant mice lacking efficient calcium feedback to boosts rod responses and generated a small fraction of opsin by photobleaching ~1% of rhodopsin. The bleach produced a dramatic increase in the frequency of discrete photoresponse-like events. This activity persisted for hours, was quenched by 11-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-retinal, and was blocked by uncoupling opsin from phototransduction, all indicating opsin as its source. Opsin-driven discrete activity was also observed in rods containing non-activatable rhodopsin, ruling out transactivation of rhodopsin by opsin. We conclude that bleaching adaptation is mediated by opsin that exists in equilibrium between a predominant inactive and a rare meta II-like state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Electrophysiological analysis is used to show that the G-protein-coupled receptor opsin exists in equilibrium between a predominant inactive and a rare highly active state that mediates bleaching adaptation in photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamin 1 Restrains Vesicular Release to a Subquantal Mode In Mammalian Adrenal Chromaffin Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/199?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/2/199?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamin 1 (dyn1) is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in most secretory (neuronal and neuroendocrine) cells. There are two modes of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent catecholamine release from single dense-core vesicles: full-quantal (quantal) and subquantal in adrenal chromaffin cells, but their relative occurrences and impacts on total secretion remain unclear. To address this fundamental question in neurotransmission area using both sexes of animals, here we report the following: (1) dyn1-KO increased quantal size (QS, but not vesicle size/content) by ≥250% in dyn1-KO mice; (2) the KO-increased QS was rescued by dyn1 (but not its deficient mutant or dyn2); (3) the ratio of quantal versus subquantal events was increased by KO; (4) following a release event, more protein contents were retained in WT versus KO vesicles; and (5) the fusion pore size (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was increased from ≤9 to ≥9 nm by KO. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced exocytosis is generally a subquantal release in sympathetic adrenal chromaffin cells, implying that neurotransmitter release is generally regulated by dynamin in neuronal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent neurotransmitter release from a single vesicle is the primary event in all neurotransmission, including synaptic/neuroendocrine forms. To determine whether Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent vesicular neurotransmitter release is &quot;all-or-none&quot; (quantal), we provide compelling evidence that most Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced secretory events occur via the subquantal mode in native adrenal chromaffin cells. This subquantal release mode is promoted by dynamin 1, which is universally required for most secretory cells, including neurons and neuroendocrine cells. The present work with dyn1-KO mice further confirms that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent transmitter release is mainly via subquantal mode, suggesting that subquantal release could be also important in other types of cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are taken over by the
neocortex through a process called systems consolidation. However, reactivation
of a consolidated memory can induce a brief period of temporary
hippocampus-dependence, followed by return to hippocampus-independence. Here we
present a computational model that uses simulation of recently described
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to account for findings from the systems
consolidation/reconsolidation literature and to make predictions for future
research.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Extracting impedance changes from a frequency multiplexed signal during neural activity in sciatic nerve of rat: preliminary study in-vitro. (arXiv:1901.02068v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02068</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Establish suitable frequency spacing and demodulation steps to use
when extracting impedance changes from frequency division multiplexed (FDM)
carrier signals in peripheral nerve. Approach: Experiments were performed
in-vitro on cadavers immediately following euthanasia. Neural activity was
evoked via stimulation of nerves in the hind paw, while carrier signals were
injected, and recordings obtained, with a dual ring nerve cuff implanted on the
sciatic nerve. Frequency analysis of recorded compound action potentials (CAPs)
and extracted impedance changes, with the latter obtained using established
demodulation methods, were used to determine suitable frequency spacing of
carrier signals, and bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth and order, for a frequency
multiplexed signal. Main results: CAPs and impedance changes were dominant in
the frequency band 200 to 500 Hz and 100 to 200 Hz, respectively. A Tukey
window was introduced to remove ringing from Gibbs phenomena. A +/- 750 Hz BPF
bandwidth was selected to encompass 99.99 % of the frequency power of the
impedance change. Modelling predicted a minimum BPF order of 16 for 2 kHz
spacing, and 10 for 4 kHz spacing, were required to avoid ringing from the
neighbouring carrier signal, while FDM experiments verified BPF orders of 12
and 8, respectively, were required. With a notch filter centred on the
neighbouring signal, a BPF order of at least 6 or 4 was required for 2 and 4
kHz, respectively. Significance: The results establish drive frequency spacing
and demodulation settings for use in FDM electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
experiments, as well as a framework for their selection, and, for the first
time, demonstrates the viability of FDM-EIT of neural activity on peripheral
nerve, which will be a central aspect of future real-time neural-EIT systems
and EIT-based neural prosthetics interfaces.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Computational Model of Dual Competition between the Basal Ganglia and the Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We propose a model that includes interactions between the cortex, the basal ganglia (BG), and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of BG to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning and the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) using a novel paradigm predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The systemDrive: a Multisite, Multiregion Microdrive with Independent Drive Axis Angling for Chronic Multimodal Systems Neuroscience Recordings in Freely Behaving Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0261-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A multielectrode system that can address widely separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive, a novel multisite, multiregion microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and nonparallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube–cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and nonparallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long–Evans rats to observe simultaneous single-unit and multiunit activity from multiple widely separated sleep–wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we analyze the cognitive improvements that can be achieved
through hacking the brain and using neuroplasticity. Not all cases of
neuroplasticity are useful, but exposure to gaming, for example, has proven
conducive for learning. We will discuss cortical magnification and receptive
field sizes, as well as topographic brain maps in the context of
neuroplasticity. We finally propose more studies to be performed to improve
musical talent and musical abilities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a new model of the oculomotor system, particularly the
vestibulo-ocular reflex, the optokinetic reflex, gaze fixation, and smooth
pursuit. Our key insight is to exploit recent developments on adaptive internal
models. The outcome is a simple model that includes the interactions between
the brainstem and the cerebellum and that recovers behaviors from more than 15
oculomotor experiments. In addition, we put forward a thesis that the
cerebellum embodies internal models of all persistent, exogenous reference and
disturbance signals acting on the body and observable through the error signals
it receives. Our proposed architecture is compared to feedback error learning,
a variant of the computed torque method in robotics and currently the best
developed computational architecture for the cerebellum.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Calcium phosphate precipitation inhibits mitochondrial energy metabolism</title>

Early studies have shown that moderate levels of calcium overload can cause lower oxidative phosphorylation rates. However, the mechanistic interpretations of these findings were inadequate. And while the effect of excessive calcium overload on mitochondrial function is well appreciated, there has been little to no reports on the consequences of low to moderate calcium overload. To resolve this inadequacy, mitochondrial function from guinea pig hearts was quantified using several well-established methods including high-resolution respirometry and spectrofluorimetry and analyzed using mathematical modeling. We measured key mitochondrial variables such as respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, buffer calcium, and substrate effects for a range of mitochondrial calcium loads from near zero to levels approaching mitochondrial permeability transition. In addition, we developed a computer model closely mimicking the experimental conditions and used this model to design experiments capable of eliminating many hypotheses generated from the data analysis. We subsequently performed those experiments and determined why mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration is significantly lowered during calcium overload. We found that when calcium phosphate levels, not matrix free calcium, reached sufficient levels, complex I activity is inhibited, and the rate of ATP synthesis is reduced. Our findings suggest that calcium phosphate granules form physical barriers that isolate complex I from NADH, disrupt complex I activity, or destabilize cristae and inhibit NADH-dependent respiration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBuKxc7t56w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The lack of a deep understanding of how proteins interact remains an important roadblock in advancing efforts to identify binding partners and uncover the corresponding regulatory mechanisms of the functions they mediate. Understanding protein-protein interactions is also essential for designing specific chemical modifications to develop new reagents and therapeutics. We explored the hypothesis of whether protein interaction sites serve as generic biding sites for non-cognate protein ligands, just as it has been observed for small-molecule-binding sites in the past. Using extensive computational docking experiments on a test set of 241 protein complexes, we found that indeed there is a strong preference for non-cognate ligands to bind to the cognate binding site of a receptor. This observation appears to be robust to variations in docking programs, types of non-cognate protein probes, sizes of binding patches, relative sizes of binding patches and full-length proteins, and the exploration of obligate and non-obligate complexes. The accuracy of the docking scoring function appears to play a role in defining the correct site. The frequency of interaction of unrelated probes recognizing the binding interface was utilized in a simple prediction algorithm that showed accuracy competitive with other state of the art methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xdzyIfrYTuk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cancer development is driven by series of events involving mutations, which may become fixed in a tumor via genetic drift and selection. This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30–40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline &lt;i&gt;ELANE&lt;/i&gt; mutation. Acquired mutations in &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; occur in &amp;gt;70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an &lt;i&gt;ELANE&lt;/i&gt; mutation causes SCN; &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; truncation mutation. Phase 2 occurs postnatally through adult stages with bone marrow production of granulocyte precursors and positive selection of mutants due to chronic G-CSF therapy to reverse the severe neutropenia. We predict the existence of the pool of cells with the mutated truncated receptor &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; G-CSF treatment begins. The model does not require increase in mutation rate under G-CSF treatment and agrees with age distribution of sMDS onset and clinical sequencing data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HE-IeA48wrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Classical decision theory postulates that choices proceed from subjective values assigned to the probable outcomes of alternative actions. Some authors have argued that opposite causality should also be envisaged, with choices influencing subsequent values expressed in desirability ratings. The idea is that agents may increase their ratings of items that they have chosen in the first place, which has been typically explained by the need to reduce cognitive dissonance. However, evidence in favor of this reverse causality has been the topic of intense debates that have not reached consensus so far. Here, we take a novel approach using Bayesian techniques to compare models in which choices arise from stable (but noisy) underlying values (one-way causality) versus models in which values are in turn influenced by choices (two-way causality). Moreover, we examined whether in addition to choices, other components of previous actions, such as the effort invested and the eventual action outcome (success or failure), could also impact subsequent values. Finally, we assessed whether the putative changes in values were only expressed in explicit ratings, or whether they would also affect other value-related behaviors such as subsequent choices. Behavioral data were obtained from healthy participants in a rating-choice-rating-choice-rating paradigm, where the choice task involves deciding whether or not to exert a given physical effort to obtain a particular food item. Bayesian selection favored two-way causality models, where changes in value due to previous actions affected subsequent ratings, choices and action outcomes. Altogether, these findings may help explain how values and actions drift when several decisions are made successively, hence highlighting some shortcomings of classical decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UYQdWjzKcBg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age‐at‐onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25409?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transthyretin (TTR) related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in &lt;i&gt;TTR&lt;/i&gt;. Age‐at‐onset (AO) ranges 19‐82 years and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of ten genes, had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed 329 Portuguese patients, from 123 families. Repeat length (at &lt;i&gt;ATXN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TBP, ATN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;JPH3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;DMPK&lt;/i&gt;) was assessed by single and multiplex PCR, using fluorescently‐labelled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centred approach and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for AO correlation between family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, the presence of at least one allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% CI: [‐8.81; ‐2.19], p=0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat &lt;i&gt;loci&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Length of normal repeats at &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; role in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow‐up of presymptomatic carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agonism of protease‐activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro‐ and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 μg/kg of 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra‐arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest‐dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540 μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 ± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 ± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co‐occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well‐validated measure of systemic vascular risk and &lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;‐amyloid (A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office‐based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS‐CVD). We acquired A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant interaction between FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS‐CVD and elevated A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.16).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neural basis of induced phantom limb pain relief</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‐related disease mechanisms. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. Although NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‐induced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalization to related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a within‐participants, double‐blind, and sham‐controlled design to alleviate PLP via task‐concurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least 1 week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‐ and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‐ and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‐concurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions. &lt;b&gt;Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite much attention to the use of biomarkers for predicting Alzheimer disease, little information is available at the individual level. We used the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging to estimate absolute risk of cognitive impairment by biomarker group. Risk increased with age and any biomarker abnormality. For example, a 75‐year‐old with abnormal amyloid and cortical thinning biomarkers has about a 20% chance of cognitive impairment by age 80 years, whereas with normal biomarkers the chance is &amp;lt;10%. Persons with only one abnormal biomarker had similar intermediate risks. Ann Neurol 2018:1–6&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use digital histology in a large autopsy cohort of Lewy body disorder (LBD) patients with dementia to test the hypotheses that co‐occurring Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology impacts the anatomic distribution of α‐synuclein (SYN) pathology and that co‐occurring neocortical tau pathology in LBDs associates with worse cognitive performance and occurs in a pattern differing from AD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐five autopsy‐confirmed LBD (Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 36; dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 19) patients and 25 AD patients were studied. LBD patients were categorized as having moderate/severe AD copathology (SYN + AD = 20) or little/no AD copathology (SYN−AD = 35). Digital measures of tau, β‐amyloid (Aβ), and SYN histopathology in neocortical and subcortical/limbic regions were compared between groups and related to antemortem cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN burden was higher in SYN + AD than SYN−AD in each neocortical region (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 54&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.6–6.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.02) but was equivalent in entorhinal cortex and putamen (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 43–49&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7–1.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.2). SYN + AD performed worse than SYN−AD on a temporal lobe–mediated naming task (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Antemortem cognitive test scores inversely correlated with tau burden (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = −0.39 to −0.68, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). AD had higher tau than SYN + AD in all regions (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 43&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.8–97.2, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); however, SYN + AD had a greater proportion of tau in the temporal neocortex than AD (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas AD had a greater proportion of tau in the frontal neocortex than SYN + AD (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.002). SYN + AD had similar severity and distribution of neocortical Aβ compared to AD (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 40–43&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6–2.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBD patients with AD copathology harbor greater neocortical SYN pathology. Regional tau pathology relates to cognitive performance in LBD dementia, and its distribution may diverge from pure AD. Tau copathology contributes uniquely to the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in LBD. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Clinical Outcomes Depending on Acute Blood Pressure After Cerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible patients who were randomized to the ATACH‐2 (Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2) trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;: NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&amp;lt;120, 120–130, 130–140, 140–150, and ≥ 150 mmHg) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 to 6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 ml from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardiorenal adverse events within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4 to 6 was 37.5, 36.0, 42.8, 38.6, and 38.0%, respectively. For the “140 to 150” group relative to the “120 to 130,” the odds ratio (OR), adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9, 13.7, 21.4, 18.5, and 26.4%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05–3.09) and “≥150” (1.98; 1.12–3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than the 120 to 130 group. Cardiorenal events occurred in 13.6, 16.6, 11.5, 8.1, and 8.2%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (0.43; 0.19–0.88) and ≥ 150 (0.44; 0.18–0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the 120 to 130.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120 to 130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardiorenal complications. &lt;b&gt;Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01024</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a disorder characterised by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Both
local and network abnormalities have been associated with epilepsy, and the
exact processes generating seizures are thought to be heterogeneous and
patient-specific. Due to the heterogeneity, treatments such as surgery and
medication are not always effective in achieving full seizure control and
choosing the best treatment for the individual patient can be challenging.
Predictive models constrained by the patient's own data therefore offer the
potential to assist in clinical decision making. In this chapter, we describe
how personalised patient-derived networks from structural or functional
connectivity can be incorporated into predictive models. We focus specifically
on dynamical systems models which are composed of differential equations
capable of simulating brain activity over time. Here we review recent studies
which have used these models, constrained by patient data, to make personalised
patient-specific predictions about seizure features (such as propagation
patterns) or treatment outcomes (such as the success of surgical resection).
Finally, we suggest future research directions for patient-specific network
models in epilepsy, including their application to integrate information from
multiple modalities, to predict long-term disease evolution, and to account for
within-subject variability for treatment.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Unified Theory of Early Visual Representations from Retina to Cortex through Anatomically Constrained Deep CNNs. (arXiv:1901.00945v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual system is hierarchically organized to process visual information
in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first
stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell
receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,
whereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a
precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these
differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional
neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we
show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence
of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,
and we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at
the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced
number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the
optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple
cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as
nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and
faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result
predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated
nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,
whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the
visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These
predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina
as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes,
by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two
objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their
visual system.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hemispheric Module-Specific Influence of the X Chromosome on White Matter Connectivity: Evidence from Girls with Turner Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by the congenital absence of all or part of one of the X chromosomes in females, offering a valuable human “knockout model” to study the functioning patterns of the X chromosome in the human brain. Little is known about whether and how the loss of the X chromosome influences the brain structural wiring patterns in human. We acquired a multimodal MRI dataset and cognitive assessments from 22 girls with TS and 21 age-matched control girls to address these questions. Hemispheric white matter (WM) networks and modules were derived using refined diffusion MRI tractography. Statistical comparisons revealed a reduced topological efficiency of both hemispheric networks and bilateral parietal modules in TS girls. Specifically, the efficiency of right parietal module significantly mediated the effect of the X chromosome on working memory performance, indicating that X chromosome loss impairs working memory performance by disrupting this module. Additionally, TS girls showed structural and functional connectivity decoupling across specific within- and between-modular connections, predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings provide novel insights into the functional pathways in the brain that are regulated by the X chromosome and highlight a module-specific genetic contribution to WM connectivity in the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: I See Your Effort: Force-Related BOLD Effects in an Extended Action Execution–Observation Network Involving the Cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Action observation (AO) is crucial for motor planning, imitation learning, and social interaction, but it is not clear whether and how an action execution–observation network (AEON) processes the effort of others engaged in performing actions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used a “squeeze ball” task involving different grip forces to investigate whether AEON activation showed similar patterns when executing the task or observing others performing it. Both in action execution, AE (subjects performed the visuomotor task) and action observation, AO (subjects watched a video of the task being performed by someone else), the fMRI signal was detected in cerebral and cerebellar regions. These responses showed various relationships with force mapping onto specific areas of the sensorimotor and cognitive systems. Conjunction analysis of AE and AO was repeated for the “0th” order and linear and nonlinear responses, and revealed multiple AEON nodes remapping the detection of actions, and also effort, of another person onto the observer’s own cerebrocerebellar system. This result implies that the AEON exploits the cerebellum, which is known to process sensorimotor predictions and simulations, performing an internal assessment of forces and integrating information into high-level schemes, providing a crucial substrate for action imitation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Enhanced Population Coding for Rewarded Choices in the Medial Frontal Cortex of the Mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Instrumental behavior is characterized by the selection of actions based on the degree to which they lead to a desired outcome. However, we lack a detailed understanding of how rewarded actions are reinforced and preferentially implemented. In rodents, the medial frontal cortex is hypothesized to play an important role in this process, based in part on its capacity to encode chosen actions and their outcomes. We therefore asked how neural representations of choice and outcome might interact to facilitate instrumental behavior. To investigate this question, we imaged neural ensemble activity in layer 2/3 of the secondary motor region (M2) while mice engaged in a two-choice auditory discrimination task with probabilistic outcomes. Correct choices could result in one of three reward amounts (single, double or omitted reward), which allowed us to measure neural and behavioral effects of reward magnitude, as well as its categorical presence or absence. Single-unit and population decoding analyses revealed a consistent influence of outcome on choice signals in M2. Specifically, rewarded choices were more robustly encoded relative to unrewarded choices, with little dependence on the exact magnitude of reinforcement. Our results provide insight into the integration of past choices and outcomes in the rodent brain during instrumental behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The mesolimbic hypothesis has been a central dogma of schizophrenia for decades, positing that aberrant functioning of midbrain dopamine projections to limbic regions causes psychotic symptoms. Recently, however, advances in neuroimaging techniques have led to the unanticipated finding that dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia is greatest within nigrostriatal pathways, implicating the dorsal striatum in the pathophysiology and calling into question the mesolimbic theory. At the same time our knowledge of striatal anatomy and function has progressed, suggesting new mechanisms via which striatal dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational model to understand mouse iron physiology and disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006680</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jignesh H. Parmar, Pedro Mendes&lt;/p&gt;

It is well known that iron is an essential element for life but is toxic when in excess or in certain forms. Accordingly there are many diseases that result directly from either lack or excess of iron. Yet many molecular and physiological aspects of iron regulation have only been discovered recently and others are still elusive. There is still no good quantitative and dynamic description of iron absorption, distribution, storage and mobilization that agrees with the wide array of phenotypes presented in several iron-related diseases. The present work addresses this issue by developing a mathematical model of iron distribution in mice calibrated with ferrokinetic data and subsequently validated against data from mouse models of iron disorders, such as hemochromatosis, β-thalassemia, atransferrinemia and anemia of inflammation. To adequately fit the ferrokinetic data required inclusion of the following mechanisms: a) transferrin-mediated iron delivery to tissues, b) induction of hepcidin by transferrin-bound iron, c) ferroportin-dependent iron export regulated by hepcidin, d) erythropoietin regulation of erythropoiesis, and e) liver uptake of NTBI. The utility of the model to simulate disease interventions was demonstrated by using it to investigate the outcome of different schedules of transferrin treatment in β-thalassemia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4qKAR8v5jU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Locus Coeruleus tracking of prediction errors optimises cognitive flexibility: An Active Inference model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006267</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna C. Sales, Karl J. Friston, Matthew W. Jones, Anthony E. Pickering, Rosalyn J. Moran&lt;/p&gt;

The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm ‘explore/exploit’ task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level ‘state-action’ prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error–reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release–to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC that translates state-action prediction errors into an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A_rbYMuEoU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the relationship between the interictal metabolic patterns, the extent of resection of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET hypometabolism and seizure outcomes in patients with unilateral drug‐resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) following anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐two patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal MRI findings, concordant &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET hypometabolism and at least two years of postoperative follow‐up were included in this two‐centre study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypometabolic regions in each patient were identified with reference to twenty healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.005). The resected temporal lobe (TL) volume and the volume of resected TL PET hypometabolism (TLH) were calculated from the pre‐ and postoperative MRI scans co‐registered with interictal &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking differences in metabolic patterns were observed depending on the lateralisation of the epileptogenic temporal lobe. The extent of the ipsilateral TLH was significantly greater in left MTLE patients &lt;i&gt;(p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), whereas right MTLE patients had significantly higher rates of contralateral (CTL) TLH (&lt;i&gt;p=&lt;/i&gt;0.016). In right MTLE patients, CTL hypometabolism was the strongest predictor of an unfavourable seizure outcome, associated with a five‐fold increase in the likelihood of seizure recurrence (OR 4.90, CI:1.07‐22.39, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.04). In left MTLE patients, the greater the extent of the resection of ipsilateral TLH was associated with lower rates of seizure recurrence (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.004) in univariable analysis, however its predictive value did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.96, CI: 0.90‐1.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.19).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in metabolic patterns depending on the lateralisation of MTLE may represent distinct epileptic networks in patients with right &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; left MTLE, and can guide preoperative counselling and surgical planning.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Activity patterns in the neuropil of striatal cholinergic interneurons in freely moving mice represent their collective spiking dynamics</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&amp;lt; 2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are key modulators of the striatal microcircuitry that are necessary for assigning action value and behavioral flexibility. We present a first endoscopic imaging study of multiple molecularly identified CINs in freely moving mice. We reveal the presence of activity patterns in the CIN neuropil. We then use &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological and imaging techniques to show that the neuropil signal is the integrated fluorescence arising from the axo-dendritic arbors of CINs dispersed throughout the striatum. We conclude that the neuropil signal acts as a mean-field readout of the striatal CIN network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neuron-Specific Gene 2 (NSG2) encodes an AMPA receptor interacting protein that modulates excitatory neurotransmission</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neurons have evolved a number of unique protein-coding genes that regulate trafficking of protein complexes within small organelles throughout dendrites axons. Neuron specific gene 2 (NSG2) encodes for one of the most abundant proteins in the nervous system during perinatal development. NSG2 belongs to a family of small neuronal endosomal proteins but its function has remained uncharacterized to date. Here we show that NSG2 is found in discrete punctae restricted to the somatodendritic arbors of developing mouse and human neurons, and a significant proportion of NSG2 punctae colocalize with postsynaptic HOMER1 and surface-expressed AMPARs at excitatory synapses. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NSG2 physically interacts with both the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits in mouse brain. Knockout of NSG2 in mouse hippocampal neurons selectively impaired the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and caused alterations in PSD95 expression at postsynaptic densities. In contrast, NSG2 overexpression caused a significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as GluA2 surface expression. Thus, NSG2 functions as an AMPAR-binding protein that is required for normal synapse formation and/or maintenance, and has unique functions compared with other NSG family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Due to their morphological and functional complexity, neurons have evolved specialized proteins like those of the neuron-specific gene family (NSG1-3). Important developmental and synaptic functions have been attributed to NSG1/NEEP21 and NSG3/Calcyon while the function of NSG2/HMP19/NVTA2 has remained uncharacterized. Here we show that NSG2 localizes to a large proportion of excitatory synapses, interacts with AMPARs, and modulates their surface expression during synaptogenesis. Alterations of NSG2 expression affected both the amplitude and frequency of excitatory neurotransmission that is not compensated for by other NSG family members. Thus, NSG2 appears critical for excitatory synapse formation and/or maintenance and forced expression can promote increased synaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: NMNAT proteins that limit Wallerian degeneration also regulate critical period plasticity in the visual cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions go through critical periods of development during which plasticity is enhanced. These critical periods are associated with extensive growth and retraction of thalamocortical and intracortical axons. Here, we investigated whether a signaling pathway that is central in Wallerian axon degeneration also regulates critical period plasticity in the primary visual cortex. Wallerian degeneration is characterized by rapid disintegration of axons once they are separated from the cell body. This degenerative process is initiated by reduced presence of cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) and is strongly delayed in mice overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT proteins, such as Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice producing a UBE4b-NMNAT1 fusion protein or NMNAT3 transgenic mice. Here we provide evidence that in Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice and NMNAT3-transgenic mice, ocular dominance plasticity in the developing visual cortex is reduced. This deficit is only observed during the second half of the critical period. Additionally, we detect an early increase of visual acuity in the primary visual cortex of Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We do not find evidence for Wallerian degeneration occurring during ocular dominance plasticity. Our findings suggest that NMNATs do not only regulate Wallerian degeneration during pathological conditions, but also control cellular events that mediate critical period plasticity during the physiological development of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Different forms of axon degeneration occur during development and neurodegenerative processes. A good understanding of the molecular and cellular events that regulate these forms of axon degeneration is essential to selectively modulate them for therapeutic purposes. This study shows that genes thought to be selectively involved in pathological axon degeneration are also involved in developmental plasticity, implying that these events are molecularly less separable than previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired conditioned fear extinction learning, a ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-dependent process. PTSD is also associated with dysregulation of vmPFC, circadian, and glucocorticoid hormone function. Rats have rhythmic clock gene expression in the vmPFC that requires appropriate diurnal circulatory patterns of corticosterone (CORT), suggesting the presence of CORT-entrained intrinsic circadian clock function within the PFC. We examined the role of vmPFC clock gene expression and its interaction with CORT profiles in regulation of auditory conditioned fear extinction learning. Extinction learning and recall were examined in male rats trained and tested either in the night (active phase) or in the day (inactive phase). Using a viral vector strategy, &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; clock gene expression were selectively knocked down within the vmPFC. Circulating CORT profiles were manipulated via adrenalectomy (ADX) ± diurnal and acute CORT replacement. Rats trained and tested during the night exhibited superior conditioned fear extinction recall that was absent in rats that had knock-down of vmPFC clock gene expression. Similarly, the superior nighttime extinction recall was absent in ADX rats, but restored in ADX rats given a combination of a diurnal pattern of CORT and acute elevation of CORT during the postextinction training consolidation period. Thus, conditioned fear extinction learning is regulated in a diurnal fashion that requires normal vmPFC clock gene expression and a combination of circadian and training-associated CORT. Strategic manipulation of these factors may enhance the therapeutic outcome of conditioned fear extinction related treatments in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the survival motor neuron (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking SMN. We find that reducing daf-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in &lt;i&gt;daf-2&lt;/i&gt; signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Decoding Hand Kinematics from Local Field Potentials Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. (arXiv:1901.00708v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Local field potential (LFP) has gained increasing interest as an alternative
input signal for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) due to its informative
features, long-term stability, and low frequency content. However, despite
these interesting properties, LFP-based BMIs have been reported to yield low
decoding performances compared to spike-based BMIs. In this paper, we propose a
new decoder based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network which aims to
improve the decoding performance of LFP-based BMIs. We compare offline decoding
performance of the proposed LSTM decoder to a commonly used Kalman filter (KF)
decoder on hand kinematics prediction tasks from multichannel LFPs. We also
benchmark the performance of LFP-driven LSTM decoder against KF decoder driven
by two types of spike signals: single-unit activity (SUA) and multi-unit
activity (MUA). Our results show that LFP-driven LSTM decoder achieves
significantly better decoding performance than LFP-, SUA-, and MUA-driven KF
decoders. This suggests that LFPs coupled with LSTM decoder could provide high
decoding performance, robust, and low power BMIs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the present work, electroencephalographic recordings of healthy human
participants were performed to study the entrainment of brainwaves using a
variety of stimulus. First, periodic entrainment of the brainwaves was studied
using two different stimuli in the form of periodic auditory and visual
signals. The entrainment with the periodic visual stimulation was consistently
observed, whereas the auditory entrainment was inconclusive. Hence, a photic
(Visual) stimulus, where two frequencies were presented to the subject
simultaneously was used to further explore the bifrequency entrainment of human
brainwaves. Subsequently, the evolution of brainwaves as a result of an
aperiodic stimulation was explored, wherein an entrainment to the predetermined
aperiodic pattern was observed. These results suggest that aperiodic
entrainment could be used as a tool for guided modification of brainwaves. This
could find possible applications in processes such as epilepsy suppression and
biofeedback.

	<description>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is among the most common birth defects. Children with CHD frequently display long-term intellectual and behavioral disability. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac anomalies lead to a reduction in cerebral oxygenation, which appears to profoundly impact on the maturation of cerebral regions responsible for higher-order cognitive functions. In this review we focus on the potential mechanisms by which dysregulation of cortical neuronal development during early life may lead to the significant cognitive impairments that commonly occur in children with CHD.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Instant Automated Inference of Perceived Mental Stress through Smartphone PPG and Thermal Imaging. (arXiv:1901.00449v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00449</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00449</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: A smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular
measurement and mental stress monitoring. A smartphone camera-based
PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and a low-cost thermal camera can be used to create
cheap, convenient and mobile monitoring systems. However, to ensure reliable
monitoring results, a person has to remain still for several minutes while a
measurement is being taken. This is very cumbersome and makes its use in
real-life mobile situations quite impractical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective: We propose a system which combines PPG and thermography with the
aim of improving cardiovascular signal quality and capturing stress responses
quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: Using a smartphone camera with a low cost thermal camera added on,
we built a novel system which continuously and reliably measures two different
types of cardiovascular events: i) blood volume pulse and ii)
vasoconstriction/dilation-induced temperature changes of the nose tip. 17
healthy participants, involved in a series of stress-inducing mental workload
tasks, measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short window
of time (20 seconds) immediately after each task. Participants reported their
level of perceived mental stress using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). We
used normalized K-means clustering to reduce interpersonal differences in the
self-reported ratings. For the instant stress inference task, we built novel
low-level feature sets representing variability of cardiovascular patterns. We
then used the automatic feature learning capability of artificial Neural
Networks (NN) to improve the mapping between the extracted set of features and
the self-reported ratings. We compared our proposed method with existing
hand-engineered features-based machine learning methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results, Conclusions: ... due to limited space here, we refer to our
manuscript.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Time irreversibility and its application in epileptic brain electrical activities. (arXiv:1901.00258v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00258</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00258</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Time irreversibility (temporal asymmetry) is one of fundamental properties
that characterize the nonlinearity of complex dynamical processes, and our
brain is a typical complex dynamical system manifested with nonlinearity. Two
subtraction-based parameters, Ys and X2, are employed to measure the
probabilistic differences of permutations instead of raw vectors for the
simplified quantification of time irreversibility, which is validated by
chaotic and reversible processes and the surrogate data. We show that it is
equivalent to quantify time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic
difference between the forward and its backward processes and between the
symmetric permutations. And we detect time irreversibility of two groups of
epileptic EEGs, from the Nanjing General Hospital (NJGH) and from the public
Bonn epileptic database. In our contribution, the manifestation of nonlinearity
of whether healthy or diseased brain electrical activities is highlighted, and
the highest time irreversibility of epileptic EEG during seizures is
demonstrated. NJGH epileptic EEGs during seizure-free intervals of have lower
time irreversibility than the control data while those of the Bonn data sets
have higher nonlinearity than the healthy brain electrical activities. For the
inconsistent results, we conduct multi-scale analysis and elucidate from the
circadian rhythms in epileptic nonlinearity, however, more targeted researches
are needed to verify our assumptions or to determine if there are other reasons
leading to the inconsistency.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Nestin Regulates Neurogenesis in Mice Through Notch Signaling From Astrocytes to Neural Stem Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The intermediate filament (nanofilament) protein nestin is a marker of neural stem cells, but its role in neurogenesis, including adult neurogenesis, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of nestin in neurogenesis in adult nestin-deficient (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) mice. We found that the proliferation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; neural stem cells was not altered, but neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice was increased. Surprisingly, the proneurogenic effect of nestin deficiency was mediated by its function in the astrocyte niche. Through its role in Notch signaling from astrocytes to neural stem cells, nestin negatively regulates neuronal differentiation and survival; however, its expression in neural stem cells is not required for normal neurogenesis. In behavioral studies, nestin deficiency in mice did not affect associative learning but was associated with impaired long-term memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Short-term synaptic depression can increase the rate of information transfer at a release site</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehrdad Salmasi, Alex Loebel, Stefan Glasauer, Martin Stemmler&lt;/p&gt;

The release of neurotransmitters from synapses obeys complex and stochastic dynamics. Depending on the recent history of synaptic activation, many synapses depress the probability of releasing more neurotransmitter, which is known as synaptic depression. Our understanding of how synaptic depression affects the information efficacy, however, is limited. Here we propose a mathematically tractable model of both synchronous spike-evoked release and asynchronous release that permits us to quantify the information conveyed by a synapse. The model transits between discrete states of a communication channel, with the present state depending on many past time steps, emulating the gradual depression and exponential recovery of the synapse. Asynchronous and spontaneous releases play a critical role in shaping the information efficacy of the synapse. We prove that depression can enhance both the information rate and the information rate per unit energy expended, provided that synchronous spike-evoked release depresses less (or recovers faster) than asynchronous release. Furthermore, we explore the theoretical implications of short-term synaptic depression adapting on longer time scales, as part of the phenomenon of metaplasticity. In particular, we show that a synapse can adjust its energy expenditure by changing the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression without affecting the net information conveyed by each successful release. Moreover, the optimal input spike rate is independent of the amplitude or time constant of synaptic depression. We analyze the information efficacy of three types of synapses for which the short-term dynamics of both synchronous and asynchronous release have been experimentally measured. In hippocampal autaptic synapses, the persistence of asynchronous release during depression cannot compensate for the reduction of synchronous release, so that the rate of information transmission declines with synaptic depression. In the calyx of Held, the information rate per release remains constant despite large variations in the measured asynchronous release rate. Lastly, we show that dopamine, by controlling asynchronous release in corticostriatal synapses, increases the synaptic information efficacy in nucleus accumbens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vhPcXTPWKXs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) is the most abundant methylation, existing in &amp;gt;25% of human mRNAs. Exciting recent discoveries indicate the close involvement of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in regulating many different aspects of mRNA metabolism and diseases like cancer. However, our current knowledge about how m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels are controlled and whether and how regulation of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels of a specific gene can play a role in cancer and other diseases is mostly elusive. We propose in this paper a computational scheme for predicting m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-regulated genes and m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-associated disease, which includes Deep-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, the first model for detecting condition-specific m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites from MeRIP-Seq data with a single base resolution using deep learning and Hot-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, a new network-based pipeline that prioritizes functional significant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A genes and its associated diseases using the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and gene-disease heterogeneous networks. We applied Deep-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A and this pipeline to 75 MeRIP-seq human samples, which produced a compact set of 709 functionally significant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-regulated genes and nine functionally enriched subnetworks. The functional enrichment analysis of these genes and networks reveal that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A targets key genes of many critical biological processes including transcription, cell organization and transport, and cell proliferation and cancer-related pathways such as Wnt pathway. The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-associated disease analysis prioritized five significantly associated diseases including leukemia and renal cell carcinoma. These results demonstrate the power of our proposed computational scheme and provide new leads for understanding m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A regulatory functions and its roles in diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tnIdvfV3wQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of the cellular microenvironment as a regulator of phenotypic and functional cellular responses to perturbations. We have previously developed cell patterning techniques to control population context parameters, and here we demonstrate context-explorer (CE), a software tool to improve investigation cell fate acquisitions through community level analyses. We demonstrate the capabilities of CE in the analysis of human and mouse pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs, mPSCs) patterned in colonies of defined geometries in multi-well plates. CE employs a density-based clustering algorithm to identify cell colonies. Using this automatic colony classification methodology, we reach accuracies comparable to manual colony counts in a fraction of the time, both in micropatterned and unpatterned wells. Classifying cells according to their relative position within a colony enables statistical analysis of spatial organization in protein expression within colonies. When applied to colonies of hPSCs, our analysis reveals a radial gradient in the expression of the transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4. We extend these analyses to colonies of different sizes and shapes and demonstrate how the metrics derived by CE can be used to asses the patterning fidelity of micropatterned plates. We have incorporated a number of features to enhance the usability and utility of CE. To appeal to a broad scientific community, all of the software’s functionality is accessible from a graphical user interface, and convenience functions for several common data operations are included. CE is compatible with existing image analysis programs such as CellProfiler and extends the analytical capabilities already provided by these tools. Taken together, CE facilitates investigation of spatially heterogeneous cell populations for fundamental research and drug development validation programs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZCy9eTHmCXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structure, Activity and Function of a Singing CPG Interneuron Controlling Cricket Species-Specific Acoustic Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/96?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of species-specific song patterns is a driving force in the speciation of acoustic communicating insects. It must be closely linked to adaptations of the neuronal network controlling the underlying singing motor activity. What are the cellular and network properties that allow generating different songs? In five cricket species, we analyzed the structure and activity of the identified abdominal ascending opener interneuron, a homologous key component of the singing central pattern generator. The structure of the interneuron, based on the position of the cell body, ascending axon, dendritic arborization pattern, and dye coupling, is highly similar across species. The neuron's spike activity shows a tight coupling to the singing motor activity. In all species, current injection into the interneuron drives artificial song patterns, highlighting the key functional role of this neuron. However, the pattern of the membrane depolarization during singing, the fine dendritic and axonal ramifications, and the number of dye-coupled neurons indicate species-specific adaptations of the neuronal network that might be closely linked to the evolution of species-specific singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question in evolutionary neuroscience is how species-specific behaviors arise in closely related species. We demonstrate behavioral, neurophysiological, and morphological evidence for homology of one key identified interneuron of the singing central pattern generator in five cricket species. Across-species differences of this interneuron are also observed, which might be important to the generation of the species-specific song patterns. This work offers a comprehensive and detailed comparative analysis addressing the neuronal basis of species-specific behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Molecular Fingerprinting of On-Off Direction-Selective Retinal Ganglion Cells Across Species and Relevance to Primate Visual Circuits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/78?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to detect moving objects is an ethologically salient function. Direction-selective neurons have been identified in the retina, thalamus, and cortex of many species, but their homology has remained unclear. For instance, it is unknown whether direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) exist in primates and, if so, whether they are the equivalent to mouse and rabbit DSGCs. Here, we used a molecular/circuit approach in both sexes to address these issues. In mice, we identify the transcription factor Satb2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) as a selective marker for three RGC types: On–Off DSGCs encoding motion in either the anterior or posterior direction, a newly identified type of Off-DSGC, and an Off-sustained RGC type. In rabbits, we find that expression of Satb2 is conserved in On–Off DSGCs; however, it has evolved to include On–Off DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion in addition to anterior and posterior motion. Next, we show that macaque RGCs express Satb2 most likely in a single type. We used rabies virus-based circuit-mapping tools to reveal the identity of macaque Satb2-RGCs and discovered that their dendritic arbors are relatively large and monostratified. Together, these data indicate Satb2-expressing On–Off DSGCs are likely not present in the primate retina. Moreover, if DSGCs are present in the primate retina, it is unlikely that they express Satb2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to detect object motion is a fundamental feature of almost all visual systems. Here, we identify a novel marker for retinal ganglion cells encoding directional motion that is evolutionarily conserved in mice and rabbits, but not in primates. We show in macaque monkeys that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that express this marker comprise a single type and are morphologically distinct from mouse and rabbit direction-selective RGCs. Our findings indicate that On–Off direction-selective retinal neurons may have evolutionarily diverged in primates and more generally provide novel insight into the identity and organization of primate parallel visual pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Scene complexity modulates degree of feedback activity during object detection in natural scenes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006690</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Iris I. A. Groen, Sara Jahfari, Noor Seijdel, Sennay Ghebreab, Victor A. F. Lamme, H. Steven Scholte&lt;/p&gt;

Selective brain responses to objects arise within a few hundreds of milliseconds of neural processing, suggesting that visual object recognition is mediated by rapid feed-forward activations. Yet disruption of neural responses in early visual cortex beyond feed-forward processing stages affects object recognition performance. Here, we unite these discrepant findings by reporting that object recognition involves enhanced feedback activity (recurrent processing within early visual cortex) when target objects are embedded in natural scenes that are characterized by high complexity. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on natural scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was selectively enhanced for high complexity scenes. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was enhanced for target objects in scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by target objects were selectively enhanced at feedback stages of visual processing (from ~220 ms onwards) for high complexity scenes only. Third, behavioral performance for high complexity scenes deteriorated when participants were pressed for time and thus less able to incorporate the feedback activity. Modeling of the reaction time distributions using drift diffusion revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes, with evidence accumulation being coupled to trial-to-trial variation in the EEG feedback response. Together, these results suggest that while feed-forward activity may suffice to recognize isolated objects, the brain employs recurrent processing more adaptively in naturalistic settings, using minimal feedback for simple scenes and increasing feedback for complex scenes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bWxjgjN2aIw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exploring chromatin hierarchical organization via Markov State Modelling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhen Wah Tan, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a new computational method for exploring chromatin structural organization based on Markov State Modelling of Hi-C data, represented as an interaction network between genomic loci. A Markov process describes the random walk of a traveling probe in the corresponding energy landscape, mimicking the motion of a biomolecule involved in chromatin function. By studying the metastability of the associated Markov State Model upon annealing, the hierarchical structure of individual chromosomes is observed, and a corresponding set of structural partitions is identified at each level of hierarchy. Then, the notion of effective interaction between partitions is derived, delineating the overall topology and architecture of chromosomes. Mapping epigenetic data on the graphs of intra-chromosomal effective interactions helps in understanding how chromosome organization facilitates its function. A sketch of whole-genome interactions obtained from the analysis of 539 partitions from all 23 chromosomes, complemented by distributions of gene expression regulators and epigenetic factors, sheds light on the structure-function relationships in chromatin, delineating chromosomal territories, as well as structural partitions analogous to topologically associating domains and active / passive epigenomic compartments. In addition to the overall genome architecture shown by effective interactions, the affinity between partitions of different chromosomes was analyzed as an indicator of the degree of association between partitions in functionally relevant genomic interactions. The overall static picture of whole-genome interactions obtained with the method presented in this work provides a foundation for chromatin structural reconstruction and the modelling of chromatin dynamics to explore the regulation of genome function. The algorithms used in this study are implemented in a freely available Python package ChromaWalker (https://bitbucket.org/ZhenWahTan/chromawalker).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDKSI-jH4_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in three patients with early‐onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in two patients, and tumour embolization in a third). Our observations provide further &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura, and has diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid–liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer's Disease pathology. We previously showed OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1‐4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: GABAergic transmission underlies interictal epileptogenicity in pediatric FCD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of GABAergic transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human Focal Cortical Dysplasia, focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients operated from a Focal Cortical Dysplasia were performed on Multi Electrode Arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride co‐transporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focal Cortical Dysplasia slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. 36/47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in pro‐epileptic conditions in 6/8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling as a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors blocker stopped them in 2/3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;‐&lt;/sup&gt; co‐transporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9/12 cases, revealing a Cl&lt;sup&gt;‐&lt;/sup&gt; dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 sub‐cellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altered chloride cotransporters expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rapid and flexible learning during behavioral choices is critical to our daily endeavors and constitutes a hallmark of dynamic reasoning. An important paradigm to examine flexible behavior involves learning new arbitrary associations mapping visual inputs to motor outputs. We conjectured that visuomotor rules are instantiated by translating visual signals into actions through dynamic interactions between visual, frontal and motor cortex. We evaluated the neural representation of such visuomotor rules by performing intracranial field potential recordings in epilepsy subjects during a rule-learning delayed match-to-behavior task. Learning new visuomotor mappings led to the emergence of specific responses associating visual signals with motor outputs in 3 anatomical clusters in frontal, anteroventral temporal and posterior parietal cortex. After learning, mapping selective signals during the delay period showed interactions with visual and motor signals. These observations provide initial steps towards elucidating the dynamic circuits underlying flexible behavior and how communication between subregions of frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex leads to rapid learning of task-relevant choices.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Connectivity of Frontoparietal Regions Reveals Executive Attention and Consciousness Interactions</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The executive control network is involved in the voluntary control of novel and complex situations. Solving conflict situations or detecting errors have demonstrated to impair conscious perception of near-threshold stimuli. The aim of this study was to explore the neural mechanisms underlying executive control and its interaction with conscious perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. To this end, we used a dual-task paradigm involving Stroop and conscious detection tasks with near-threshold stimuli. A set of prefrontal and frontoparietal regions were more strongly engaged for incongruent than congruent trials while a distributed set of frontoparietal regions showed stronger activation for consciously than nonconsciously perceived trials. Functional connectivity analysis revealed an interaction between executive control and conscious perception in frontal and parietal nodes. The microstructural properties of the middle branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus were associated with neural measures of the interaction between executive control and consciousness. These results demonstrate that conscious perception and executive control share neural resources in frontoparietal networks, as proposed by some influential models.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Waves of Maturation and Senescence in Micro-structural MRI Markers of Human Cortical Myelination over the Lifespan</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Seminal human brain histology work has demonstrated developmental waves of myelination. Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker linked to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8–85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of seven cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30-s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50-s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60-s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Direct Evidence for Prediction Signals in Frontal Cortex Independent of Prediction Error</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy331</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy331/5257440?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction error (PE) signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from PE signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for PC in the form of PE signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here, we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex evinces prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The broadband high-frequency amplitude (HFA) was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single-trial HFA predicted deviations and correlated with poststimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of PE signals.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Learning has been proposed to coincide with changes in connections between brain regions. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) to map brain-wide functional connectivity (FC) in mice that were trained in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze. C57BL6 mice were investigated in a small animal MRI scanner following 2, 10, or 15 days of acquisition learning, or 5 days of reversal learning. Spatial learning coincided with progressive and changing FC between telencephalic regions that have been implemented in spatial learning (such as hippocampus, cingulate, visual, and motor cortex). Search strategy assessment demonstrated that the use of cognitively advanced spatial strategies correlated positively with extensive telencephalic connectivity, whereas non-spatial strategies correlated negatively with connectivity. FC patterns were different and more extensive after reversal learning compared with after extended acquisition learning, which could explain why reversal learning has been shown to be more sensitive to subtle functional defects.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ceftriaxone Treatment Preserves Cortical Inhibitory Interneuron Function via Transient Salvage of GLT-1 in a Rat Traumatic Brain Injury Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy328</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a decrease in glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) expression, the major mechanism for glutamate removal from synapses. Coupled with an increase in glutamate release from dead and dying neurons, this causes an increase in extracellular glutamate. The ensuing glutamate excitotoxicity disproportionately damages vulnerable GABAergic parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons, resulting in a progressively worsening cortical excitatory:inhibitory imbalance due to a loss of GABAergic inhibitory tone, as evidenced by chronic post-traumatic symptoms such as epilepsy, and supported by neuropathologic findings. This loss of intracortical inhibition can be measured and followed noninvasively using long-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with mechanomyography (LI-ppTMS-MMG). Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic, is a potent stimulator of the expression of rodent GLT-1 and would presumably decrease excitotoxic damage to GABAergic interneurons. It may thus be a viable antiepileptogenic intervention. Using a rat fluid percussion injury TBI model, we utilized LI-ppTMS-MMG, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry to test whether ceftriaxone treatment preserves intracortical inhibition and cortical parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneuron function after TBI in rat motor cortex. We show that neocortical GLT-1 gene and protein expression are significantly reduced 1 week after TBI, and this transient loss is mitigated by ceftriaxone. Importantly, whereas intracortical inhibition declines progressively after TBI, 1 week of post-TBI ceftriaxone treatment attenuates the loss of inhibition compared to saline-treated controls. This finding is accompanied by significantly higher parvalbumin gene and protein expression in ceftriaxone-treated injured rats. Our results highlight prospects for ceftriaxone as an intervention after TBI to prevent cortical inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, partly by preserving GLT-1 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Representations of Perceived and Retrieved Visual Information in Hippocampus and Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory retrieval is thought to depend on interactions between hippocampus and cortex, but the nature of representation in these regions and their relationship remains unclear. Here, we performed an ultra-high field fMRI (7T) experiment, comprising perception, learning and retrieval sessions. We observed a fundamental difference between representations in hippocampus and high-level visual cortex during perception and retrieval. First, while object-selective posterior fusiform cortex showed consistent responses that allowed us to decode object identity across both perception and retrieval one day after learning, object decoding in hippocampus was much stronger during retrieval than perception. Second, in visual cortex but not hippocampus, there was consistency in response patterns between perception and retrieval, suggesting that substantial neural populations are shared for both perception and retrieval. Finally, the decoding in hippocampus during retrieval was not observed when retrieval was tested on the same day as learning suggesting that the retrieval process itself is not sufficient to elicit decodable object representations. Collectively, these findings suggest that while cortical representations are stable between perception and retrieval, hippocampal representations are much stronger during retrieval, implying some form of reorganization of the representations between perception and retrieval.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Aging-Related Changes in Cognition and Cortical Integrity are Associated With Serum Expression of Candidate MicroRNAs for Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy323</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy323/5257443?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in molecular pathways responsible for aging and prevalent aging-related chronic diseases. However, the lack of research linking circulating levels of miRNAs to changes in the aging brain hampers clinical translation. Here, we have investigated if serum expression of brain-enriched miRNAs that have been proposed as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a) are also associated with cognitive functioning and changes of the cerebral cortex in normal elderly subjects. Results revealed that candidate miRNAs were linked to changes in cortical thickness (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, and miR-125b), cortical glucose metabolism (miR-29b, miR-125b, and miR-146a), and cognitive performance (miR-9, miR-34a, and miR-125b). While both miR-29b and miR-125b were related to aging-related structural and metabolic cortical changes, only expression levels of miR-125b were associated with patterns of glucose consumption shown by cortical regions that correlated with executive function. Together, these findings suggest that serum expression of AD-related miRNAs are biologically meaningful in aging and may play a role as biomarkers of cerebral vulnerability in late life.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: EphA4 Regulates Hippocampal Neural Precursor Proliferation in the Adult Mouse Brain by d-Serine Modulation of N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy319</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy319/5257446?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a major region of the adult rodent brain in which neurogenesis occurs throughout life. The EphA4 receptor, which regulates neurogenesis and boundary formation in the developing brain, is also expressed in the adult DG, but whether it regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not known. Here, we show that, in the adult mouse brain, EphA4 inhibits hippocampal precursor cell proliferation but does not affect precursor differentiation or survival. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 significantly increased hippocampal precursor proliferation &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt;, by blocking EphA4 forward signaling. EphA4 was expressed by mature hippocampal DG neurons but not neural precursor cells, and an EphA4 antagonist, EphA4-Fc, did not activate clonal cultures of precursors until they were co-cultured with non-precursor cells, indicating an indirect effect of EphA4 on the regulation of precursor activity. Supplementation with &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine blocked the increased precursor proliferation induced by EphA4 inhibition, whereas blocking the interaction between &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) promoted precursor activity, even at the clonal level. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EphA4 indirectly regulates adult hippocampal precursor proliferation and thus plays a role in neurogenesis via &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine-regulated NMDAR signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Temporal Metacognition as the Decoding of Self-Generated Brain Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy318</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy318/5257447?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metacognition, the ability to know about one’s thought process, is self-referential. Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations (β; 15–40 Hz) with increases in early β power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of β power in a low-dimensional space (β state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that β states instantiate an internal variable determining the fate of the timing network’s trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing, suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reorganization of Higher-Order Somatosensory Cortex After Sensory Loss from Hand in Squirrel Monkeys</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy317/5257449?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Unilateral dorsal column lesions (DCL) at the cervical spinal cord deprive the hand regions of somatosensory cortex of tactile activation. However, considerable cortical reactivation occurs over weeks to months of recovery. While most studies focused on the reactivation of primary somatosensory area 3b, here, for the first time, we address how the higher-order somatosensory cortex reactivates in the same monkeys after DCL that vary across cases in completeness, post-lesion recovery times, and types of treatments. We recorded neural responses to tactile stimulation in areas 3a, 3b, 1, secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and occasionally areas 2/5. Our analysis emphasized comparisons of the responsiveness, somatotopy, and receptive field size between areas 3b, 1, and S2/PV across DCL conditions and recovery times. The results indicate that the extents of the reactivation in higher-order somatosensory areas 1 and S2/PV closely reflect the reactivation in primary somatosensory cortex. Responses in higher-order areas S2 and PV can be stronger than those in area 3b, thus suggesting converging or alternative sources of inputs. The results also provide evidence that both primary and higher-order fields are effectively activated after long recovery times as well as after behavioral and electrocutaneous stimulation interventions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: erbb4 Deficits in Chandelier Cells of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Confer Cognitive Dysfunctions: Implications for Schizophrenia</title>

Chandelier cells (ChCs, also known as axo-axonic cells) are a distinct GABAergic interneuron subtype that exclusively target the axonal initial segment, which is the site of pyramidal neuron action potential initiation. ChCs are a source of ErbB4 expression and alterations in ChC-pyramidal neuron connectivity occur in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of schizophrenic patients and animal models of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of ErbB4 in mPFC ChCs to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remains unknown. By conditional deletion or knockdown of ErbB4 from mPFC ChCs, we demonstrated that ErbB4 deficits led to impaired ChC-pyramidal neuron connections and cognitive dysfunctions. Furthermore, the cognitive dysfunctions were normalized by L-838417, an agonist of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;α2 receptors enriched in the axonal initial segment. Given that cognitive dysfunctions are a core symptom of schizophrenia, our results may provide a new perspective for understanding the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;α2 receptors may be potential pharmacological targets for its treatment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Wdr1 Deficit Impairs Learning and Memory by Perturbing F-actin Depolymerization in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy301</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;WD repeat protein 1 (Wdr1), known as a cofactor of actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, is conserved among eukaryotes, and it plays a critical role in the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the function of Wdr1 in the central nervous system remains elusive. Using &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; conditional knockout mice, we demonstrated that Wdr1 plays a significant role in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory. The knockout mice exhibited altered reversal spatial learning and fear responses. Moreover, the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; CKO mice showed significant abnormalities in spine morphology and synaptic function, including enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation and impaired long-term depression. Furthermore, we observed that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; deficiency perturbed actin rearrangement through regulation of the ADF/cofilin activity. Taken together, these results indicate that Wdr1 in the hippocampal CA1 area plays a critical role in actin dynamics in associative learning and postsynaptic receptor availability.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Circuit Models of Low-Dimensional Shared Variability in Cortical Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31043-2?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Population-wide fluctuations of neural population activity are widely observed in cortical recordings. Huang et al. show that turbulent dynamics in spatially ordered recurrent networks give rise to low-dimensional shared variability, which can be suppressed by depolarizing inhibitory neurons.</description>
