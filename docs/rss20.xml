West Nile virus (WNV)—a mosquito-borne arbovirus—entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential—short-range dispersal, 2) power-law—long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction —long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9rfZ0tOoEtc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Perceived target range shapes human sound-localization behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The auditory system relies on binaural differences and spectral pinna cues to localize sounds in azimuth and elevation. However, the acoustic input can be unreliable, due to uncertainty about the environment, and neural noise. A possible strategy to reduce sound-location uncertainty is to integrate the sensory observations with sensorimotor information from previous experience, to infer where sounds are more likely to occur. We investigated whether and how human sound localization performance is affected by the spatial distribution of target sounds, and changes thereof. We tested three different open-loop paradigms, in which we varied the spatial range of sounds in different ways. For the narrowest ranges, target-response gains were highly idiosyncratic and deviated from an optimal gain predicted by error-minimization; in the horizontal plane the deviation typically consisted of a response overshoot. Moreover, participants adjusted their behavior by rapidly adapting their gain to the target range, both in elevation and in azimuth, yielding behavior closer to optimal for larger target ranges. Notably, gain changes occurred without any exogenous feedback about performance. We discuss how the findings can be explained by a sub-optimal model in which the motor-control system reduces its response error across trials to within an acceptable range – rather than strictly minimizing the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Sensory observations can be noisy, leading to uncertainty in perceptual inferences and variable estimation errors. Theoretically, to reduce uncertainty, sensory information could be integrated with knowledge from prior experience, and with feedback about one’s own response behavior. Here we show, that for a basic and accurate sensorimotor task such as sound localization, humans indeed rely on perceived experience in the absence of exogenous feedback, as they rapidly changed their response sensitivity to experimental variations in the spatial distribution of targets. We argue that the auditory system reduces its estimated localization error close to its expected minimum across trials, allowing for idiosyncratic sub-optimal target response gains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: LDB1 Is Required for the Early Development of the Dorsal Telencephalon and the Thalamus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1) is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from embryonic day (E)10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed &lt;i&gt;Lhx2&lt;/i&gt; line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long-Term, Targeted Delivery of GDNF from Encapsulated Cells Is Neuroprotective and Reduces Seizures in the Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2144?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors are candidates for treating epilepsy, but their development has been hampered by difficulties in achieving stable and targeted delivery of efficacious concentrations within the desired brain region. We have developed an encapsulated cell technology that overcomes these obstacles by providing a targeted, continuous, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesized source of high levels of neurotrophic molecules from human clonal ARPE-19 cells encapsulated into hollow fiber membranes. Here we illustrate the potential of this approach for delivering glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) directly to the hippocampus of epileptic rats. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated that bilateral intrahippocampal implants continued to secrete GDNF that produced high hippocampal GDNF tissue levels in a long-term manner. Identical implants robustly reduced seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model. Seizures were reduced rapidly, and this effect increased in magnitude over 3 months, ultimately leading to a reduction of seizures by 93%. This effect persisted even after device removal, suggesting potential disease-modifying benefits. Importantly, seizure reduction was associated with normalized changes in anxiety and improved cognitive performance. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the neurological benefits of GDNF were associated with the normalization of anatomical alterations accompanying chronic epilepsy, including hippocampal atrophy, cell degeneration, loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and abnormal neurogenesis. These effects were associated with the activation of GDNF receptors. All in all, these results support the concept that the implantation of encapsulated GDNF-secreting cells can deliver GDNF in a sustained, targeted, and efficacious manner, paving the way for continuing preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical translation of this approach for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting millions of individuals of all ages. These patients experience debilitating seizures that frequently increase over time and can associate with significant cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders that are generally poorly controlled by pharmacotherapy. We have developed a clinically validated, implantable cell encapsulation system that delivers high and consistent levels of GDNF directly to the brain. In epileptic animals, this system produced a progressive and permanent reduction (&amp;gt;90%) in seizure frequency. These benefits were accompanied by improvements in cognitive and anxiolytic behavior and the normalization of changes in CNS anatomy that underlie chronic epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a novel means of tackling the frequently intractable neurological consequences of this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MicroRNA-1224 Splicing CircularRNA-Filip1l in an Ago2-Dependent Manner Regulates Chronic Inflammatory Pain via Targeting Ubr5</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctions of gene transcription and translation in the nociceptive pathways play the critical role in development and maintenance of chronic pain. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression, but whether and how circRNAs are involved in chronic pain remain elusive. We showed here that complete Freund's adjuvant-induced chronic inflammation pain significantly increased circRNA-Filip1l (filamin A interacting protein 1-like) expression in spinal neurons of mice. Blockage of this increase attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant-induced nociceptive behaviors, and overexpression of spinal circRNA-Filip1l in naive mice mimicked the nociceptive behaviors as evidenced by decreased thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore, we found that mature circRNA-Filip1l expression was negatively regulated by miRNA-1224 via binding and splicing of precursor of circRNA-Filip1l (pre-circRNA-Filip1l) in the Argonaute-2 (&lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt;)-dependent manner. Increase of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression resulted from the decrease of miRNA-1224 expression under chronic inflammation pain state. miRNA-1224 knockdown or &lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt; overexpression induced nociceptive behaviors in naive mice, which was prevented by the knockdown of spinal circRNA-Filip1l. Finally, we demonstrated that a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-recognin 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;), validated as a target of circRNA-Filip1l, plays a pivotal role in regulation of nociception by spinal circRNA-Filip1l. These data suggest that miRNA-1224-mediated and Ago2-dependent modulation of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression regulates nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; circRNAs are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression. Here, we found that the increase of circRNA-Filip1l mediated by miRNA-1224 in an Ago2-dependent way in the spinal cord is involved in regulation of nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;. Our study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurons in FEF Keep Track of Items That Have Been Previously Fixated in Free Viewing Visual Search</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2114?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2114?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When searching a visual scene for a target, we tend not to look at items or locations we have already searched. It is thought that this behavior is driven by an inhibitory tagging mechanism that inhibits responses on priority maps to the relevant items. We hypothesized that this inhibitory tagging signal should be represented as an elevated response in neurons that keep track of stimuli that have been fixated. We recorded from 231 neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) of 2 male animals performing a visual foraging task, in which they had to find a reward linked to one of five identical targets (Ts) among five distractors. We identified 38 neurons with activity that was significantly greater when the stimulus in the receptive field had been fixated previously in the trial than when it had not been fixated. The response to a fixated object began before the saccade ended, suggesting that this information is remapped. Unlike most FEF neurons, the activity in these cells was not suppressed during active fixation, had minimal motor responses, and did not change through the trial. Yet using traditional classifications from a memory-guided saccade, they were indistinguishable from the rest of the FEF population. We propose that these neurons keep track of any items that have been fixated within the trial and this signal is propagated by remapping. These neurons could be the source of the inhibitory tagging signal to parietal cortex, where a neuronal instantiation of inhibitory tagging is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When we search a scene for an item, we rarely examine the same location twice. It is thought that this is due to a neural mechanism that keeps track of the items at which we have looked. Here we identified a subset of neurons in the frontal eye field that preferentially responded to items that had been fixated earlier in the trial. These responses were remapped, appearing before the saccade even ended, and were not suppressed during maintained fixation. We propose that these neurons keep track of which items have been examined in search and could be the source of feedback that creates the inhibitory tagging seen in parietal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural Thalamofrontal Hypoconnectivity Is Related to Oculomotor Corollary Discharge Dysfunction in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2102?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;By predicting sensory consequences of actions, humans can distinguish self-generated sensory inputs from those that are elicited externally. This is one mechanism by which we achieve a subjective sense of agency over our actions. Corollary discharge (CD) signals—&quot;copies&quot; of motor signals sent to sensory areas—permit such predictions, and CD abnormalities are a hypothesized mechanism for the agency disruptions in schizophrenia that characterize a subset of symptoms. Indeed, behavioral evidence of altered CD, including in the oculomotor system, has been observed in schizophrenia patients. A pathway projecting from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye fields (FEFs) via the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) conveys oculomotor CD associated with saccadic eye movements in nonhuman primates. This animal work provides a promising translational framework in which to investigate CD abnormalities in clinical populations. In the current study, we examined whether structural connectivity of this MD–FEF pathway relates to oculomotor CD functioning in schizophrenia. Twenty-two schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy control participants of both sexes underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and a large subset performed a trans-saccadic perceptual task that yields measures of CD. Using probabilistic tractography, we identified anatomical connections between FEF and MD and extracted indices of microstructural integrity. Patients exhibited compromised microstructural integrity in the MD–FEF pathway, which was correlated with greater oculomotor CD abnormalities and more severe psychotic symptoms. These data reinforce the role of the MD–FEF pathway in transmitting oculomotor CD signals and suggest that disturbances in this pathway may relate to psychotic symptom manifestation in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with schizophrenia sometimes experience abnormalities in a sense of agency, which may stem from abnormal sensory predictions about their own actions. Consistent with this notion, the current study found reduced structural connectivity in patients with schizophrenia in a specific brain pathway found to transmit such sensorimotor prediction signals in nonhuman primates. Reduced structural connectivity was correlated with behavioral evidence for impaired sensorimotor predictions and psychotic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in Both Neuron Intrinsic Properties and Neurotransmission Are Needed to Drive the Increase in GnRH Neuron Firing Rate during Estradiol-Positive Feedback</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2091?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Central output of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons controls fertility and is sculpted by sex-steroid feedback. A switch of estradiol action from negative to positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH release, culminating in ovulation. In ovariectomized mice bearing constant-release estradiol implants (OVX+E), GnRH neuron firing is suppressed in the morning (AM) by negative feedback and activated in the afternoon (PM) by positive feedback; no time-of-day-dependent changes occur in OVX mice. In this daily surge model, GnRH neuron intrinsic properties are shifted to favor increased firing during positive feedback. It is unclear whether this shift and the observed concomitant increase in GABAergic transmission, which typically excites GnRH neurons, are independently sufficient for increasing GnRH neuron firing rate during positive feedback or whether both are needed. To test this, we used dynamic clamp to inject selected previously recorded trains of GABAergic postsynaptic conductances (PSgs) collected during the different feedback states of the daily surge model into GnRH neurons from OVX, OVX+E AM, and OVX+E PM mice. PSg trains mimicking positive feedback initiated more action potentials in cells from OVX+E PM mice than negative feedback or OVX (open feedback loop) trains in all three animal models, but the positive-feedback train was most effective when applied to cells during positive feedback. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; studies of model GnRH neurons in which &amp;gt;1000 PSg trains were tested exhibited the same results. These observations support the hypothesis that GnRH neurons integrate fast-synaptic and intrinsic changes to increase firing rates during positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Ovarian estradiol alters both the intrinsic properties of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and synaptic inputs to these cells coincident with production of sustained GnRH release that ultimately triggers ovulation. We demonstrate here using dynamic clamp and mathematical modeling that estradiol-induced shifts in synaptic transmission alone can increase firing output, but that the intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons during positive feedback further poise these cells for increased response to higher frequency synaptic transmission. These data suggest that GnRH neurons integrate fast-synaptic and intrinsic changes to increase firing rates during the preovulatory GnRH surge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) Neurons Act Locally to Modulate Frontostriatal Cognition and Circuit Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2080?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The PFC and extended frontostriatal circuitry support higher cognitive processes that guide goal-directed behavior. PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of multiple psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, a major limiting factor in the development of treatments for PFC cognitive dysfunction is our limited understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying PFC-dependent cognition. We recently demonstrated that activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors in the caudal dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) impairs higher cognitive function, as measured in a working memory task. Currently, there remains much unknown about CRF-dependent regulation of cognition, including the source of CRF for cognition-modulating receptors and the output pathways modulated by these receptors. To address these issues, the current studies used a viral vector-based approach to chemogenetically activate or inhibit PFC CRF neurons in working memory-tested male rats. Chemogenetic activation of caudal, but not rostral, dmPFC CRF neurons potently impaired working memory, whereas inhibition of these neurons improved working memory. Importantly, the cognition-impairing actions of PFC CRF neurons were dependent on local CRF receptors coupled to protein kinase A. Additional electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of caudal dmPFC CRF neurons elicits a robust degradation of task-related coding properties of dmPFC pyramidal neurons and, to a lesser extent, medium spiny neurons in the dorsomedial striatum. Collectively, these results demonstrate that local CRF release within the caudal dmPFC impairs frontostriatal cognitive and circuit function and suggest that CRF may represent a potential target for treating frontostriatal cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dorsomedial PFC and its striatal targets play a critical role in higher cognitive function. PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction is associated with many psychiatric disorders. Although it has long-been known that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons are prominent within the PFC, their role in cognition has remained unclear. Using a novel chemogenetic viral vector system, the present studies demonstrate that PFC CRF neurons impair working memory via activation of local PKA-coupled CRF receptors, an action associated with robust degradation in task-related frontostriatal neuronal coding. Conversely, suppression of constitutive PFC CRF activity improved working memory. Collectively, these studies provide novel insight into the neurobiology of cognition and suggest that CRF may represent a novel target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is strong evidence that spinoparabrachial neurons in the superficial dorsal horn contribute to persistent pain states, and that the lateral parabrachial complex (PB) conveys relevant nociceptive information to higher structures. The role of PB itself in hyperalgesia and how it recruits descending facilitation has nevertheless received significantly less attention. The current study is a first step toward delineating the functional dynamics of PB and its link to descending control in acute and persistent inflammatory pain. In lightly anesthetized rats, we recorded behavioral withdrawal evoked by mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw and, simultaneously, the activity of identified pain-modulating neurons, &quot;ON-cells&quot; and &quot;OFF-cells,&quot; in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). This was done before and after the inactivation of PB, contralateral or ipsilateral to an inflamed paw [1 h, 1 d, or 5–6 d after intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)]. The inactivation of contralateral, but not ipsilateral, PB interfered with nociceptive input to RVM under basal conditions, as well as in acute inflammation. By contrast, blocking ipsilateral, but not contralateral, PB in established inflammation interfered with behavioral hyperalgesia and ON-cell and OFF-cell responses. The lesioning of contralateral PB before CFA injection prevented this recruitment of ipsilateral PB in persistent inflammation. These experiments show that contralateral PB is required to initiate hyperalgesia, which is then maintained by ipsilateral PB, most likely in both cases via the engagement of pain-modulating neurons of the RVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral parabrachial complex (PB) relays nociceptive information to brain circuits that are important for the transmission and modulation of pain, but its specific role in persistent pain and engagement of descending control mechanisms has received relatively little attention. We show here that PB contralateral and ipsilateral to an inflammatory insult demonstrate different functions as inflammation persists, likely by engaging pain-facilitating neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla. While the contralateral PB, the target of the major spinoparabrachial pathway, relays acute nociceptive information, the ipsilateral PB is recruited or unmasked in persistent inflammation to maintain hyperalgesia. These data point to plasticity in the PB itself or its direct and indirect connections with pain-modulating systems as central to the development and maintenance of persistent pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Superficial Layers Suppress the Deep Layers to Fine-tune Cortical Coding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2052?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The descending microcircuit from layer 2/3 (L2/3) to layer 5 (L5) is one of the strongest excitatory pathways in the cortex, presumably forming a core component of its feedforward hierarchy. To date, however, no experiments have selectively tested the impact of L2/3 activity on L5 during active sensation. We used optogenetic, cell-type-specific manipulation of L2/3 neurons in the barrel cortex of actively sensing mice (of either sex) to elucidate the significance of this pathway to sensory coding in L5. Contrary to standard models, activating L2/3 predominantly suppressed spontaneous activity in L5, whereas deactivating L2/3 mainly facilitated touch responses in L5. Somatostatin interneurons are likely important to this suppression because their optogenetic deactivation significantly altered the functional impact of L2/3 onto L5. The net effect of L2/3 was to enhance the stimulus selectivity and expand the range of L5 output. These data imply that the core cortical pathway increases the selectivity and expands the range of cortical output through feedforward inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The primary sensory cortex contains six distinct layers that interact to form the basis of our perception. While rudimentary patterns of connectivity between the layers have been outlined quite extensively &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, functional relationships &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, particularly during active sensation, remain poorly understood. We used cell-type-specific optogenetics to test the functional relationship between layer 2/3 and layer 5. Surprisingly, we discovered that L2/3 primarily suppresses cortical output from L5. The recruitment of somatostatin-positive interneurons is likely fundamental to this relationship. The net effect of this translaminar suppression is to enhance the selectivity and expand the range of receptive fields, therefore potentially sharpening the perception of space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventral Pallidum Is the Primary Target for Accumbens D1 Projections Driving Cocaine Seeking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2041?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2041?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Outputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) include projections to the ventral pallidum and the ventral tegmental area and subtantia nigra in the ventral mesencephalon. The medium spiny neurons (MSN) that give rise to these pathways are GABAergic and consist of two populations of equal number that are segregated by differentially expressed proteins, including D1- and D2-dopamine receptors. Afferents to the ventral pallidum arise from both D1- and D2-MSNs, whereas the ventral mesencephalon is selectively innervated by D1-MSN. To determine the extent of collateralization of D1-MSN to these axon terminal fields we used retrograde labeling in transgenic mice expressing tdTomato selectively in D1-MSN, and found that a large majority of D1-MSN in either the shell or core subcompartments of the accumbens collateralized to both output structures. Approximately 70% of D1-MSNs projecting to the ventral pallidum collateralized to the ventral mesencephalon, whereas &amp;gt;90% of mesencephalic D1-MSN afferents collateralized to the ventral pallidum. In contrast, &amp;lt;10% of dorsal striatal D1-MSNs collateralized to both the globus pallidus and ventral mesencephalon. D1-MSN activation is required for conditioned cues to induce cocaine seeking. To determine which D1-MSN projection mediates cued cocaine seeking, we selectively transfected D1-MSNs in transgenic rats with an inhibitory Gi-coupled DREADD. Activation of the transfected Gi-DREADD with clozapine-N-oxide administered into the ventral pallidum, but not into the ventral mesencephalon, blocked cue-induced cocaine seeking. These data show that, although accumbens D1-MSNs largely collateralize to both the ventral pallidum and ventral mesencephalon, only D1-MSN innervation of the ventral pallidum is necessary for cue-induced cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activity in D1 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc is required for rodents to respond to cocaine-conditioned cues and relapse to drug seeking behaviors. The D1-expressing neurons project to both the ventral pallidum and ventral mesencephalon, and we found that a majority of the neurons that innervate the ventral pallidum also collateralize to the ventral mesencephalon. However, despite innervating both structures, only D1 innervation of the ventral pallidum mediates cue-induced cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Complement Targets Newborn Retinal Ganglion Cells for Phagocytic Elimination by Microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2025?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia play important roles in shaping the developing CNS, and at early stages they have been proposed to regulate progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal survival. However, these studies reveal contradictory outcomes, highlighting the complexity of these cell–cell interactions. Here, we investigate microglia function during embryonic mouse retina development, where only microglia, progenitors, and neurons are present. In both sexes, we determine that microglia primarily interact with retinal neurons and find that depletion of microglia via conditional KO of the &lt;i&gt;Csf1&lt;/i&gt; receptor results in increased density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Pharmacological inhibition of microglia also results in an increase in RGCs, with no effect on retinal progenitor proliferation, RGC genesis, or apoptosis. We show that microglia in the embryonic retina are enriched for phagocytic markers and observe engulfment of nonapoptotic Brn3-labeled RGCs. We investigate the molecular pathways that can mediate cell engulfment by microglia and find selective downregulation of complement pathway components with microglia inhibition, and further show that C1q protein marks a subset of RGCs in the embryonic retina. KO of complement receptor 3 (&lt;i&gt;CR3; Itgam&lt;/i&gt;), which is only expressed by microglia, results in increased RGC density, similar to what we observed after depletion or inhibition of microglia. Thus, our data suggest that microglia regulate neuron elimination in the embryonic mouse retina by complement-mediated phagocytosis of non-apoptotic newborn RGCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia are emerging as active and important participants in regulating neuron number in development, during adult neurogenesis, and following stem cell therapies. However, their role in these contexts and the mechanisms involved are not fully defined. Using a well-characterized &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system, we provide evidence that microglia regulate neuronal elimination by complement-mediated engulfment of nonapoptotic neurons. This work provides a significant advancement of the field by defining &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; molecular mechanisms for microglia-mediated cell elimination. Our data add to a growing body of evidence that microglia are essential for proper nervous system development. In addition, we elucidate microglia function in the developing retina, which may shed light on microglia involvement in the context of retinal injury and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Knockdown of Fidgetin Improves Regeneration of Injured Axons by a Microtubule-Based Mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2011?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2011?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fidgetin is a microtubule-severing protein that pares back the labile domains of microtubules in the axon. Experimental depletion of fidgetin results in elongation of the labile domains of microtubules and faster axonal growth. To test whether &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown assists axonal regeneration, we plated dissociated adult rat DRGs transduced using AAV5-shRNA-&lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; on a laminin substrate with spots of aggrecan, a growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This cell culture assay mimics the glial scar formed after CNS injury. Aggrecan is more concentrated at the edge of the spot, such that axons growing from within the spot toward the edge encounter a concentration gradient that causes growth cones to become dystrophic and axons to retract or curve back on themselves. &lt;i&gt;Fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown resulted in faster-growing axons on both laminin and aggrecan and enhanced crossing of axons from laminin onto aggrecan. Strikingly, axons from within the spot grew more avidly against the inhibitory aggrecan concentration gradient to cross onto laminin, without retracting or curving back. We also tested whether depleting fidgetin improves axonal regeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; after a dorsal root crush in adult female rats. Whereas control DRG neurons failed to extend axons across the dorsal root entry zone after injury, DRG neurons in which &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; was knocked down displayed enhanced regeneration of axons across the dorsal root entry zone into the spinal cord. Collectively, these results establish fidgetin as a novel therapeutic target to augment nerve regeneration and provide a workflow template by which microtubule-related targets can be compared in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we establish a workflow template from cell culture to animals in which microtubule-based treatments can be tested and compared with one another for their effectiveness in augmenting regeneration of injured axons relevant to spinal cord injury. The present work uses a viral transduction approach to knock down &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; from rat neurons, which coaxes nerve regeneration by elevating microtubule mass in their axons. Unlike previous strategies using microtubule-stabilizing drugs, &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown adds microtubule mass that is labile (rather than stable), thereby better recapitulating the growth status of a developing axon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cenpj Regulates Cilia Disassembly and Neurogenesis in the Developing Mouse Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1994?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1994?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Primary cilia are microtubule-based protuberances that project from the eukaryotic cell body to sense the extracellular environment. Ciliogenesis is closely correlated to the cell cycle and defects of cilia are related to human systemic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the role of ciliogenesis in cortical development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Cenpj, a protein that is required for centriole biogenesis, plays a role in regulating cilium disassembly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Depletion of Cenpj in neural progenitor cells results in long cilia and abnormal cilia disassembly. Radial glial cells Cenpj depletion exhibit uncompleted cell division, reduced cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis in the developing mouse cerebrum cortex, leading to microcephaly. In addition, Cenpj depletion causes long and thin primary cilia and motile cilia in adult neural stem cells and reduced cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Furthermore, we show that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, a plus-end-directed motor protein. These data collected from mice of both sexes provide insights into how ciliogenesis plays roles in cortical development and how primary microcephaly is induced by &lt;i&gt;Cenpj&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder with the major symptoms of reduction of circumference of the head, brain volume, and cortex thickness with normal brain architecture in birth. We used conditional Cenpj deletion mice and found that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibited long primary cilia and abnormal cilium appendages. The defective cilium disassembly caused by Cenpj depletion might correlate to reduced cell proliferation, uncompleted cell division, cell apoptosis, and microcephaly in mice. Cenpj also regulates the cilium structure of adult neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis in mice. Additionally, our results illustrate that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, indicating that primary cilia dynamics play a crucial role in NPC mitosis and adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of Dopamine Receptor 2 Prompts Transcriptomic and Metabolic Plasticity in Glioblastoma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types. Evidence continues to accrue indicating that the complex relationship between GBM and the brain microenvironment contributes to this malignant phenotype. However, the interaction between GBM and neurotransmitters, signaling molecules involved in neuronal communication, remains incompletely understood. Here we examined, using human patient-derived xenograft lines, how the monoamine dopamine influences GBM cells. We demonstrate that GBM cells express dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), with elevated expression in the glioma-initiating cell (GIC) population. Stimulation of DRD2 caused a neuron-like hyperpolarization exclusively in GICs. In addition, long-term activation of DRD2 heightened the sphere-forming capacity of GBM cells, as well as tumor engraftment efficiency in both male and female mice. Mechanistic investigation revealed that DRD2 signaling activates the hypoxia response and functionally alters metabolism. Finally, we found that GBM cells synthesize and secrete dopamine themselves, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. These results identify dopamine signaling as a potential therapeutic target in GBM and further highlight neurotransmitters as a key feature of the pro-tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work offers critical insight into the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the progression of GBM. We show that dopamine induces specific changes in the state of tumor cells, augmenting their growth and shifting them to a more stem-cell like state. Further, our data illustrate that dopamine can alter the metabolic behavior of GBM cells, increasing glycolysis. Finally, this work demonstrates that GBM cells, including tumor samples from patients, can synthesize and secrete dopamine, suggesting an autocrine signaling process underlying these results. These results describe a novel connection between neurotransmitters and brain cancer, further highlighting the critical influence of the brain milieu on GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Two Distinct Sets of Ca2+ and K+ Channels Are Activated at Different Membrane Potentials by the Climbing Fiber Synaptic Potential in Purkinje Neuron Dendrites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1969?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In cerebellar Purkinje neuron dendrites, the transient depolarization associated with a climbing fiber (CF) EPSP activates voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGCCs), voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGKCs), and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated SK and BK K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. The resulting membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients play a fundamental role in dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity of parallel fiber inputs. Here we report a detailed investigation of the kinetics of dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels activated by CF-EPSPs, based on optical measurements of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients and on a single-compartment NEURON model reproducing experimental data. We first measured &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients associated with CF-EPSPs at different initial &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, and we analyzed the changes in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients produced by the block of each individual VGCCs, of A-type VGKCs and of SK and BK channels. Then, we constructed a model that includes six active ion channels to accurately match experimental signals and extract the physiological kinetics of each channel. We found that two different sets of channels are selectively activated. When the dendrite is hyperpolarized, CF-EPSPs mainly activate T-type VGCCs, SK channels, and A-type VGKCs that limit the transient &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ~ &amp;lt;0 mV. In contrast, when the dendrite is depolarized, T-type VGCCs and A-type VGKCs are inactivated and CF-EPSPs activate P/Q-type VGCCs, high-voltage activated VGKCs, and BK channels, leading to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes. Thus, the potentially activity-dependent regulation of A-type VGKCs, controlling the activation of this second set of channels, is likely to play a crucial role in signal integration and plasticity in Purkinje neuron dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The climbing fiber synaptic input transiently depolarizes the dendrite of cerebellar Purkinje neurons generating a signal that plays a fundamental role in dendritic integration. This signal is mediated by two types of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and four types of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Thus, understanding the kinetics of all of these channels is crucial for understanding PN function. To obtain this information, we used an innovative strategy that merges ultrafast optical membrane potential and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; measurements, pharmacological analysis, and computational modeling. We found that, according to the initial membrane potential, the climbing fiber depolarizing transient activates two distinct sets of channels. Moreover, A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels limit the activation of P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and associated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, thus preventing the generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In response to altered neuronal energy state, mitochondria adapt to enable energy homeostasis and nervous system function. This adaptation, also called mitochondrial plasticity, can be observed as alterations in the form, function and position. The primary site of energy consumption in neurons is localized at the synapse, where mitochondria are critical for both pre- and postsynaptic functions. In this review, we will discuss molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial plasticity at the synapse and how they contribute to information processing within neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Emergence of Brain Rhythms: Model Interpretation of EEG Data. (arXiv:1903.04576v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) monitors ---by either intrusive or noninvasive
electrodes--- time and frequency variations and spectral content of voltage
fluctuations or waves, known as brain rhythms, which in some way uncover
activity during both rest periods and specific events in which the subject is
under stimulus. This is a useful tool to explore brain behavior, as it
complements imaging techniques that have a poorer temporal resolution. We here
approach the understanding of EEG data from first principles by studying a
networked model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons which generates a variety
of comparable waves. In fact, we thus reproduce $\alpha$, $\beta,$ $\gamma$ and
other rhythms as observed by EEG, and identify the details of the respectively
involved complex phenomena, including a precise relationship between an input
and the collective response to it. It ensues the potentiality of our model to
better understand actual mind mechanisms and its possible disorders, and we
also describe kind of stochastic resonance phenomena which locate main
qualitative changes of mental behavior in (e.g.) humans. We also discuss the
plausible use of these findings to design deep learning algorithms to detect
the occurence of phase transitions in the brain and to analyse its
consequences.

	<description>Regeneration occurs at many different levels in nature, from individual organisms (notably earthworms and hydra), through communities of microbes, to ecosystems such as forests. Researchers in the life sciences and the history and philosophy of science are collaborating to explore how the processes of repair and recovery observed at these different scales are related.</description>

	<description>The characteristic properties of stem cells – notably their ability to self-renew and to differentiate – have meant that they have traditionally been viewed as distinct from most other types of cells. However, recent research has blurred the line between stem cells and other cells by showing that the former display a range of behaviors in different tissues and at different stages of development. Here, we use the tools of metaphysics to describe a classification scheme for stem cells, and to highlight what their inherent diversity means for cancer treatment.</description>

	<description>Synthetic cells spark intriguing questions about the nature of life. Projects such as BaSyC (Building a Synthetic Cell) aim to build an entity that mimics how living cells work. But what kind of entity would a synthetic cell really be? I assess this question from a philosophical perspective, and show how early fictional narratives of artificial life – such as the laboratory scene in Goethe’s &lt;i&gt;Faust&lt;/i&gt; – can help us to understand the challenges faced by synthetic biology researchers.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Impaired ABCA1/ABCG1-mediated lipid efflux in the mouse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) leads to retinal degeneration</title>

	<description>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the retina leading to loss of central vision. Polymorphisms in genes involved in lipid metabolism, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (&lt;i&gt;ABCA1&lt;/i&gt;), have been associated with AMD risk. However, the significance of retinal lipid handling for AMD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we study the contribution of lipid efflux in the RPE by generating a mouse model lacking ABCA1 and its partner ABCG1 specifically in this layer. Mutant mice show lipid accumulation in the RPE, reduced RPE and retinal function, retinal inflammation and RPE/photoreceptor degeneration. Data from human cell lines indicate that the &lt;i&gt;ABCA1&lt;/i&gt; AMD risk-conferring allele decreases &lt;i&gt;ABCA1&lt;/i&gt; expression, identifying the potential molecular cause that underlies the genetic risk for AMD. Our results highlight the essential homeostatic role for lipid efflux in the RPE and suggest a pathogenic contribution of reduced ABCA1 function to AMD.</description>

	<description>Scientists seek to eliminate all forms of bias from their research. However, all scientists also make assumptions of a non-empirical nature about topics such as causality, determinism and reductionism when conducting research. Here, we argue that since these 'philosophical biases' cannot be avoided, they need to be debated critically by scientists and philosophers of science.</description>

	<description>Linking interindividual differences in psychological phenotype to variations in brain structure is an old dream for psychology and a crucial question for cognitive neurosciences. Yet, replicability of the previously-reported 'structural brain behavior' (SBB)-associations has been questioned, recently. Here, we conducted an empirical investigation, assessing replicability of SBB among heathy adults. For a wide range of psychological measures, the replicability of associations with gray matter volume was assessed. Our results revealed that among healthy individuals 1) finding an association between performance at standard psychological tests and brain morphology is relatively unlikely 2) significant associations, found using an exploratory approach, have overestimated effect sizes and 3) can hardly be replicated in an independent sample. After considering factors such as sample size and comparing our findings with more replicable SBB-associations in a clinical cohort and replicable associations between brain structure and non-psychological phenotype, we discuss the potential causes and consequences of these findings.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 cooperates with the unfolded protein response to promote ER stress resistance</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43244</link>
	<description>Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which enhances protein folding to restore homeostasis. Additional pathways respond to ER stress, but how they help counteract protein misfolding is incompletely understood. Here, we develop a titratable system for the induction of ER stress in yeast to enable a genetic screen for factors that augment stress resistance independently of the UPR. We identify the proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 and show that it cooperates with the UPR. Rpn4 abundance increases during ER stress, first by a post-transcriptional, then by a transcriptional mechanism. Induction of &lt;i&gt;RPN4&lt;/i&gt; transcription is triggered by cytosolic mislocalization of secretory proteins, is mediated by multiple signaling pathways and accelerates clearance of misfolded proteins from the cytosol. Thus, Rpn4 and the UPR are complementary elements of a modular cross-compartment response to ER stress.</description>

	<description>PSD-95 MAGUK family scaffold proteins are multi-domain organisers of synaptic transmission that contain three PDZ domains followed by an SH3-GK domain tandem. This domain architecture allows coordinated assembly of protein complexes composed of neurotransmitter receptors, synaptic adhesion molecules and downstream signalling effectors. Here we show that binding of monomeric CRIPT-derived PDZ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 induces functional changes in the intramolecular SH3-GK domain assembly that influence subsequent homotypic and heterotypic complex formation. We identify PSD-95 interactors that differentially bind to the SH3-GK domain tandem depending on its conformational state. Among these interactors we further establish the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gnb5 as a PSD-95 complex partner at dendritic spines of rat hippocampal neurons. The PSD-95 GK domain binds to Gnb5 and this interaction is triggered by CRIPT-derived PDZ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands binding to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, unraveling a hierarchical binding mechanism of PSD-95 complex formation.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38114</link>
	<description>Sleep-like states in diverse organisms can be separated into distinct stages, each with a characteristic arousal threshold. However, the molecular pathways underlying different sleep stages remain unclear. The fruit fly, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, exhibits consolidated sleep during both day and night, with night sleep associated with higher arousal thresholds compared to day sleep. Here we identify a role for the neuronal calcium sensor protein Neurocalcin (NCA) in promoting sleep during the night but not the day by suppressing nocturnal arousal and hyperactivity. We show that both circadian and light-sensing pathways define the temporal window in which NCA promotes sleep. Furthermore, we find that NCA promotes sleep by suppressing synaptic release from a dispersed wake-promoting neural network and demonstrate that the mushroom bodies, a sleep-regulatory center, are a module within this network. Our results advance the understanding of how sleep stages are genetically defined.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effect of Interpopulation Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Synchronized Rhythms in Neuronal Networks with Inhibitory and Excitatory Populations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576314v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576314v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We consider clustered small-world networks (SWNs) with two inhibitory (I) and excitatory (E) populations. This I-E neuronal network has adaptive dynamic I to E and E to I interpopulation synaptic strengths, governed by interpopulation spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) [i.e., I to E inhibitory STDP (iSTDP) and E to I excitatory STDP (eSTDP)]. In previous works without STDPs, fast sparsely synchronized rhythms, related to diverse cognitive functions, were found to appear in a range of noise intensity D for static synaptic strengths. Here, by varying D, we investigate the effect of interpopulation STDPs on diverse population and individual properties of synchronized rhythms that emerge in the I- and the E-populations. Depending on values of D, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) for population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation synaptic strengths are found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of population synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate D, the degree of good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while in a region of large D, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of D (including the intermediate and the large D regions). This kind of &quot;equalization effect&quot; is found to occur via cooperative interplay between the average occupation and pacing degrees of synchronized rhythms. Furthermore, such equalization effect is much more enhanced in the presence of combined I to E and E to I STDPs when compared with the case of individual I to E or E to I STDP. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic plasticity is in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse). Moreover, emergences of LTP and LTD of interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times.</description>

	<description>Recent findings indicate that timing perception is systematically changed after only a single presentation of temporal asynchrony. This effect is known as rapid recalibration. In the synchrony judgement task, similar timing relationships in consecutive trials seem more synchronous (positive rapid recalibration; Van der Burg et al., 2013, 2015). Interestingly, the direction of this effect is reversed for temporal order judgements (negative rapid recalibration; Roseboom, 2019). We aimed to determine whether negative rapid recalibration of temporal order judgements (TOJs) reflects genuine rapid temporal recalibration, or a choice-repetition bias unrelated to timing perception. In our first experiment we found no evidence of rapid recalibration of TOJs, but positive rapid recalibration of associated confidence. This suggests that timing perception had rapidly recalibrated, but that this was undetectable in TOJs, plausibly because the positive recalibration effect was obfuscated by a large negative bias effect. In our second experiment, we dissociated participants' previous TOJ from the most recently presented timing relationship, mitigating the choice-repetition bias effect, and found evidence of positive rapid recalibration of TOJs. We therefore conclude that timing perception is rapidly recalibrated positively for both synchrony and temporal order judgements. It remains unclear whether rapid recalibration occurs at the level of sensory processing, leading to similar effects in all subsequent judgements, or reflects a generalised decision-making strategy.</description>

	<description>Humans cognition exhibits a striking degree of variability: Sometimes we rapidly forge new associations whereas at others new information simply does not stick. Although strong correlations between neural activity during encoding and subsequent retrieval performance have implicated such &quot;subsequent memory effects&quot; (SMEs) as important for understanding the neural basis of memory formation, uncontrolled variability in external factors that also predict memory performance confounds the interpretation of these effects. By controlling for a comprehensive set of external variables, we investigated the extent to which neural correlates of successful memory encoding reflect variability in endogenous brain states. We show that external variables that reliably predict memory performance have only minimal effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of successful memory encoding. Instead, the brain activity that is diagnostic of successful encoding primarily reflects fluctuations in endogenous neural activity. These findings link neural activity during learning to endogenous states that drive variability in human cognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Looking for a reference for large datasets: relative reliability of visual and automatic sleep scoring</title>

	<description>Study Objectives: New challenges in sleep science require to describe fine grain phenomena or to deal with large datasets. Beside the human resource challenge of scoring huge datasets, the inter- and intra-expert variability may also reduce the sensitivity of such studies. Searching for a way to disentangle the variability induced by the scoring method from the actual variability in the data, visual and automatic sleep scorings of healthy individuals were examined. Methods: A first dataset (DS1, 4 recordings) scored by 6 experts plus an autoscoring algorithm was used to characterize inter-scoring variability. A second dataset (DS2, 88 recordings) scored a few weeks later was used to investigate intra-expert variability. Percentage agreements and Conger's kappa were derived from epoch-by-epoch comparisons on pairwise, consensus and majority scorings. Results: On DS1 the number of epochs of agreement decreased when the number of expert increased, in both majority and consensus scoring, where agreement ranged from 86% (pairwise) to 69% (all experts). Adding autoscoring to visual scorings changed the kappa value from 0.81 to 0.79. Agreement between expert consensus and autoscoring was 93%. On DS2 intra-expert variability was evidenced by the kappa systematic decrease between autoscoring and each single expert between datasets (0.75 to 0.70). Conclusions: Visual scoring induces inter- and intra-expert variability, which is difficult to address especially in big data studies. When proven to be reliable and if perfectly reproducible, autoscoring methods can cope with intra-scorer variability making them a sensible option when dealing with large datasets.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The microbiota regulates inflammatory responses to toxin-induced CNS demyelination but has minimal impact on remyelination</title>

	<description>The microbiota is now recognised as a key influence on the host immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). As such, there has been some progress towards therapies that modulate the microbiota with the aim of limiting immune-mediated demyelination, as occurs in multiple sclerosis. However, remyelination, the regeneration of myelin sheaths, also depends upon an immune response, and the effects that such interventions might have on remyelination have not yet been explored. Here, we show that the inflammatory response during CNS remyelination in mice is modulated by antibiotic or probiotic treatment, as well as in germ-free mice. We also explore the effect of these changes on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation, which is inhibited by antibiotics but unaffected by our other interventions. These results reveal that high combined doses of oral antibiotics negatively influence remyelination and further our understanding of how mammalian regeneration relates to the microbiota.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Acetylcholine release inhibits distinct excitatory inputs onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons via different cellular and network mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/575811v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In hippocampal CA1, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) activation via exogenous application of cholinergic agonists has been shown to presynaptically inhibit Schaffer collateral (SC) glutamatergic inputs in stratum radiatum (SR), and temporoammonic (TA) and thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) glutamatergic inputs in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). However, steady-state uniform mAChR activation may not mimic the effect of ACh release in an intact hippocampal network. To more accurately examine the effect of ACh release on glutamatergic synaptic efficacy, we measured electrically evoked synaptic responses in CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) following the optogenetic release of ACh in genetically modified mouse brain slices. The ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse SR stimulation (stimulus 2/stimulus 1) was significantly reduced by the optogenetic release of ACh, consistent with a postsynaptic decrease in synaptic efficacy. The effect of ACh release was blocked by the M3 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP, the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 52432, inclusion of GDP-{beta}-S, cesium, QX314 in the intracellular patch clamp solution, or extracellular barium. These observations suggest that ACh release decreased SC synaptic transmission through an M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in inhibitory interneuron excitability, which activate GABAB receptors and inwardly rectifying potassium channels on CA1 pyramidal cells. In contrast, the ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse stimulation in the SLM was increased by ACh release, consistent with presynaptic inhibition. ACh-mediated effects in SLM were blocked by the M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116, presumably located on presynaptic terminals. Therefore, our data indicate that ACh release differentially modulates excitatory inputs in SR and SLM of CA1 through different cellular and network mechanisms.</description>

	<description>The neural representation and perceptual salience of tonal signals presented in different noise maskers were investigated. The properties of the maskers and signals were varied such that they produced different amounts of either monaural masking release, binaural masking release, or a combination of both. The signals were then presented at different levels above their corresponding masked thresholds and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were measured. It was found that, independent of the masking condition, the amplitude of the P2 component of the AEP was similar for the same stimulus levels above masked threshold, suggesting that both monaural and binaural effects of masking release were represented at the level of P2 generation. The perceptual salience of the signal was evaluated at equal levels above masked threshold using a rating task. In contrast to the electrophysiological findings, the subjective ratings of the perceptual signal salience were less consistent with the signal level above masked threshold and varied strongly across listeners and masking conditions. Overall, the results from the present study suggest that the P2 amplitude of the AEP represents an objective indicator of the audibility of a target signal in the presence of complex acoustic maskers.</description>

	<description>A great deal is known about the broad coding and neural ensemble dynamics characterizing forebrain taste processing in awake rats, and about the relationship between these firing rate dynamics and behavior. With regard to mice, in contrast, data concerning cortical taste coding are few, inconclusive, and largely restricted to imaging, which lacks the temporal sensitivity necessary for evaluation of fast response dynamics. Here we have recorded the spiking activity of ensembles of gustatory cortical (GC) single neurons while presenting representatives of the basic taste modalities (sweet, salty, sour and bitter) to awake mice. Our results reveal deep similarities between rat and mouse taste processing. Many recorded murine GC neurons (~66%) responded distinctly to different tastes, and entropy analysis (which measures the breadth of taste coding) further confirmed that the majority of taste neurons in fact responded to 3 or 4 tastes. Temporal coding analyses revealed that single mouse GC neurons sequentially coded taste identity and palatability-the latter responses emerging ~0.5s after the former-a dynamic that population analysis suggested reflects a reliable sequence of network states activated by taste delivery (i.e., ensembles of simultaneously-recorded neurons transitioned suddenly and coherently from coding taste identity to coding taste palatability). All of the above results held across the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of GC-neither between- nor within-mouse mapping revealed regions of narrow or temporally simple taste responses. In conclusion, our data indicates that mouse GC, like rat GC, codes multiple aspects of taste in a coarse, time-varying manner.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hierarchical temporal prediction captures motion processing from retina to higher visual cortex</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/575464v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Visual neurons respond selectively to features that become increasingly complex in their form and dynamics from the eyes to the cortex. These features take specific forms: retinal neurons prefer localized flashing dots, primary visual cortical (V1) neurons moving bars, and those in higher cortical areas, such as middle temporal (MT) cortex, favor complex features like moving textures. Whether there are general principles behind this diverse complexity of response properties in the visual system has been an area of intense investigation. To date, no single normative model has been able to account for the hierarchy of tuning to dynamic inputs along the visual pathway. Here we show that hierarchical temporal prediction - representing features that efficiently predict future sensory input from past sensory input - can explain how neuronal tuning properties, particularly those relating to motion, change from retina to higher visual cortex. In contrast to some other approaches, the temporal prediction framework learns to represent features of unlabeled and dynamic stimuli, an essential requirement of the real brain. This suggests that the brain may not have evolved to efficiently represent all incoming stimuli, as implied by some leading theories. Instead, the selective representation of sensory features that help in predicting the future may be a general coding principle for extracting temporally-structured features that depend on increasingly high-level statistics of the visual input.</description>

Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2HjERBCZGPc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Evaluating the future consequences of actions is achievable by simulating a mental search tree into the future. Expanding deep trees, however, is computationally taxing. Therefore, machines and humans use a plan-until-habit scheme that simulates the environment up to a limited depth and then exploits habitual values as proxies for consequences that may arise in the future. Two outstanding questions in this scheme are “in which directions the search tree should be expanded?”, and “when should the expansion stop?”. Here we propose a principled solution to these questions based on a speed/accuracy tradeoff: deeper expansion in the appropriate directions leads to more accurate planning, but at the cost of slower decision-making. Our simulation results show how this algorithm expands the search tree effectively and efficiently in a grid-world environment. We further show that our algorithm can explain several behavioral patterns in animals and humans, namely the effect of time-pressure on the depth of planning, the effect of reward magnitudes on the direction of planning, and the gradual shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior over the course of training. The algorithm also provides several predictions testable in animal/human experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CETQ5A5g_oA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of targeted medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yPKm5tnZcuc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Different Inhibitory Interneuron Cell Classes Make Distinct Contributions to Visual Contrast Perception</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons [parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)] in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with aromatic &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eight patients (1.67 to 8.42 years of age) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI prior to gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017, median difference = −0.0136, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]) and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. The increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in the patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (R = 0.846; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (R = −0.754; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether CT perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B=‐0.20,p&amp;lt;0.001), independently from blood pressure, ICH volume and other confounders. This association was not dose‐dependent and only very low CBV (&amp;lt;1.4 mL/100g) was significantly associated with HG (B=0.25,p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continual Learning via Neural Pruning. (arXiv:1903.04476v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04476</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04476</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Continual Learning via Neural Pruning (CLNP), a new method aimed
at lifelong learning in fixed capacity models based on neuronal model
sparsification. In this method, subsequent tasks are trained using the inactive
neurons and filters of the sparsified network and cause zero deterioration to
the performance of previous tasks. In order to deal with the possible
compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate
the concept of graceful forgetting: the idea that it is preferable to suffer a
small amount of forgetting in a controlled manner if it helps regain network
capacity and prevents uncontrolled loss of performance during the training of
future tasks. CLNP also provides simple continual learning diagnostic tools in
terms of the number of free neurons left for the training of future tasks as
well as the number of neurons that are being reused. In particular, we see in
experiments that CLNP verifies and automatically takes advantage of the fact
that the features of earlier layers are more transferable. We show empirically
that CLNP leads to significantly improved results over current weight
elasticity based methods.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Labeler-hot Detection of EEG Epileptic Transients. (arXiv:1903.04337v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04337</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04337</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans easily overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A causal role of sensory cortices in behavioral benefits of 'learning by doing'. (arXiv:1903.04201v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04201</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04201</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a rise in the use of &quot;learning by doing&quot; pedagogical methods in
praxis, little is known as to why these methods may improve learning outcomes.
This is surprising given that an increased mechanistic knowledge of learning by
doing-based improvements has the potential to speed up the development of
evidence-based teaching practices. Here we use neuroscience methods and a
gesture-enriched foreign language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm to
adjudicate between opposing predictions of two neuroscientific learning
theories. We demonstrate that sensory brain regions associated with the
processing of gesture-related stimulus information causally contribute to
performance benefits following gesture-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Sensory
brain responses benefitted both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well
as the learning of both concrete and abstract words. These findings suggest
that responses within specialized visual sensory cortices precipitate
sensorimotor-based learning benefits. Such a mechanism could play a role in
comparatively effortless native language learning and may be key for
accelerating L2 proficiency in adults.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the behavior coordinate system, ideal individual model and quantum
probability, the state of an ideal individual is assumed to be described by the
behavior state function. Then we present a conjecture that the ideal
individuals can be identical. A consequence of the identical individual
conjecture is that the existence of the personal space and the behavior
differentiation under high population density condition receive a possible
theoretical explanation.

	<description>Mammalian two-pore channels (TPCs) regulate the physiological functions of the endolysosome. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human TPC2 (HsTPC2), a phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-activated, Na&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;selective channel, in the ligand-bound and apo states. The apo structure captures the closed conformation, while the ligand-bound form features the channel in both open and closed conformations. Combined with functional analysis, these structures provide insights into the mechanism of PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated gating of TPC2, which is distinct from that of TPC1. Specifically, the endolysosome-specific PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;binds at the first 6-TM and activates the channel - independently of the membrane potential - by inducing a structural change at the pore-lining inner helix (IS6), which forms a continuous helix in the open state but breaks into two segments at Gly317 in the closed state. Additionally, structural comparison to the voltage-dependent TPC1 structure allowed us to identify Ile551 as being responsible for the loss of voltage dependence in TPC2.</description>

	<description>Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a heterodecameric protein complex critical for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and nucleotide excision DNA repair. The TFIIH core complex is sufficient for its repair functions and harbors the XPB and XPD DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits, which are affected by human disease mutations. Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.</description>

	<description>Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and deadly kidney cancer in patients of African descent with sickle cell trait. We have developed faithful patient-derived RMC models and using whole-genome sequencing, we identified loss-of-function intronic fusion events in one &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; allele with concurrent loss of the other allele. Biochemical and functional characterization of these models revealed that RMC requires the loss of &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; for survival. Through integration of RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function genetic screens and a small-molecule screen, we found that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was essential in RMC. Inhibition of the UPS caused a G2/M arrest due to constitutive accumulation of cyclin B1. These observations extend across cancers that harbor &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; loss, which also require expression of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, &lt;i&gt;UBE2C&lt;/i&gt;. Our studies identify a synthetic lethal relationship between &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient cancers and reliance on the UPS which provides the foundation for a mechanism-informed clinical trial with proteasome inhibitors.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Generalization of learned responses in the mormyrid electrosensory lobe</title>

	<description>Appropriate generalization of learned responses to new situations is vital for adaptive behavior. We provide a circuit-level account of generalization in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric mormyrid fish. Much is already known in this system about a form of learning in which motor corollary discharge signals cancel responses to the uninformative input evoked by the fish's own electric pulses. However, for this cancellation to be useful under natural circumstances, it must generalize accurately across behavioral regimes, specifically different electric pulse rates. We show that such generalization indeed occurs in ELL neurons, and develop a circuit-level model explaining how this may be achieved. The mechanism involves regularized synaptic plasticity and an approximate matching of the temporal dynamics of motor corollary discharge and electrosensory inputs. Recordings of motor corollary discharge signals in mossy fibers and granule cells provide direct evidence for such matching.</description>

	<description>Metabolism is a highly integrated process resulting in energy and biomass production. While individual metabolic routes are well characterized, the mechanisms ensuring crosstalk between pathways are poorly described though they are crucial for homeostasis. Here, we establish a co-regulation of purine and pyridine metabolism in response to external adenine through two separable mechanisms. First, adenine depletion promotes transcriptional up-regulation of the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; biosynthesis genes by a mechanism requiring the key-purine intermediates ZMP/SZMP and the Bas1/Pho2 transcription factors. Second, adenine supplementation favors the pyridine salvage route resulting in an ATP-dependent increase of intracellular NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This control operates at the level of the nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase Nma1 and can be bypassed by overexpressing this enzyme. Therefore, in yeast, pyridine metabolism is under the dual control of ZMP/SZMP and ATP, revealing a much wider regulatory role for these intermediate metabolites in an integrated biosynthesis network.</description>

	<description>A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the viral replication cycle is an individual cell. Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated separately. In this situation the viral genome is not recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral system is functional through complementation across cells. Our observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.</description>

	<description>As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/&quot;&gt;Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt;, we published a Registered Report (Li et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘The microRNA miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by directly repressing CD44’ (Liu et al., 2011). Here we report the results. We found the microRNA, miR-34a, was expressed at twice the level in CD44&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft tumors (LAPC4 cells) compared to CD44&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; LAPC4 cells, whereas the original study reported miR-34a was underexpressed in CD44&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LAPC4 cells (Figure 1B; Liu et al., 2011). When LAPC4 cells engineered to express miR-34a were injected into mice, we did not observe changes in tumor growth or CD44 expression; however, unexpectedly miR-34a expression was lost &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the original study, LAPC4 cells expressing miR-34a had a statistically significant reduction in tumor regeneration and reduced CD44 expression compared to control (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figures 4A,B and 5C; Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, when we tested if miR-34a regulated CD44 through binding sites in the 3’UTR we did not find a statistically significant difference, whereas the original study reported miR-34a decreased CD44 expression that was partially abrogated by mutation of the binding sites in the &lt;i&gt;CD44&lt;/i&gt; 3’UTR (Figure 4D; Liu et al., 2011). Finally, where possible, we report meta-analyses for each result.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Single cell RNA-seq identifies the origins of heterogeneity in efficient cell transdifferentiation and reprogramming</title>

	<description>Forced transcription factor expression can transdifferentiate somatic cells into other specialized cell types or reprogram them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with variable efficiency. To better understand the heterogeneity of these processes, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to follow the transdifferentation of murine pre-B cells into macrophages as well as their reprogramming into iPSCs. Even in these highly efficient systems, there was substantial variation in the speed and path of fate conversion. We predicted and validated that these differences are inversely coupled and arise in the starting cell population, with Myc&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; large pre-BII cells transdifferentiating slowly but reprogramming efficiently and Myc&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; small pre-BII cells transdifferentiating rapidly but failing to reprogram. Strikingly, differences in Myc activity predict the efficiency of reprogramming across a wide range of somatic cell types. These results illustrate how single cell expression and computational analyses can identify the origins of heterogeneity in cell fate conversion processes.</description>

	<description>Viruses manipulate host cells to enhance their replication, and the identification of cellular factors targeted by viruses has led to key insights into both viral pathogenesis and cell biology. In this study, we develop an HIV reporter virus (HIV-AFMACS) displaying a streptavidin-binding affinity tag at the surface of infected cells, allowing facile one-step selection with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. We use this system to obtain pure populations of HIV-infected primary human CD4+ T cells for detailed proteomic analysis, and quantitate approximately 9000 proteins across multiple donors on a dynamic background of T cell activation. Amongst 650 HIV-dependent changes (q &amp;lt; 0.05), we describe novel Vif-dependent targets FMR1 and DPH7, and 192 proteins not identified and/or regulated in T cell lines, such as ARID5A and PTPN22. We therefore provide a high-coverage functional proteomic atlas of HIV infection, and a mechanistic account of host factors subverted by the virus in its natural target cell.</description>

	<description>Statistical analysis of evolutionary-related protein sequences provides insights about their structure, function, and history. We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), designed to learn complex high-dimensional data and their statistical features, can efficiently model protein families from sequence information. We here apply RBM to twenty protein families, and present detailed results for two short protein domains, Kunitz and WW, one long chaperone protein, Hsp70, and synthetic lattice proteins for benchmarking. The features inferred by the RBM are biologically interpretable: they are related to structure (such as residue-residue tertiary contacts, extended secondary motifs (α-helix and β-sheet) and intrinsically disordered regions), to function (such as activity and ligand specificity), or to phylogenetic identity. In addition, we use RBM to design new protein sequences with putative properties by composing and turning up or down the different modes at will. Our work therefore shows that RBM are a versatile and practical tool to unveil and exploit the genotype-phenotype relationship for protein families.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual recognition of the female body axis drives spatial elements of male courtship in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576322v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Like other mating behaviors, the courtship ritual exhibited by male Drosophila towards a virgin female is comprised of spatiotemporal sequences of innate behavioral elements. Yet, the specific stimuli and neural circuits that determine when and where males release individual courtship elements are not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of visual object recognition in the release of specific behavioral elements during bouts of male courtship. By using a computer vision and machine learning based approach for high-resolution analyses of the male courtship ritual, we show that the release of distinct behavioral elements occur at stereotyped locations around the female and depends on the ability of males to recognize visual landmarks present on the female. Specifically, we show that independent of female motion, males utilize unique populations of visual projection neurons to recognize the eyes of a target female, which is essential for the release of courtship behaviors at their appropriate spatial locations. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for how relatively simple visual cues could play a role in driving both spatially- and temporally-complex social interactions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Activity-dependent changes in synaptic protein complex composition are consistent in different detergents despite differential solubility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576074v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576074v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>At the post-synaptic density (PSD), large protein complexes dynamically form and dissociate in response to synaptic activity, comprising the biophysical basis for learning and memory. The use of detergents to both isolate the PSD fraction and release its membrane-associated proteins complicates studies of these activity-dependent protein interaction networks, because detergents can simultaneously disrupt the very interactions under study. Despite widespread recognition that different detergents yield different experimental results, the effect of detergent on activity-dependent synaptic protein complexes has not been rigorously examined. Here, we characterize the effect of three detergents commonly used to study synaptic proteins on activity-dependent protein interactions. We first demonstrate that SynGAP-containing interactions are more abundant in 1% Deoxycholate (DOC), while Shank-, Homer- and mGluR5-containing interactions are more abundant in 1% NP-40 or Triton. All interactions were detected preferentially in high molecular weight (HMW) complexes generated by size exclusion chromatography, although the detergent-specific abundance of proteins in HMW fractions did not correlate with the abundance of detected interactions. Activity-dependent changes in protein complexes were consistent across detergent types, suggesting that detergents do not isolate distinct protein pools with unique behaviors. However, detection of activity-dependent changes is more or less feasible in different detergents due to baseline solubility. Collectively, our results demonstrate that detergents affect the solubility of individual proteins, but activity-dependent changes in protein interactions, when detectable, are consistent across detergent types.</description>

	<description>Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a promising neuromodulation technique, but its mechanisms remain unclear. We investigate the effect of tFUS stimulation on different neuron types and synaptic connectivity in in vivo anesthetized rodent brains. Single units were separated into regular-spiking and fast-spiking units based on their extracellular spike shapes, further validated in transgenic optogenetic mice models of light-excitable excitatory and inhibitory neurons. For the first time, we show that excitatory neurons are significantly less responsive to low ultrasound pulse repetition frequencies (UPRFs), whereas the spike rates of inhibitory neurons do not change significantly across all UPRF levels. Our results suggest that we can preferentially target specific neuron types noninvasively by altering the tFUS UPRF. We also report in vivo observation of long-term synaptic connectivity changes induced by noninvasive tFUS in rats. This finding suggests tFUS can be used to encode temporally dependent stimulation paradigms into neural circuits and non-invasively elicit long-term changes in synaptic connectivity.</description>

	<description>Diffusion MRI tractography has been used to map the axonal structure of human brain, but its ability to detect neurodegeneration is yet to be explored. Here we report differential tractography, a new type of tractography that utilizes a novel tracking strategy to map the exact segment of fiber pathways with neurodegeneration. It utilizes voxel-wise differences from repeat scans and aggregates them as track-based biomarkers for neurodegeneration. We examined differential tractography on multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and epileptic patients. The results showed that the affected pathways shown by differential tractography matched well with the unique clinical symptoms of the patients, and the false discovery rate of the findings could be estimated using a sham setting to provide a reliability measurement. This novel approach enables a quantitative and objective method to monitor neurodegeneration in individuals, allowing for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of brain diseases.</description>

	<description>Studies have pointed to the role of the brain in mediating the effects of the social environment of the developing child on life outcomes. Since brain development involves nonlinear trajectories, these effects of the child's social context will likely have age-related differential associations with the brain. However, there is still a dearth of integrative research investigating the interplay between neurodevelopmental trajectories, social milieu and life outcomes. We set out to fill this gap, focusing specifically on the role of socioeconomic status, SES (indexed by parental occupation) on brain and cognitive development by analyzing MRI scans from 757 typically-developing subjects (age = 3-21 years). We observed nonlinear interaction of age and SES on cortical thickness, specifically a significant positive association between SES and thickness around 9-13 years at several cortical regions. Using a moderated mediation model, we observed that cortical thickness mediated the link between SES and language abilities, and this mediation was moderated by age in a quadratic pattern, indicating a pronounced SES-effect during early adolescence. Our results, drawn from cross-sectional data, provide a basis for further longitudinal studies to test whether early adolescence may be a sensitive time window for the impact of SES on brain and cognitive development.</description>

	<description>Perturbation of the developmental refinement of the corticospinal pathway leads to motor disorders. In non-primates developmental refinement is well documented, however in primates invasive investigations of the developing corticospinal pathway have been confined to neonatal and postnatal stages when refinement is relatively modest. Here, we investigated the developmental changes in the distribution of corticospinal projection neurons in cynomolgus monkey. Injections of retrograde tracer at the cervical levels of the spinal cord at embryonic day (E) 95 and E105 show that (i) areal distribution of back-labeled neurons is more extensive than in the neonate and dense labeling is found in prefrontal, limbic, temporal and occipital cortex; (ii) distributions of contra- and ipsilateral projecting corticospinal neurons are comparable in terms of location and numbers of labeled neurons, in contrast to the adult where the contralateral projection is an order of magnitude higher than the ipsilateral projection. Findings from one largely restricted injection suggest a hitherto unsuspected early innervation of the gray matter. In the fetus there was in addition dense labeling in the central nucleus of the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the subthalamic nucleus and the adjacent region of the zona incerta, subcortical structures with only minor projections in the adult control.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A multi-state model of the CaMKII dodecamer suggests a role for calmodulin in maintenance of autophosphorylation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/575712v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/575712v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) accounts for up to 2 percent of all brain protein and is essential to memory function. CaMKII activity is known to regulate dynamic shifts in the size and signaling strength of neuronal connections, a process known as synaptic plasticity. Increasingly, computational models are used to explore synaptic plasticity and the mechanisms regulating CaMKII activity. Conventional modeling approaches may exclude biophysical detail due to the impractical number of state combinations that arise when explicitly monitoring the conformational changes, ligand binding, and phosphorylation events that occur on each of the CaMKII holoenzyme's twelve subunits. To manage the combinatorial explosion without necessitating bias or loss in biological accuracy, we use a specialized syntax in the software MCell to create a rule-based model of the twelve-subunit CaMKII holoenzyme. Here we validate the rule-based model against previous measures of CaMKII activity and investigate molecular mechanisms of CaMKII regulation. Specifically, we explore how Ca2+/CaM-binding may both stabilize CaMKII subunit activation and regulate maintenance of CaMKII autophosphorylation. Noting that Ca2+/CaM and protein phosphatases bind CaMKII at nearby or overlapping sites, we compare model scenarios in which Ca2+/CaM and protein phosphatase do or do not structurally exclude each other's binding to CaMKII. Our results suggest a functional mechanism for the so-called &quot;CaM trapping&quot; phenomenon, such that Ca2+/CaM structurally excludes phosphatase binding and thereby prolongs CaMKII autophosphorylation. We conclude that structural protection of autophosphorylated CaMKII by Ca2+/CaM may be an important mechanism for regulation of synaptic plasticity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of persistent sodium current blockade in respiratory circuits depend on the pharmacological mechanism of action and network dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/575688v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/575688v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The mechanism(s) of action of most commonly used pharmacological blockers of voltage-gated ion channels are well understood; however, this knowledge is rarely considered when interpreting experimental data. Effects of blockade are often assumed to be equivalent, regardless of the mechanism of the blocker involved. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this assumption may not always be correct. We simulate the blockade of a persistent sodium current (INaP), proposed to underlie rhythm generation in pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) respiratory neurons, via two distinct pharmacological mechanisms: (1) pore obstruction mediated by tetrodotoxin and (2) altered inactivation dynamics mediated by riluzole. The reported effects of experimental application of tetrodotoxin and riluzole in respiratory circuits are diverse and seemingly contradictory and have led to considerable debate within the field as to the specific role of INaP in respiratory circuits. The results of our simulations match a wide array of experimental data spanning from the level of isolated pre-BotC neurons to the level of the intact respiratory network and also generate a series of experimentally testable predictions. Specifically, in this study we: (1) provide a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block, (2) show that the effects of INaP block in in vitro preparations are not necessarily equivalent to those in more intact preparations, (3) demonstrate and explain why riluzole application may fail to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network, and (4) derive the prediction that effective block of INaP by low concentration tetrodotoxin will stop respiratory rhythm generation in the intact respiratory network. These simulations support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and illustrate the importance of considering mechanism when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.</description>

	<description>Nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors TrkA and p75 play a key role in the development and function of peripheral nociceptive neurons. Here we describe novel technology to selectively photoablate TrkA positive nociceptors through delivery of a phototoxic agent coupled to an engineered NGF ligand and subsequent near infrared (NIR) illumination. We demonstrate that this approach allows for on demand and localized reversal of pain behaviors in mouse models of acute, inflammatory, neuropathic and joint pain. To target peripheral nociceptors we generated a SNAP-tagged NGF derivative, NGFR121W that binds to TrkA/p75 receptors but does not provoke signaling in TrkA positive cells or elicit pain behaviors in mice. NGFR121W-SNAP was coupled to the photosensitizer IRDye 700DX phthalocyanine (IR700) and injected subcutaneously. Following NIR illumination of the injected area, behavioral responses to nociceptive mechanical and sustained thermal stimuli, but not innocuous stimuli, were substantially reduced. Similarly, in models of inflammatory, osteoarthritic and neuropathic pain, mechanical hypersensitivity was abolished for three weeks following a single treatment regime. We demonstrate that this loss of pain behavior coincides with the retraction of neurons from the skin which then re-innervate the epidermis after 3 weeks corresponding with the return of mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus NGFR121W-SNAP-mediated photoablation is a minimally invasive approach to reversibly silence nociceptor input from the periphery, and control pain and hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli.</description>

	<description>Essential tremor is the most prevalent movement disorder and is often refractory to medical treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers a therapeutic approach that can efficiently control tremor symptoms. Several DBS targets (ventral intermediate nucleus, zona incerta, posterior subthalamic area) have been discussed for tremor treatment. Effective DBS therapy for tremor critically involves optimal targeting to modulate the tremor network. This could potentially become more robust and precise by using state-of-the-art brain connectivity measurements. In the current study, we utilized two normative brain connectomes (structural and functional) to show the pattern of effective DBS electrode connectivity in 33 essential tremor patients. Our structural and functional connectivity models were significantly predictive of post-operative tremor improvement in out-of-sample data (structural, R = 0.48, p &amp;lt; 10-4; functional, R &amp;lt; 0.41, p = 0.001; leave-one-out cross-validation). Additionally, we segregated the somatotopic brain network based on head and hand tremor scores. These resulted in segregations that mapped onto the well-known somatotopic maps of both motor cortex and cerebellum. Crucially, this shows that slightly distinct networks need to be modulated to ameliorate head vs. hand tremor and that those networks could be identified based on somatotopic zones in motor cortex and cerebellum. Finally, we propose a multi-modal connectomic DBS sweet spot that may serve as a reference to enhance clinical care, in the future. This spot resided in the posterior subthalamic area, encroaching on the inferior borders of VIM and sensory thalamus. Our results underscore the importance of integrating brain connectivity in optimizing DBS targeting for essential tremor.</description>

	<description>Understanding the origin of the main physiological processes involved in consciousness is a major challenge of contemporary neuroscience, with crucial implications for the study of Disorders of Consciousness (DOC). The difficulties in achieving this task include the considerable quantity of experimental data in this field, along with the non-intuitive, nonlinear nature of neuronal dynamics. One possibility of integrating the main results from the experimental literature into a cohesive framework, while accounting for nonlinear brain dynamics, is the use of physiologically-inspired computational models. In this study, we present a physiologically-grounded computational model, attempting to account for the main micro-circuits identified in the human cortex, while including the specificities of each neuronal type. More specifically, the model accounts for thalamo-cortical (vertical) regulation of cortico-cortical (horizontal) connectivity, which is a central mechanism for brain information integration and processing. The distinct neuronal assemblies communicate through feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections implemented in a template brain accounting for long-range connectome. The EEG generated by this physiologically-based simulated brain is validated through comparison with brain rhythms recorded in humans in two states of consciousness (wakefulness, sleep). Using the model, it is possible to reproduce the local disynaptic disinhibition of basket cells (fast GABAergic inhibition) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons through long-range activation of VIP interneurons that induced inhibition of SST interneurons. The model (COALIA) predicts that the strength and dynamics of the thalamic output on the cortex control the local and long-range cortical processing of information. Furthermore, the model reproduces and explains clinical results regarding the complexity of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked EEG responses in DOC patients and healthy volunteers, through a modulation of thalamo-cortical connectivity that governs the level of cortico-cortical communication. This new model provides a quantitative framework to accelerate the study of the physiological mechanisms involved in the emergence, maintenance and disruption (sleep, anesthesia, DOC) of consciousness.</description>

Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a “penalty shot” task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys’ strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players’ goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players’ strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EQny46_S5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DEY-lhs5fHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment “input” to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This “myopic” controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control’s utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control’s utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6oinXWRforY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DT3PsYmnYd0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Centrosome amplification (CA) is a common feature of human tumours and a promising target for cancer therapy. However, CA’s pan-cancer prevalence, molecular role in tumourigenesis and therapeutic value in the clinical setting are still largely unexplored. Here, we used a transcriptomic signature (CA20) to characterise the landscape of CA-associated gene expression in 9,721 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CA20 is upregulated in cancer and associated with distinct clinical and molecular features of breast cancer, consistently with our experimental CA quantification in patient samples. Moreover, we show that CA20 upregulation is positively associated with genomic instability, alteration of specific chromosomal arms and C&amp;gt;T mutations, and we propose novel molecular players associated with CA in cancer. Finally, high CA20 is associated with poor prognosis and, by integrating drug sensitivity with drug perturbation profiles in cell lines, we identify candidate compounds for selectively targeting cancer cells exhibiting transcriptomic evidence for CA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-C_Yq4jH6sA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A fundamental assumption, common to the vast majority of high-throughput transcriptome analyses, is that the expression of most genes is unchanged among samples and that total cellular RNA remains constant. As the number of analyzed experimental systems increases however, different independent studies demonstrate that this assumption is often violated. We present a calibration method using RNA spike-ins that allows for the measurement of absolute cellular abundance of RNA molecules. We apply the method to pooled RNA from cell populations of known sizes. For each transcript, we compute a nominal abundance that can be converted to absolute by dividing by a scale factor determined in separate experiments: the yield coefficient of the transcript relative to that of a reference spike-in measured with the same protocol. The method is derived by maximum likelihood theory in the context is a complete statistical model for sequencing counts contributed by cellular RNA and spike-ins. The counts are based on a sample from a fixed number of cells to which a fixed population of spike-in molecules has been added. We illustrate and evaluate the method with applications to two global expression data sets, one from the model eukaryote &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, proliferating at different growth rates, and differentiating cardiopharyngeal cell lineages in the chordate &lt;i&gt;Ciona robusta&lt;/i&gt;. We tested the method in a technical replicate dilution study, and in a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-fold validation study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQHAuYv6IDY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), we applied 3 different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. Four of 31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7 of 30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus, PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson disease. The morphologically diverse deposition of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in genetic and sporadic CJD argues against uniform mechanisms of propagation of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large, population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, previous concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. Ninety‐five percent of twins are now deceased. Here, we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Proband‐wise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed ≤50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &amp;gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Homocysteine and small vessel stroke: A mendelian randomization analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1), and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.58; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52–0.94; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The meta-problem and the transfer of knowledge between theories of consciousness: a software engineer's take. (arXiv:1903.03418v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This contribution examines two radically different explanations of our
phenomenal intuitions, one reductive and one strongly non-reductive, and
identifies two germane ideas that could benefit many other theories of
consciousness. Firstly, the ability of sophisticated agent architectures with a
purely physical implementation to support certain functional forms of qualia or
proto-qualia appears to entail the possibility of machine consciousness with
qualia, not only for reductive theories but also for the nonreductive ones that
regard consciousness as ubiquitous in Nature. Secondly, analysis of
introspective psychological material seems to hint that, under the threshold of
our ordinary waking awareness, there exist further 'submerged' or 'subliminal'
layers of consciousness which constitute a hidden foundation and support and
another source of our phenomenal intuitions. These 'submerged' layers might
help explain certain puzzling phenomena concerning subliminal perception, such
as the apparently 'unconscious' multisensory integration and learning of
subliminal stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automatic epileptic seizure analysis is important because the differentiation
of neural patterns among different patients can be used to classify people with
specific types of epilepsy. This could enable more efficient management of the
disease. Automatic seizure type classification using clinical
electroencephalograms (EEGs) is challenging due to factors such as low signal
to noise ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in the seizure semiology among
individual epileptic patients, and limited clinical data constraints. To
overcome these challenges, in this paper, we present a deep learning based
framework which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dense
connections and learns highly robust features at different spatial and temporal
resolutions of the EEG data spectrum for accurate cross-patient seizure type
classification. We evaluate our framework for seizure type classification and
seizure detection on the recently released TUH EEG Seizure Corpus, where our
framework achieves overall weighted f 1 scores of up to 0.90 and 0.88, thereby
setting new benchmarks on the dataset.

	<description>Rhythmical brain activity around 5Hz can be observed in the prefrontal cortex under conditions requiring high levels of cognitive control. However, its temporal dynamics are still elusive. A recent research paper (Cooper et al. Neuroimage 2019;189:130–140) provides evidence that the temporal evolution of this frontal-midline theta activity reflects the style of cognitive control being implemented.</description>

	<description>At excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking neuroligins, Nlgn1 rescues impairments in functional and structural LTP and in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Structure-function rescue experiments reveal that Nlgn1 plays mechanistically distinct roles in LTP and basal NMDA receptor-mediated transmission.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Deep cerebellar stimulation reduces ataxic motor symptoms in the shaker rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25464?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25464?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls. Loss of Purkinje cells, nearly universal across DCAs, dysregulates the dentatothalamocortical network. To address the paucity of treatment strategies, we developed an electrical stimulation‐based therapy for DCAs targeting the dorsal dentate nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this therapeutic strategy in the Wistar Furth &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rat model of Purkinje cell loss resulting in tremor and ataxia. We implanted &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rats with stimulating electrodes targeted to the dorsal dentate nucleus and tested a spectrum of frequencies ranging from 4 to 180 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulation at 30 Hz most effectively reduced motor symptoms. Stimulation frequencies over 100 Hz, commonly used for Parkinsonism and essential tremor, worsened incoordination, while frequencies within the tremor physiologic range may worsen tremor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low‐frequency deep cerebellar stimulation may provide a novel strategy for treating motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.&lt;/p&gt;

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation. Here, we summarize key recent findings that have shaped our knowledge of the precise location of local protein production and discuss unique strategies used by neurons to shape presynaptic and postsynaptic proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Michal Lipinski, Beatriz del Blanco, Angel Barco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paralogous transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300 (&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; KAT3A and KAT3B, respectively) contain a characteristic and promiscuous lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain and multiple independent protein-binding domains that enable them to interact with hundreds of proteins, possibly promoting the acetylation of thousands of target lysine residues. Both proteins play critical roles during the development of the nervous system and may also regulate stimuli-driven transcription and plasticity in postmitotic neurons. The multiplicity of functions, substrates, and molecular partners, together with the redundancy and singularity of the two KAT3 paralogs, define a complex cat’s cradle of relationships. In this review, we discuss the role of the KAT3 proteins in neurons and integrate recent information regarding their function and mode of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multiplicity of functions, substrates, and molecular partners of the two KAT3 proteins defines a complex cat’s cradle of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818302101-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology, and identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP=13, FTLD‐Tau=14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to eight cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Postmortem&lt;/i&gt; cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta=‐0.15,SE=0.05,p=0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta=‐0.09,SE=0.04,p=0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta=‐8.18,SE=3.22,p=0.015). Among five core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (F=47.07,df=1,17,p&amp;lt;0.001), and in left mid‐frontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (F=19.34,df=1,16,p&amp;lt;0.001). &lt;i&gt;Postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology was inversely associated with &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; MRI cortical thickness (beta=‐0.04,SE=0.01,p=0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t=‐3.72,df=10.72,p=0.004), while nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t=‐3.62,df=12.00,p=0.004) among the five core pathology regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology that relate to &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; structural imaging and distinct language deficits. While other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pre‐treatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year of follow‐up. Notably, “no evidence of disease activity” at 2‐years did not predict long‐term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long‐term disability accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0 or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0; 1.0‐5.0; and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (± 1 year) and sustained to year 10 (± 1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and &lt;i&gt;HLA‐DRB1*15:01&lt;/i&gt; as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over one‐year intervals (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the term &lt;i&gt;silent progression&lt;/i&gt; to describe the insidious disability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing remitting MS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Optimal Inter‐Eye Difference Thresholds by OCT in MS: An International Study</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the optimal thresholds for inter‐eye differences in retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thicknesses for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current international diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis do not include the optic nerve as a lesion site despite frequent involvement. Optical coherence tomography detects retinal thinning associated with optic nerve lesions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multi‐center international study at 11 sites, optical coherence tomography was measured for patients and healthy controls as part of the International Multiple Sclerosis Visual System Consortium. High‐ and low‐contrast acuity were also collected in a subset of participants. Presence of an optic nerve lesion for this study was defined as history of acute unilateral optic neuritis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among patients (n=1,530), receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an optimal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer inter‐eye difference threshold of 5 microns and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer threshold of 4 microns for identifying unilateral optic neuritis (n=477). Greater inter‐eye differences in acuities were associated with greater inter‐eye retinal layer thickness differences (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;≤0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inter‐eye differences of 5 microns for retinal nerve fiber layer and 4 microns for macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer are robust thresholds for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions. These thresholds may be useful to establish the presence of asymptomatic and symptomatic optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis and could be useful in a new version of the diagnostic criteria. Our findings lend further validation for utilizing the visual system in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial setting.&lt;/p&gt;

Multi-scale computational modeling is a major branch of computational biology as evidenced by the US federal interagency Multi-Scale Modeling Consortium and major international projects. It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing. During all stages of the workflow design, we rely on freely available open-source tools, to make our workflow freely usable by scientists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iVBpJTia4EY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to produce desired compounds on an industrial scale in a cost effective manner. To address challenges in metabolic engineering, computational strain optimization algorithms based on genome-scale metabolic models have increasingly been used to aid in overproducing products of interest. However, most of these strain optimization algorithms utilize a metabolic network alone, with few approaches providing strategies that also include transcriptional regulation. Moreover previous integrated approaches generally require a pre-existing regulatory network. In this study, we developed a novel strain design algorithm, named OptRAM (Optimization of Regulatory And Metabolic Networks), which can identify combinatorial optimization strategies including overexpression, knockdown or knockout of both metabolic genes and transcription factors. OptRAM is based on our previous IDREAM integrated network framework, which makes it able to deduce a regulatory network from data. OptRAM uses simulated annealing with a novel objective function, which can ensure a favorable coupling between desired chemical and cell growth. The other advance we propose is a systematic evaluation metric of multiple solutions, by considering the essential genes, flux variation, and engineering manipulation cost. We applied OptRAM to generate strain designs for succinate, 2,3-butanediol, and ethanol overproduction in yeast, which predicted high minimum predicted target production rate compared with other methods and previous literature values. Moreover, most of the genes and TFs proposed to be altered by OptRAM in these scenarios have been validated by modification of the exact genes or the target genes regulated by the TFs, for overproduction of these desired compounds by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments cataloged in the LASER database. Particularly, we successfully validated the predicted strain optimization strategy for ethanol production by fermentation experiment. In conclusion, OptRAM can provide a useful approach that leverages an integrated transcriptional regulatory network and metabolic network to guide metabolic engineering applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qYemLAl00uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion, which operates according to local topological features, is informationally “cheap” but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network communication that combines local and global information about the network topology to generate biased random walks on the network. The model generates a continuous spectrum of dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion) communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying the global information bias on the network’s communication cost. We identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path communication process with a relatively small global information bias on the system’s dynamics. Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes varies as a function of the global information bias driving the system’s dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, unifying both models under a single family of dynamical processes that differ by the extent to which global information about the network topology influences the routing patterns of neural signals traversing the network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ow07hxgdlFY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Management of vector population is a commonly used method for mitigating transmission of mosquito-borne infections, but quantitative information on its practical public health impact is scarce. We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015–2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CKNKwFuw4ko&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Human networks of sexual contacts are dynamic by nature, with partnerships forming and breaking continuously over time. Sexual behaviours are also highly heterogeneous, so that the number of partners reported by individuals over a given period of time is typically distributed as a power-law. Both the dynamism and heterogeneity of sexual partnerships are likely to have an effect in the patterns of spread of sexually transmitted diseases. To represent these two fundamental properties of sexual networks, we developed a stochastic process of dynamic partnership formation and dissolution, which results in power-law numbers of partners over time. Model parameters can be set to produce realistic conditions in terms of the exponent of the power-law distribution, of the number of individuals without relationships and of the average duration of relationships. Using an outbreak of antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea amongst men have sex with men as a case study, we show that our realistic dynamic network exhibits different properties compared to the frequently used static networks or homogeneous mixing models. We also consider an approximation to our dynamic network model in terms of a much simpler branching process. We estimate the parameters of the generation time distribution and offspring distribution which can be used for example in the context of outbreak reconstruction based on genomic data. Finally, we investigate the impact of a range of interventions against gonorrhoea, including increased condom use, more frequent screening and immunisation, concluding that the latter shows great promise to reduce the burden of gonorrhoea, even if the vaccine was only partially effective or applied to only a random subset of the population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GeqSrTgTJqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Methods for computing the maximum performance of computational models of fMRI responses</title>

Computational neuroimaging methods aim to predict brain responses (measured e.g. with functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) on the basis of stimulus features obtained through computational models. The accuracy of such prediction is used as an indicator of how well the model describes the computations underlying the brain function that is being considered. However, the prediction accuracy is bounded by the proportion of the variance of the brain response which is related to the measurement noise and not to the stimuli (or cognitive functions). This bound to the performance of a computational model has been referred to as the noise ceiling. In previous fMRI applications two methods have been proposed to estimate the noise ceiling based on either a split-half procedure or Monte Carlo simulations. These methods make different assumptions over the nature of the effects underlying the data, and, importantly, their relation has not been clarified yet. Here, we derive an analytical form for the noise ceiling that does not require computationally expensive simulations or a splitting procedure that reduce the amount of data. The validity of this analytical definition is proved in simulations, we show that the analytical solution results in the same estimate of the noise ceiling as the Monte Carlo method. Considering different simulated noise structure, we evaluate different estimators of the variance of the responses and their impact on the estimation of the noise ceiling. We furthermore evaluate the effect the interplay between regularization (often used to estimate model fits to the data when the number of computational features in the model is large) and model complexity on the performance with respect to the noise ceiling. Our results indicate that when considering the variance of the responses across runs, the computing the noise ceiling analytically results in similar estimates as the split half estimator and approaches the true noise ceiling under a variety of simulated noise scenarios. Finally, the methods are tested on real fMRI data acquired at 7 Tesla.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EvcjzeEKdD4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Model simulations indicate that the response of growing cell populations on mechanical stress follows the same functional relationship and is predictable over different cell lines and growth conditions despite the response curves look largely different. We develop a hybrid model strategy in which cells are represented by coarse-grained individual units calibrated with a high resolution cell model and parameterized measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters. Cell cycle progression in our model is controlled by volumetric strain, the latter being derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After parameter calibration from experiments with mouse colon carcinoma cells growing against the resistance of an elastic alginate capsule, the model adequately predicts the growth curve in i) soft and rigid capsules, ii) in different experimental conditions where the mechanical stress is generated by osmosis via a high molecular weight dextran solution, and iii) for other cell types with different growth kinetics. Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IDBZAvqfb9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How adaptive plasticity evolves when selected against</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006260</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ocIV_rplJgY/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfredo Rago, Kostas Kouvaris, Tobias Uller, Richard Watson&lt;/p&gt;

Adaptive plasticity allows organisms to cope with environmental change, thereby increasing the population’s long-term fitness. However, individual selection can only compare the fitness of individuals within each generation: if the environment changes more slowly than the generation time (i.e., a coarse-grained environment) a population will not experience selection for plasticity even if it is adaptive in the long-term. How does adaptive plasticity then evolve? One explanation is that, if competing alleles conferring different degrees of plasticity persist across multiple environments, natural selection between genetic lineages could select for adaptive plasticity (lineage selection). We show that adaptive plasticity can evolve even in the absence of such lineage selection. Instead, we propose that adaptive plasticity in coarse-grained environments evolves as a by-product of inefficient short-term natural selection: populations that rapidly evolve their phenotypes in response to selective pressures follow short-term optima, with the result that they have reduced long-term fitness across environments. Conversely, populations that accumulate limited genetic change within each environment evolve long-term adaptive plasticity even when plasticity incurs short-term costs. These results remain qualitatively similar regardless of whether we decrease the efficiency of natural selection by increasing the rate of environmental change or decreasing mutation rate, demonstrating that both factors act via the same mechanism. We demonstrate how this mechanism can be understood through the concept of learning rate. Our work shows how plastic responses that are costly in the short term, yet adaptive in the long term, can evolve as a by-product of inefficient short-term selection, without selection for plasticity at either the individual or lineage level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ocIV_rplJgY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt;) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new onset refractory status epilepticus, with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt; gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n = 7) relative to healthy controls (n = 10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in 3 FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt; in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.

Based on the ideal individual model, the behavior coordinate system and the
quantum probability, a toy quantum model of human psychology is presented here
in a different way. It can give some enlightening viewpoints through which some
phenomena can be discussed from a different perspective.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As put forward by neuroscientists, the mechanisms of consciousness can be
elucidated by revealing correlations between neural dynamics and specific
conscious percepts. Recently, I have elaborated on the mathematical formulation
for a system of processes that are mutually connected to be isomorphic to a
conscious percept of a point in space. Importantly, in such a system, any
process can be derived through all other processes that form its complement, or
interpretation. To generate such a solution, I am proposing a dynamical system
of oscillators coupled in a manner to preserve the properties of a percept.
Specifically, I crafted a dynamical system that retains the mutual
relationships among processes, forming an operational map isomorphic to a
distance matrix that mimics a percept of space-like properties. The study and
results pave a novel way to analyze the dynamics of neural-like (oscillatory)
processes with a purpose of extracting the information relevant to specific
conscious percepts, which will facilitate the search for neural correlates of
consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: What the odor is not: Estimation by elimination. (arXiv:1903.02580v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02580</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02580</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system uses the responses of a small number of broadly
sensitive receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we
propose a method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea
is that a receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information
than a receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants.
So a response below threshold signals the absence of all such odorants. As a
result, it is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the
odor is. We demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors,
response functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method
of elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined
one, allowing accurate determination of the odorants in a mixture and their
concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm
which resembles the known circuit architecture of the piriform cortex.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating the number of genetic mutations (hits) required for carcinogenesis based on the distribution of somatic mutations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ramu Anandakrishnan, Robin T. Varghese, Nicholas A. Kinney, Harold R. Garner&lt;/p&gt;

Individual instances of cancer are primarily a result of a combination of a small number of genetic mutations (hits). Knowing the number of such mutations is a prerequisite for identifying specific combinations of carcinogenic mutations and understanding the etiology of cancer. We present a mathematical model for estimating the number of hits based on the distribution of somatic mutations. The model is fundamentally different from previous approaches, which are based on cancer incidence by age. Our somatic mutation based model is likely to be more robust than age-based models since it does not require knowing or accounting for the highly variable mutation rate, which can vary by over three orders of magnitude. In fact, we find that the number of somatic mutations at diagnosis is weakly correlated with age at cancer diagnosis, most likely due to the extreme variability in mutation rates between individuals. Comparing the distribution of somatic mutations predicted by our model to the actual distribution from 6904 tumor samples we estimate the number of hits required for carcinogenesis for 17 cancer types. We find that different cancer types exhibit distinct somatic mutational profiles corresponding to different numbers of hits. Why might different cancer types require different numbers of hits for carcinogenesis? The answer may provide insight into the unique etiology of different cancer types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lXznQOD3I34&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A theoretical single-parameter model for urbanisation to study infectious disease spread and interventions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006879</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Solveig Engebretsen, Kenth Engø-Monsen, Arnoldo Frigessi, Birgitte Freiesleben de Blasio&lt;/p&gt;

The world is continuously urbanising, resulting in clusters of densely populated urban areas and more sparsely populated rural areas. We propose a method for generating spatial fields with controllable levels of clustering of the population. We build a synthetic country, and use this method to generate versions of the country with different clustering levels. Combined with a metapopulation model for infectious disease spread, this allows us to in silico explore how urbanisation affects infectious disease spread. In a baseline scenario with no interventions, the underlying population clustering seems to have little effect on the final size and timing of the epidemic. Under within-country restrictions on non-commuting travel, the final size decreases with increased population clustering. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing the final size is larger with higher clustering. The reduction is larger in the more rural areas. Within-country travel restrictions delay the epidemic, and the delay is largest for lower clustering levels. We implemented three different vaccination strategies—uniform vaccination (in space), preferentially vaccinating urban locations and preferentially vaccinating rural locations. The urban and uniform vaccination strategies were most effective in reducing the final size, while the rural vaccination strategy was clearly inferior. Visual inspection of some European countries shows that many countries already have high population clustering. In the future, they will likely become even more clustered. Hence, according to our model, within-country travel restrictions are likely to be less and less effective in delaying epidemics, while they will be more effective in decreasing final sizes. In addition, to minimise final sizes, it is important not to neglect urban locations when distributing vaccines. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the effect of urbanisation on infectious disease spread and in particular, to examine effectiveness of prevention measures as a function of urbanisation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uODzDXo-hSs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SCN1A gain of function in early infantile encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype–phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than typical &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; Dravet syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive action potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neurons. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a biophysical perspective, the T226M mutation produces gain of function. Somewhat paradoxically, our data suggest that this gain of function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the “central vein sign” in the radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human MRI‐pathological data that inflammation‐dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility‐based MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), vessel‐wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in lesions less than two weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long‐term effect of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially affect tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Selectively inhibiting the median preoptic nucleus attenuates angiotensin II and hyperosmotic-induced drinking behavior and vasopressin release in adult male rats</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After 2 weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats were used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle ip followed by a test treatment with either 2mg/kg ANG II or 3% hypertonic saline (1mL/100g bw) sc, twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The MnPO is an important regulatory center that influences thirst, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function. Activation of different MnPO neuronal populations can inhibit or stimulate water intake. However, the role of the MnPO and its pathway-specific projections during ANG II and hyperosmotic challenges still have not yet been fully elucidated. These studies directly address this by using DREADDs to acutely and selectively inhibit pathway-specific MnPO neurons, and uses techniques that measure changes at the protein, neuronal, and overall physiological and behavioral level. More importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that physiological challenges related to extracellular (ANG II) or cellular (hypertonic saline) dehydration activate MnPO neurons that may project to different parts of the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: FGF-23-deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognitive function</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factor receptor and α-Klotho transduce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) signaling in renal tubules to maintain systemic phosphate/Vitamin D homeostasis. Mice deficient for either the ligand, FGF-23, or the co-receptor, Klotho, are phenocopies with both showing rapid and premature development of multiple aging-like abnormalities. Such similarity in phenotype, suggests that FGF-23 and Klotho have co-dependent systemic functions. Recent reports revealed inverse central nervous system effects of Klotho deficiency or Klotho overexpression on hippocampal synaptic, neurogenic, and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown whether FGF-23 deficiency effects function of the hippocampus. We report that, similar to Klotho-deficient mice, FGF-23-deficient mice develop dose-dependent, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment. However, FGF-23-deficient brains had no gross structural or developmental defects, no change in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and only minor impairment to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Together these data provide evidence that FGF-23 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognition but otherwise results in a brain phenotype that is distinct from the KL-deficient mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although FGF-23 is reportedly expressed by the brain, it has no known brain function. In the periphery, kidney transduction of FGF-23 signaling is required for proper phosphate, calcium and Vitamin D homeostasis. Recent reports show that Klotho, the obligate FGF-23 co-receptor, is required for multiple hippocampal activities. If Klotho-deficient brain effects are the result of disrupted FGF-23 signaling, similar phenotypes may occur under conditions of FGF-23 deficiency. Herein, studies were undertaken to determine whether FGF-23-deficient mice show impairment of the same hippocampal functions, as a first step toward investigating whether FGF-23 is the mechanism by which Klotho effects brain function. Our data show that FGF-23 is only required for normal hippocampal-dependent cognition suggesting that FGF-23 may effect the brain uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Phase Coherent Currents underlying neocortical seizure-like state transitions</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential and whole cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised 2-state hidden Markov model (HMM). Gamma distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-AP induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To date, the underlying excitatory and inhibitory bases of objectively identified seizure sub-states have not been determined. Here we identify these sub-states using phase amplitude cross frequency coupling features. This is tested in both human and rodent seizure models. Then, using simultaneous field and whole cell recordings in a mouse model, we investigate the potential for explaining seizure sub-state dynamics from interactions of the excitatory and inhibitory currents with local field network activity. We found that the frequency ranges at which these currents are coherent with field oscillations have a dramatic effect on the predictability of seizure state sub-states. Such information is critical for identifying the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Development of local circuit connections to hilar mossy cells in the mouse dentate gyrus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice, which expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal days 6-7 (P6-7), mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13-14 and P21-28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6-7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13-14 and P21-28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13-14 and decreased slightly in older P21-28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mossy cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) have been implicated in hippocampal circuits regulating pattern separation, an important function attributed to the DG. However, physiological inputs regulating mossy cell activity are incompletely understood. Here, we show that sources of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs arise developmentally. Our results suggest that excitatory inputs from the DG and local inhibitory inputs are well-positioned to powerfully sculpt receptive fields in mature mossy cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Brain region-specific gene signatures revealed by distinct astrocyte subpopulations unveil links to glioma and neurodegenerative diseases</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no effective treatments for glioma or for neurodegenerative diseases due, in part, to our limited understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular heterogeneity of these diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. In a previous study, five molecularly distinct astrocyte subpopulations from three different brain regions were identified. To further delineate the underlying diversity of these populations, we obtained mouse brain region-specific gene signatures for both protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and found that these astrocyte subpopulations are endowed with unique molecular signatures across diverse brain regions. Additional gene set and single-sample enrichment analyses revealed that gene signatures of different subpopulations are differentially correlated with glioma tumors that harbor distinct genomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that links transcriptional profiles of astrocyte subpopulations with glioma genomic mutations. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that subpopulations of astrocytes in select brain regions are associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the present study provides a new perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of glioma and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the potential contributions of diverse astrocyte populations to normal, malignant, and degenerative brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in disease pathogenesis by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. The present study identifies new layers of astrocyte diversity and new correlations between distinct astrocyte subpopulations and disease states. Understanding the heterogeneity of astrocytes in different physiological conditions and diseases will provide new avenues for improved diagnostics and therapeutics targeting specific astrocyte subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Choice-Related Activity during Visual Slant Discrimination in Macaque CIP but Not V3A</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and which precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted towards or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Surface orientation perception is fundamental to visually guided behaviors such as reaching, grasping, and navigation. Previous studies implicate the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) in the representation of 3D surface orientation. Here we show that responses to 3D oriented planar surfaces are similar in CIP and V3A, which precedes CIP in the cortical hierarchy. However, we also find a qualitative distinction between the two areas: only CIP neurons show robust choice-related activity during a fine visual orientation discrimination task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrophysiological properties of medium spiny neuron subtypes in the caudate-putamen of prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The findings presented here provide the most comprehensive evaluation of the electrophysiological properties of caudate-putamen medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes ever performed in a single study, both in terms of electrophysiological metrics and animal sex. These data selectively confirm, diverge from, and extend the findings of previous studies, providing a firm foundation upon which to pursue future studies of caudate-putamen MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: SpykeTorch: Efficient Simulation of Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks with at most one Spike per Neuron. (arXiv:1903.02440v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02440</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since
SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking
counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not
practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on
PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per
neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are
implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the
aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of
reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed
framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn
brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or
Multi-GPU platforms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The shape and connectivity of a neuron determine its function. Modern imaging
methods have proven successful at extracting such information. However, in
order to analyze this type of data, neuronal morphology needs to be encoded in
a graph-theoretic method. This encoding enables the use of high throughput
informatic methods to extract and infer brain function. The application of
graph-theoretic methods to neuronal morphological representation comes with
certain difficulties. Here we report a novel, effective method to accomplish
this task.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morphology of a neuron, which consists of its overall size, global shape,
local branch patterns, and cell-specific biophysical properties, can vary
significantly with the cell's identity, location, as well as developmental and
physiological state. Various algorithms have been developed to customize shape
based statistical and graph related features for quantitative analysis of
neuromorphology, followed by the classification of neuron cell types using the
features. Unlike the classical feature extraction based methods from imaged or
3D reconstructed neurons, we propose a model based on the rooted path
decomposition from the soma to the dendrites of a neuron and extract
morphological features on each path. We hypothesize that measuring the distance
between two neurons can be realized by minimizing the cost of continuously
morphing the set of all rooted paths of one neuron to another. To validate this
claim, we first establish the correspondence of paths between two neurons using
a modified Munkres algorithm. Next, an elastic deformation framework that
employs the square root velocity function is established to perform the
continuous morphing, which, in addition, provides an effective visualization
tool. We experimentally show the efficacy of NeuroPath2Path, NeuroP2P, over the
state of the art.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Desynchronization dynamics of the Kuramoto model on connectome graphs. (arXiv:1903.00385v2 [cond-mat.dis-nn] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00385</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00385</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The time dependent behavior of the Kuramoto model, describing
synchronization, has been studied numerically on small-world graphs. We
determined the desynchronziation behavior, by solving this model via the 4th
order Runge-Kutta algorithm on a large, weighted human connectome network and
compared the results with those of a two-dimensional lattice, with additional
random, long-range links. In the latter case a mean-field critical transition
is expected and here we provide numerical results for the
synchonization/desynchonization duration distributions. We find power-law
tails, characterized by a critical exponent $\tau_d \simeq 1.6(1)$. In case of
the connectome we assumed a homeostatic state, by the application of normalized
incoming weights. Since this graph has a topological dimension $d &amp;lt; 4$ a real
synchronization phase transition is not possible in the thermodynamic limit,
still we could locate a transition between partially synchronized and
desynchronized states. At this crossover point we observe power-law--tailed
desynchronization durations, with $\tau_t \simeq 1.2(1)$, away from
experimental values for the brain. Additionally, we changed the signs of

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Structural Associations of Cortical Contrast and Thickness in First Episode Psychosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz040</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz040/5371084?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is growing evidence that psychosis is characterized by brain network abnormalities. Analyzing morphological abnormalities with T1-weighted structural MRI may be limited in discovering the extent of deviations in cortical associations. We assess whether structural associations of either cortical white–gray contrast (WGC) or cortical thickness (CT) allow for a better understanding of brain structural relationships in first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients. Principal component and structural covariance analyses were applied to WGC and CT derived from T1-weighted MRI for 116 patients and 88 controls, to explore sets of brain regions that showed group differences, and associations with symptom severity and cognitive ability in patients. We focused on 2 principal components: one encompassed primary somatomotor regions, which showed trend-like group differences in WGC, and the second included heteromodal cortices. Patients’ component scores were related to general psychopathology for WGC, but not CT. Structural covariance analyses with WGC revealed group differences in pairwise correlations across widespread brain regions, mirroring areas derived from PCA. More group differences were uncovered with WGC compared with CT. WGC holds potential as a proxy measure of myelin from commonly acquired T1-weighted MRI and may be sensitive in detecting systems-level aberrations in early psychosis, and relationships with clinical/cognitive profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spatial Patterns of Brain Activity Preferentially Reflecting Transient Pain and Stimulus Intensity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz026</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How pain emerges in the human brain remains an unresolved question. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that several brain areas subserve pain perception because their activation correlates with perceived pain intensity. However, painful stimuli are often intense and highly salient; therefore, using both intensity- and saliency-matched control stimuli is crucial to isolate pain-selective brain responses. Here, we used these intensity/saliency-matched painful and non-painful stimuli to test whether pain-selective information can be isolated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses elicited by painful stimuli. Using two independent datasets, multivariate pattern analysis was able to isolate features distinguishing the responses triggered by (1) intensity/saliency-matched painful versus non-painful stimuli, and (2) high versus low-intensity/saliency stimuli regardless of whether they elicit pain. This indicates that neural activity in the so-called “pain matrix” is functionally heterogeneous, and part of it carries information related to both painfulness and intensity/saliency. The response features distinguishing these aspects are spatially distributed and cannot be ascribed to specific brain structures.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Blood pressure variability and hemorrhagic transformation in patients with successful recanalization after endovascular recanalization therapy: A retrospective observational study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25434?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25434?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although blood pressure (BP) variability has been regarded as a risk factor for hemorrhagic transformation (HTF) after intravenous thrombolysis, its effect on HTF after endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to study the relationship between BP variability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after successful recanalization with ERT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 211 patients with acute ischemic stroke and successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b or 3) after ERT were included between January 2013 and May 2017. The BP data following ERT was obtained over the first 24 hours using parameters including mean, maximum, minimum, difference between maximum and minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, successive variations, and time rate (TR) of BP variation for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP. sICH was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 with neurological deterioration of 4 points of more on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the included patients, 20 (9.5%) developed sICH after successful ERT. The parameters linked with BP fluctuation over time were significantly related to sICH. After adjusting for confounders, the TR of SBP (per 0.1 mmHg/min increase) variation was independently associated with sICH (odds ratio = 1.71, 95% confidence interval = 1.013–2.886).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time‐related BP variability in the first 24 hours following successful ERT was more correlated with sICH than other absolute BP levels. This suggests that maintaining a stable BP may be an important factor in preventing sICH after successful ERT. Ann Neurol 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate‐receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis related to autoantibody‐mediated synaptic dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid‐derived human monoclonal NR1 autoantibodies showed low numbers of somatic hypermutations or were unmutated. These unexpected germline‐configured antibodies showed weaker binding to the NMDAR than matured antibodies from the same patient. In primary hippocampal neurons, germline NR1 autoantibodies strongly and specifically reduced total and synaptic NMDAR currents in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. The findings suggest that functional NMDAR antibodies are part of the human naïve B cell repertoire. Given their effects on synaptic function, they might contribute to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25458?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1) is the key endogenous inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and enhances clot formation after injury. In traumatic brain injury, dysregulation of fibrinolysis may lead to sustained microthrombosis and accelerated lesion expansion. In the present study, we hypothesized that PAI‐1 mediates posttraumatic malfunction of coagulation, with inhibition or genetic depletion of PAI‐1 attenuating clot formation and lesion expansion after brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated PAI‐1 as a possible new target in a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We performed the pharmacological inhibition of PAI‐1 with PAI‐039 and stimulation by tranexamic acid, and we confirmed our results in PAI‐1‐deficient animals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAI‐1 mRNA was time‐dependently upregulated, with a 305‐fold peak 12h after CCI, which effectively counteracted the 2 to 3‐fold increase in cerebral tissue‐type/urokinase plasminogen activator (tPA/uPA) expression. PAI‐039 reduced brain lesion volume by 26% at 24h, and 43% at 5d, after insult. This treatment also attenuated neuronal apoptosis and improved neurofunctional outcome. Moreover, intravital microscopy demonstrated reduced posttraumatic thrombus formation in the pericontusional cortical microvasculature. In PAI‐1‐deficient mice, the therapeutic effect of PAI‐039 was absent. These mice also displayed 13% reduced brain damage compared with wild‐type. In contrast, inhibition of fibrinolysis with tranexamic acid increased lesion volume by 25% compared with vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study identifies impaired fibrinolysis as a critical process in posttraumatic secondary brain damage and suggests that PAI‐1 may be a central endogenous inhibitor of the fibrinolytic pathway, promoting a pro‐coagulatory state and clot formation in the cerebral microvasculature.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Repetitive Diffuse Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Causes an Atypical Astrocyte Response and Spontaneous Recurrent Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/10/1944?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces astrogliosis, a process essential to protecting uninjured brain areas from secondary damage. However, astrogliosis can cause loss of astrocyte homeostatic functions and possibly contributes to comorbidities such as posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Scar-forming astrocytes seal focal injuries off from healthy brain tissue. It is these glial scars that are associated with epilepsy originating in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, the vast majority of human TBIs also present with diffuse brain injury caused by acceleration-deceleration forces leading to tissue shearing. The resulting diffuse tissue damage may be intrinsically different from focal lesions that would trigger glial scar formation. Here, we used mice of both sexes in a model of repetitive mild/concussive closed-head TBI, which only induced diffuse injury, to test the hypothesis that astrocytes respond uniquely to diffuse TBI and that diffuse TBI is sufficient to cause PTE. Astrocytes did not form scars and classic astrogliosis characterized by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was limited. Surprisingly, an unrelated population of atypical reactive astrocytes was characterized by the lack of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, rapid and sustained downregulation of homeostatic proteins and impaired astrocyte coupling. After a latency period, a subset of mice developed spontaneous recurrent seizures reminiscent of PTE in human TBI patients. Seizing mice had larger areas of atypical astrocytes compared with nonseizing mice, suggesting that these atypical astrocytes might contribute to epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired epilepsies. Reactive astrocytes have long been associated with seizures and epilepsy in patients, particularly after focal/lesional brain injury. However, most TBIs also include nonfocal, diffuse injuries. Here, we showed that repetitive diffuse TBI is sufficient for the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in a subset of mice. We identified an atypical response of astrocytes induced by diffuse TBI characterized by the rapid loss of homeostatic proteins and lack of astrocyte coupling while reactive astrocyte markers or glial scar formation was absent. Areas with atypical astrocytes were larger in animals that later developed seizures suggesting that this response may be one root cause of epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neuronal Apolipoprotein E4 increases cell death and p‐tau release in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25455?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25455?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 isoform is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). While APOE is predominantly expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of APOE is of increasing interest in age‐related cognitive impairment, neurological injury, and neurodegeneration. Here we show that endogenous expression of E4 in stem‐cell derived neurons predisposes them to injury and promotes the release of phosphorylated tau.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induced pluripotent stem cells from two unrelated Alzheimer's disease patients carrying the E4 allele were corrected to the E3/E3 genotype with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and differentiated into pure cultures of forebrain excitatory neurons without contamination from other cells types.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to unedited E4 neurons, E3 neurons were less susceptible to ionomycin‐induced cytotoxicity. Biochemically, E4 cells exhibited increased tau phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphoactivation. Moreover, E4 neurons released increased amounts of phosphorylated tau extracellularly in an isoform dependent manner by a heparin sulfate proteoglycan‐dependent mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that endogenous expression of E4 by stem‐cell derived forebrain excitatory neurons predisposes neurons to calcium dysregulation, and ultimately, cell death. This change is associated with increased cellular tau phosphorylation and markedly enhanced release of phosphorylated tau. Importantly, these effects are independent of glial APOE. These findings suggest that E4 accelerates spreading of tau pathology and neuron death in part by neuron‐specific, glia‐independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether hemodynamic features of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS) might correlate with the risk of stroke relapse, using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cohort study, we recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke attributed to 50‐99% ICAS confirmed in CT angiography (CTA). With CTA‐based CFD models, translesional pressure ratio (PR =&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Pressure&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;post&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;stenotic&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Pressure&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;pre&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;stenotic&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;) and translesional wall shear stress ratio (WSSR =&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;WSS&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;stenotic&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;throat&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;WSS&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;pre&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;stenotic&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;) were obtained in each sICAS lesion. Translesional PR ≤ median was defined as low PR and WSSR ≥ 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quartile as high WSSR. All patients received standard medical treatment. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the same territory (SIT) within 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 245 patients (median age 61 years; 63.7% males) were analyzed. Median translesional PR was 0.94 (interquartile range, IQR 0.87‐0.97); median translesional WSSR was 13.3 (IQR 7.0‐26.7). SIT occurred in 20 (8.2%) patients, mostly with multiple infarcts in the borderzone and/or cortical regions. In multivariate Cox regression, low PR (adjusted hazard ratio, HR=3.16; p=0.026) and high WSSR (adjusted HR=3.05; p=0.014) were independently associated with SIT. Patients with both low PR and high WSSR had significantly higher risk of SIT than those with normal PR and WSSR (risks 17.5% versus 3.0%; adjusted HR=7.52; p=0.004).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work represents a step forward in utilizing computational flow simulation techniques in studying intracranial atherosclerotic disease. It reveals a hemodynamic pattern of sICAS that is more prone to stroke relapse, and supports hypoperfusion and artery‐to‐artery embolism as common mechanisms for ischemic strokes in such patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Approximations of Shannon Mutual Information for Discrete Variables with Applications to Neural Population Coding. (arXiv:1903.01500v1 [cs.IT])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01500</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01500</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although Shannon mutual information has been widely used, its effective
calculation is often difficult for many practical problems, including those in
neural population coding. Asymptotic formulas based on Fisher information
sometimes provide accurate approximations to the mutual information but this
approach is restricted to continuous variables because the calculation of
Fisher information requires derivatives with respect to the encoded variables.
In this paper, we consider information-theoretic bounds and approximations of
the mutual information based on Kullback--Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi
divergence. We propose several information metrics to approximate Shannon
mutual information in the context of neural population coding. While our
asymptotic formulas all work for discrete variables, one of them has consistent
performance and high accuracy regardless of whether the encoded variables are
discrete or continuous. We performed numerical simulations and confirmed that
our approximation formulas were highly accurate for approximating the mutual
information between the stimuli and the responses of a large neural population.
These approximation formulas may potentially bring convenience to the
applications of information theory to many practical and theoretical problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural network models can now recognise images, understand text, translate
languages, and play many human games at human or superhuman levels. These
systems are highly abstracted, but are inspired by biological brains and use
only biologically plausible computations. In the coming years, neural networks
are likely to become less reliant on learning from massive labelled datasets,
and more robust and generalisable in their task performance. From their
successes and failures, we can learn about the computational requirements of
the different tasks at which brains excel. Deep learning also provides the
tools for testing cognitive theories. In order to test a theory, we need to
realise the proposed information-processing system at scale, so as to be able
to assess its feasibility and emergent behaviours. Deep learning allows us to
scale up from principles and circuit models to end-to-end trainable models
capable of performing complex tasks. There are many levels at which cognitive
neuroscientists can use deep learning in their work, from inspiring theories to
serving as full computational models. Ongoing advances in deep learning bring
us closer to understanding how cognition and perception may be implemented in
the brain -- the grand challenge at the core of cognitive neuroscience.

Targeted DamID (TaDa) is proving invaluable in identifying the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin-associated proteins &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, without fixation, cell isolation, or immunoprecipitation. The simplicity and efficiency of the technique have led to an ever-expanding TaDa toolbox. These tools enable profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the identification of the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin complexes, transcription factors and RNAs. Here, we review these new developments, with particular emphasis on the use of TaDa in studying neuronal specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The occurrence of wake-like electroencephalography (EEG) traces during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) has intrigued scientists for decades. A recent study by Bergel et al. (Nat. Commun. 2018;9;5364) imaged brain-wide hemodynamics in rats during wakefulness and sleep. The findings suggest that brain energy expenditure is highest during REM because of heightened theta and gamma activity.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Poly-Glutamine Region in the Drosophila VAChT Dictates Fill-Level of Cholinergic Synaptic Vesicles</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs), accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the VAChT to include regulating the transmitter content of SVs. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (&lt;i&gt;13Q&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;12Q&lt;/i&gt;), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (&lt;i&gt;13Q&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;14Q&lt;/i&gt;) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked SV release. Finally, a complete deletion of the polyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure SVs are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day (P)11 and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;2Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here, we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High  frequency activity (65–115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high  power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect (SME) between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the early visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Verbal fluency is affected by altered brain lateralisation in adults who were born very preterm</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Language difficulties have been reported in children and adolescents who were born very preterm (&amp;lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and associated with an atypical lateralisation of language processing, i.e. increased right-hemispheric engagement. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spherical deconvolution tractography to study the hemodynamic responses associated with verbal fluency processing (easy and hard letter trials) and verbal fluency-related white matter fibre tracts in 64 very preterm born adults and 36 adult controls (mean age: 30 years). Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and frontal aslant tract (FAT) was performed. Tracts were quantified in terms of mean volume, hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy, and lateralisation, assessed using a laterality index to indicate hemispheric dominance. During verbal fluency fMRI, very preterm participants displayed decreased hemodynamic response suppression in both the &lt;i&gt;Easy &amp;gt; Rest&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hard &amp;gt; Rest&lt;/i&gt; conditions, compared to controls, in superior temporal gyrus, insula, thalamus and sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere. At the whole-group level, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the AF was present alongside increased right hemispheric hemodynamic response suppression in controls. When only right-handed participants were considered, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right superior temporal gyrus during hard letter trials was related to weaker left and right FAT white matter integrity in the preterm group only. These results show that verbal fluency is affected by altered functional lateralisation in adults who were born very preterm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study to use both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neuro-anatomy of verbal fluency in very preterm born adults. Less suppression of brain activation was observed in very preterm adults compared to controls in several brain regions during completion of both easy and hard verbal fluency trials. Furthermore, across all subjects, decreased brain activity suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the arcuate fasciculus, a language-related white matter tract, was present alongside increased right hemispheric brain activity suppression in controls. These findings suggest that alterations in the typical development of left-lateralisation in very preterm individuals are still present in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Echoes of emotions past: How neuromodulators determine what we recollect</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We tend to re-live emotional experiences more richly in memory than more mundane experiences. According to one recent neurocognitive model of emotional memory, negative events may be encoded with a larger amount of sensory information than neutral and positive events. As a result, there may be more perceptual information available to reconstruct these events at retrieval, leading to memory reinstatement patterns that correspond with greater memory vividness and sense of recollection for negative events. In this commentary, we offer an alternative perspective on how emotion may influence such sensory cortex reinstatement that focuses on engagement of the noradrenergic (NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems rather than valence. Specifically, we propose that arousal-related LC-NE system activation promotes the prioritization of the most salient features of an emotional experience in memory. Thus, a select few details may drive lower-level sensory cortical activity and a stronger sense of recollection for arousing events. By contrast, states of high behavioral activation, including novelty-seeking and exploration, may recruit the DA system to broaden the scope of cognitive processing and integrate multiple event aspects in memory. These more integrated memory representations may be reflected in higher-order cortical reinstatement at retrieval. Thus, the balance between activation in these neuromodulatory systems at encoding, rather than the valence of the event, may ultimately determine the quality of emotional memory recollection and neural reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Section&lt;/b&gt; We tend to re-live emotional events more richly in memory than mundane experiences. Recent research suggests that emotional memory enhancements, particularly for negative events, emerge from greater reactivation of sensory information during retrieval. Here, we offer an account of how emotion influences such sensory cortex reinstatement that focuses on how activation of the noradrenergic (NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems may impact the quality of recollection. We propose that NE system activation promotes the prioritization of the most salient features of an event in memory, whereas DA system activation promotes the integration of multiple event features in memory. Thus, the balance between activation in these systems might determine how we encode and later re-experience our most significant events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to examine the
association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex traits,
where both the sample size n and the number of SNPs p can be very large.
Recently, cross-trait polygenic risk score (PRS) method has gained extremely
popular for assessing genetic correlation of complex traits based on GWAS
summary statistics (e.g., SNP effect size). However, empirical evidence has
shown a common bias phenomenon that even highly significant cross-trait PRS can
only account for a very small amount of genetic variance (R^2 often &amp;lt;1%). The
aim of this paper is to develop a novel and powerful method to address the bias
phenomenon of cross-trait PRS. We theoretically show that the estimated genetic
correlation is asymptotically biased towards zero when complex traits are
highly polygenic/omnigenic. When all p SNPs are used to construct PRS, we show
that the asymptotic bias of PRS estimator is independent of the unknown number
of causal SNPs m. We propose a consistent PRS estimator to correct such
asymptotic bias. We also develop a novel estimator of genetic correlation which
is solely based on two sets of GWAS summary statistics. In addition, we
investigate whether or not SNP screening by GWAS p-values can lead to improved
estimation and show the effect of overlapping samples among GWAS. Our results
may help demystify and tackle the puzzling &quot;missing genetic overlap&quot; phenomenon
of cross-trait PRS for dissecting the genetic similarity of closely related
heritable traits. We illustrate the finite sample performance of our
bias-corrected PRS estimator by using both numerical experiments and the UK
Biobank data, in which we assess the genetic correlation between brain white
matter tracts and neuropsychiatric disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolution has produced a multi-scale mosaic of interacting adaptive units.
Innovations arise when perturbations push parts of the system away from stable
equilibria into new regimes where previously well-adapted solutions no longer
work. Here we explore the hypothesis that multi-agent systems sometimes display
intrinsic dynamics arising from competition and cooperation that provide a
naturally emergent curriculum, which we term an autocurriculum. The solution of
one social task often begets new social tasks, continually generating novel
challenges, and thereby promoting innovation. Under certain conditions these
challenges may become increasingly complex over time, demanding that agents
accumulate ever more innovations.

	<title>RSS PAP: The rat medial prefrontal cortex exhibits flexible neural activity states during the performance of an odor span task</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is fundamental for working memory (WM), attention, and behavioral inhibition; however, a comprehensive understanding of the neural computations underlying these processes is still forthcoming. Towards this goal, neural recordings were obtained from the mPFC of awake, behaving rats performing an odor span task of WM capacity. Neural populations were observed to encode distinct task epochs and the transitions between epochs were accompanied by abrupt shifts in neural activity patterns. Putative pyramidal neuron activity increased earlier in the delay for sessions where rats achieved higher spans. Furthermore, increased putative interneuron activity was only observed at the termination of the delay thus indicating that local processing in inhibitory networks was a unique feature to initiate foraging. During foraging, changes in neural activity patterns associated with the approach to a novel odor, but not familiar odors, were robust. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct mPFC activity states underlie the delay, foraging, and reward epochs of the odor span task. Transitions between these states enable successful performance in dynamic environments placing strong demands on the substrates of working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Working memory capacity is altered in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. In the present manuscript, we describe activity states of neurons in medial prefrontal cortex as well-trained rats perform the odor span task, which has been nominated as a task suitable for studying working memory capacity in rodents. Our results demonstrate dynamic and flexible activity patters during different epochs of the task (i.e., the delay period, foraging, reward collection, and after making errors). Our results bolster contemporary theories of the medial prefrontal cortex exhibiting metastable dynamics in complex environments. Disruptions in these dynamics may underlie some cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, including reduced working memory capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Extrafield activity shifts the place field center of mass to encode aversive experience</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are known to have a key role in encoding spatial information. Aversive stimuli, such as predator odor, evoke place field remapping and a change in preferred firing locations. However, it remains unclear how place cells use positive or negative experiences to remap. We investigated whether CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or whether their reconfiguration depends on the perceived location of the aversive stimulus. Exposure to trimethylthiazoline (TMT, an innately aversive odor), increased the amplitude of hippocampal beta oscillations in the two arms of the maze in which TMT exposure occurred. We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extrafield spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. Moreover, in the subsequent post-TMT recording, these cells exhibited a significant shift in their center of mass towards the TMT arms. The induction of extrafield plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized hippocampal local field oscillations and increased the extrafield spiking of the hippocampal place cells for the first 100 ms after light delivery. Optogenetic BLA activation triggered an increase in extrafield spiking activity that was correlated with the degree of place field plasticity. Furthermore, BLA-mediated increase of the extrafield activity predicts the degree of subsequent field plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that that the remapping of hippocampal place cells during aversive episodes is not random but it depends on the location of the aversive stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Here, we successfully decoded the pattern of place field reconfiguration to an aversive experience after exposure to an innately aversive odor. For the first time, we reveal that the degree of place field plasticity closely correlates with the extrafield spiking rate during aversive episodes. Using a spatial optogenetic technique in behaving rats, we show that the link between aversive behavior and place field reconfiguration is mediated by the spatially confined activation of the basolateral amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus not only maps the spatial environment but also stores the affective value of experienced events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;13 Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as doublecortex syndrome,
is a 14 malformation of cortical development resulting from mutations in the
doublecortin gene 15 (DCX). It is characterized by a lack of migration of
cortical neurons that accumulate in the 16 white matter forming a heterotopic
band. Patients with SBH may present mild to moderate 17 intellectual disability
as well as epilepsy. The SBH condition can be modeled in rats by in 18 utero
knockdown (KD) of Dcx. The affected cells form an SBH reminiscent of that
observed in 19 human patients and the animals develop a chronic epileptic
condition in adulthood. Here, 20 we investigated if the presence of an SBH is
sufficient to induce cognitive impairment in 21

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Directly Represses Dbx1 to Confine the POA and Subsequently Regulate Ventral Telencephalic Patterning</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During early development, signaling centers, such as the cortical hem and the preoptic area (POA), are critical for telencephalic patterning. However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of signal centers are poorly understood. Here, we report that the transcription factor &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; is required to confine the POA, a resource of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sonic Hedgehog&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Shh)&lt;/span&gt; that is pivotal for ventral telencephalic development. Cell-specific deletion of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; achieved by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dbx1-cre&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nestin-CreER&lt;/span&gt; combined with tamoxifen induction results in a dramatic expansion of the POA accompanied by the significantly increased activity of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Shh&lt;/span&gt; signaling pathway. Ventral pattern formation was severely impaired. Moreover, we demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; directly represses &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dbx1&lt;/span&gt; to restrict the POA. Furthermore, we found that the ventral pallium was expanded, which might also contribute to the observed patterning defects. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of signal centers and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ventral telencephalic patterning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: HuR in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex is Critical for Stress-Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Depressive-Like Symptoms in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Chronic stress has been observed to increase the risk of developing depression and induce neuronal alterations of synaptic plasticity, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR was up-regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice following chronic stress. In adult mice, AAV-Cre-mediated knockout of HuR in the mPFC prevented anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. HuR was also required for the stress-induced dendritic spine loss and synaptic transmission deficits. Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;HuR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;flox/flox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nex-Cre&lt;/span&gt; mice, which induce HuR loss of function from embryonic development, exhibited enhanced synaptic functions. Notably, we ascertained RhoA signaling to be regulated by HuR and involved in the modulation of structural synaptic plasticity in response to chronic stress. Our results demonstrate HuR is a critical modulator for the regulation of stress-induced synaptic plasticity alterations and depression, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

One such gene is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/span&gt; encoding contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), which harbours mutations associated to autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Antibodies targeting CASPR2 have also been recently described in patients with several neurological disorders, such as neuromyotonia, Morvan’s syndrome, and limbic encephalitis. Despite the clear implication of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/span&gt; and CASPR2 in neuropsychiatric disorders, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with alterations in CASPR2 function are unknown. Here, we show that Caspr2 is expressed in excitatory synapses in the cortex, and that silencing its expression &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt; decreases the synaptic expression of α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methylisoxazole‐4‐propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Furthermore, Caspr2 loss of function blocks synaptic scaling &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt; and experience-dependent homoeostatic synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Patient CASPR2 antibodies decrease the dendritic levels of Caspr2 and synaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, and perturb excitatory transmission in the visual cortex. These results suggest that mutations in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/span&gt; may contribute to alterations in AMPA receptor function and homoeostatic plasticity, and indicate that antibodies from anti-CASPR2 encephalitis patients affect cortical excitatory transmission.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Emergence of Hierarchical Somatosensory Processing in Late Prematurity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz030</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz030/5370832?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The somatosensory system has a hierarchical organization. Information processing increases in complexity from the contralateral primary sensory cortex to bilateral association cortices and this is represented by a sequence of somatosensory-evoked potentials recorded with scalp electroencephalographies. The mammalian somatosensory system matures over the early postnatal period in a rostro-caudal progression, but little is known about the development of hierarchical information processing in the human infant brain. To investigate the normal human development of the somatosensory hierarchy, we recorded potentials evoked by mechanical stimulation of hands and feet in 34 infants between 34 and 42 weeks corrected gestational age, with median postnatal age of 3 days. We show that the shortest latency potential was evoked for both hands and feet at all ages with a contralateral somatotopic source in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, the longer latency responses, localized in SI and beyond, matured with age. They gradually emerged for the foot and, although always present for the hand, showed a shift from purely contralateral to bilateral hemispheric activation. These results demonstrate the rostro-caudal development of human somatosensory hierarchy and suggest that the development of its higher tiers is complete only just before the time of normal birth.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Overlapping Anatomical Networks Convey Cross-Modal Suppression in the Sighted and Coactivation of “Visual” and Auditory Cortex in the Blind</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz021</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz021/5370680?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the present combined DTI/fMRI study we investigated adaptive plasticity of neural networks involved in controlling spatial and nonspatial auditory working memory in the early blind (EB). In both EB and sighted controls (SC), fractional anisotropy (FA) within the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus correlated positively with accuracy in a one-back sound localization but not sound identification task. The neural tracts passing through the cluster of significant correlation connected auditory and “visual” areas in the right hemisphere. Activity in these areas during both sound localization and identification correlated with FA within the anterior corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. In EB, FA in these structures correlated positively with activity in both auditory and “visual” areas, whereas FA in SC correlated positively with activity in auditory and negatively with activity in visual areas. The results indicate that frontal white matter conveys cross-modal suppression of occipital areas in SC, while it mediates coactivation of auditory and reorganized “visual” cortex in EB.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The development of neural manipulation and mapping tools has opened up new avenues to dissect the neural circuits underlying body fluid regulation. Recent studies have identified several nodes in the brain that positively and negatively regulate thirst. The next step forward would be to elucidate how neural populations interact with each other to control drinking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In recent years, comparative single-cell transcriptomics has opened up new research avenues addressing these issues. Here, we review recent conceptual progress toward an evolutionary definition of cell types, and how it facilitates the identification and large-scale comparison of neuronal types and neuron type families from single-cell data — with the family of GABAergic neurons in distinct parts of the vertebrate forebrain as prime example. We also highlight strategies to infer cell type-specific innovation, so-called apomeres, from single-cell data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Single-cell sequencing studies show that different neuronal cell types express distinct combinations of cell-surface proteins important for synaptic connectivity and function. Emerging evidence indicates that glia-derived cell-surface proteins play critical roles in shaping connectivity as well. These studies begin to suggest that the proteins present on presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, glial processes, and secreted into the synaptic cleft and extracellular matrix together confer unique surface identities to different types of synaptic connections. Here, we summarize recent findings demonstrating that cell-surface proteins derived from both neurons and glia interact and cooperate to control the connectivity, architecture and function of specific synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The neural circuits that integrate higher order commands from the brain and generate motor outputs are located in the nerve cord of the central nervous system. Recently, genetic access to distinct functional subtypes that make up the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; adult ventral nerve cord has significantly begun to advance our understanding of the structural organization and functions of the neural circuits coordinating motor outputs. Moreover, lineage-tracing and genetic intersection tools have been instrumental in deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate and assemble the functional units of the adult nerve cord. Together, the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; adult ventral nerve cord is emerging as a powerful system to understand the development and function of neural circuits that are responsible for coordinating complex motor outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces a model-agnostic approach to study statistical
synergy, a form of emergence in which patterns at large scales are not
traceable from lower scales. Our framework leverages various multivariate
extensions of Shannon's mutual information, and introduces the O-information as
a metric capable of characterising synergy- and redundancy-dominated systems.
We develop key analytical properties of the O-information, and study how it
relates to other metrics of high-order interactions from the statistical
mechanics and neuroscience literature. Finally, as a proof of concept, we use
the proposed framework to explore the relevance of statistical synergy in
Baroque music scores.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Antagonizes Neocortical Stem Cell Progression to Astrogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz031</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz031/5368120?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neocortical astrogenesis follows neuronogenesis and precedes oligogenesis. Among key factors dictating its temporal articulation, there are progression rates of pallial stem cells (SCs) towards astroglial lineages as well as activation rates of astrocyte differentiation programs in response to extrinsic gliogenic cues. In this study, we showed that high Foxg1 SC expression antagonizes astrocyte generation, while stimulating SC self-renewal and committing SCs to neuronogenesis. We found that mechanisms underlying this activity are mainly cell autonomous and highly pleiotropic. They include a concerted downregulation of 4 key effectors channeling neural SCs to astroglial fates, as well as defective activation of core molecular machineries implementing astroglial differentiation programs. Next, we found that SC Foxg1 levels specifically decline during the neuronogenic-to-gliogenic transition, pointing to a pivotal Foxg1 role in temporal modulation of astrogenesis. Finally, we showed that Foxg1 inhibits astrogenesis from human neocortical precursors, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient trait.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Lateral Habenular Burst Firing as a Target of the Rapid Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30315-1?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.</description>

However, potential differences in the connectivity patterns of the rich-club organization of hemispheric structural networks in females and males remain to be determined. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct hemispheric structural networks in healthy subjects, and graph theoretical analysis approaches were applied to quantify hemisphere and gender differences in rich-club organization. The results showed that rich-club organization was consistently observed in both hemispheres of female and male adults. Moreover, a reduced level of connectivity was found in the left hemisphere. Notably, rightward asymmetries were mainly observed in feeder and local connections among one hub region and peripheral regions, many of which are implicated in visual processing and spatial attention functions. Additionally, significant gender differences were revealed in the rich-club, feeder, and local connections in rich-club organization. These gender-related hub and peripheral regions are involved in emotional, sensory, and cognitive control functions. The topological changes in rich-club organization provide novel insight into the hemisphere and gender effects on white matter connections and underlie a potential network mechanism of hemisphere- and gender-based differences in visual processing, spatial attention and cognitive control.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Preventing a Thought from Coming to Mind Elicits Increased Right Frontal Beta Just as Stopping Action Does</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz017</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz017/5365268?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the stop-signal task, an electrophysiological signature of action-stopping is increased early right frontal beta band power for successful vs. failed stop trials. Here we tested whether the requirement to stop an unwanted thought from coming to mind also elicits this signature. We recorded scalp EEG during a Think/No-Think task and a subsequent stop signal task in 42 participants. In the Think/No-Think task, participants first learned word pairs. In a second phase, they received the left-hand word as a reminder and were cued either to retrieve the associated right-hand word (“Think”) or to stop retrieval (“No-Think”). At the end of each trial, participants reported whether they had experienced an intrusion of the associated memory. Finally, they received the left-hand reminder word and were asked to recall its associated target. Behaviorally, there was worse final recall for items in the No-Think condition, and decreased intrusions with practice for No-Think trials. For EEG, we reproduced increased early right frontal beta power for successful vs. failed action stopping. Critically, No-Think trials also elicited increased early right frontal beta power and this was stronger for trials without intrusion. These results suggest that preventing a thought from coming to mind also recruits fast prefrontal stopping.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Distinct Structure of Cortical Population Activity on Fast and Infraslow Timescales</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz023</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz023/5364043?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical activity is organized across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Most research on the dynamics of neuronal spiking is concerned with timescales of 1 ms–1 s, and little is known about spiking dynamics on timescales of tens of seconds and minutes. Here, we used frequency domain analyses to study the structure of individual neurons’ spiking activity and its coupling to local population rate and to arousal level across 0.01–100 Hz frequency range. In mouse medial prefrontal cortex, the spiking dynamics of individual neurons could be quantitatively captured by a combination of interspike interval and firing rate power spectrum distributions. The relative strength of coherence with local population often differed across timescales: a neuron strongly coupled to population rate on fast timescales could be weakly coupled on slow timescales, and vice versa. On slow but not fast timescales, a substantial proportion of neurons showed firing anticorrelated with the population. Infraslow firing rate changes were largely determined by arousal rather than by local factors, which could explain the timescale dependence of individual neurons’ population coupling strength. These observations demonstrate how neurons simultaneously partake in fast local dynamics, and slow brain-wide dynamics, extending our understanding of infraslow cortical activity beyond the mesoscale resolution of fMRI.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Learning Promotes Subfield-Specific Synaptic Diversity in Hippocampal CA1 Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz022</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz022/5364044?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampus is functionally heterogeneous between the dorsal and ventral subfields with left–right asymmetry. To determine the possible location of contextual memory, we performed an inhibitory avoidance task to analyze synaptic plasticity using slice patch-clamp technique. The training bilaterally increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio at dorsal CA3–CA1 synapses, whereas the training did not affect the ratio at ventral CA3–CA1 synapses regardless of the hemisphere. Moreover, sequential recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents from the same CA1 neuron clearly showed learning-induced synaptic plasticity. In dorsal CA1 neurons, the training dramatically strengthened both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in both hemispheres, whereas the training did not promote the plasticity in either hemisphere in ventral CA1 neurons. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis further revealed that the training bilaterally increased the number of AMPA or GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor channels at dorsal CA1 synapses, but not at ventral CA1 synapses, suggesting functional heterogeneity of learning-induced receptor mobility. Finally, the performance clearly impaired by the bilateral microinjection of plasticity blockers in dorsal, but not ventral CA1 subfields, suggesting a crucial role for contextual learning. The quantification of synaptic diversity in specified CA1 subfields may help us to diagnose and evaluate cognitive disorders at the information level.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Hippocampal Interaction With Area 25, but not Area 32, Regulates Marmoset Approach–Avoidance Behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Affective disorders are associated with increased sensitivity to negative feedback that influences approach–avoidance decision making. Although neuroimaging studies of these disorders reveal dysregulation in primate cingulate areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp), the causal involvement of these structures and their interaction in the primate brain is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of localized pharmacological manipulations of areas 25 and 32 and/or the aHipp of the marmoset monkey on performance of an anxiolytic-sensitive instrumental decision-making task in which an approach–avoidance conflict is created by pairing a response with reward and punishment. During control infusions animals avoided punishment, but this bias was reduced by increasing glutamate release within the aHipp or area 32, and inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25. Conversely, increasing glutamate release in area 25 enhanced punishment avoidance but, in contrast to previous reports, area 32 and aHipp inactivations had no effect. Simultaneous inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25, but not area 32, abolished the reduced punishment avoidance seen after increasing aHipp glutamate. Besides providing causal evidence that these primate areas differentially regulate negative feedback sensitivity, this study links the decision-making deficits in affective disorders to aberrant aHipp–area 25 circuit activity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.</description>

This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>ScienceDirect Publication: Current Opinion in Neurobiology: Vesicular degradation pathways in neurons: at the crossroads of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: August 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): C Alexander Boecker, Erika LF Holzbaur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation are two parallel degradation pathways essential for maintaining neuronal health and function. Autophagosomes and endosomes sequester cellular cargo through different mechanisms, but these pathways converge upon fusion with lysosomes. Both pathways are spatially regulated, with distinct features evident in the soma, axons, and dendrites, possibly as an adaptation to the unique morphology of neurons and the specific demands of each compartment. Relatively little is known about how autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation interact and how their activities may be coordinated. We review our current understanding of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation in neurons, highlighting common features and differences as well as the intersection of these two essential cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Septins now emerge as key players of neurodevelopment and more specifically of the mechanisms driving the complex morphological differentiation and compartmentalization of neurons that are fundamental to their function. We review here recent advances in Septin-mediated processes of neuron differentiation, which enlighten similarities and differences between neuron and yeast polarity programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>ScienceDirect Publication: Current Opinion in Neurobiology: Molecular constituents and localization of the ionotropic GABA receptor complex in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: August 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Susumu Tomita&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ionotropic GABA receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) mediates fast inhibition in the brain. The GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R pore-forming (α, β, and non-α/β) subunits were isolated approximately 30 years ago and have since been the focus of extensive studies. As a result, many properties of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, including subunit assembly and channel and pharmacological properties, have been discovered. However, several of the underlying mechanisms such as the process for the synaptic localization of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs remain unsolved. A reinvestigation of native GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R complexes in the brain and primary neurons identified two major molecular constituents, namely, the transmembrane GARLH/LHFPL protein family and the inhibitory synaptic protein neuroligin 2. This identification of the principal components of native receptor complexes may provide new mechanistic insight on receptor regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
