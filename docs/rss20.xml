	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Weighted correlated component analysis for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCI. (arXiv:1812.10227v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Correlated component analysis (CORRCA) is a novel method for frequency
recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based
brain-computer interface (BCI), which holds the potential to implement
high-performance SSVEP-based BCI systems. CORRCA could provide multiple
correlation coefficients to measure the correlation between two signals.
However, only the largest one is selected as feature while ignoring all others
in previous study, which loses the discriminating information. In current
study, we proposed a weighting strategy with nonlinear function to combine all
the correlation coefficients to enhance the performance of CORRCA method.
Extensive experimental results on a benchmark dataset of thirty-five subjects
indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the original CORRCA
method. This study demonstrates that the proposed method could be a good choice
for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCI systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common approach to modeling dynamic connectivity in resting-state
whole-brain fMRI is to compute (across moving temporal windows) the
Pearson-correlation between anatomical regions derived from predefined brain
parcellation. Due to image acquisition and physiological noise, the direct use
of the sample correlation matrices is not reliable for the subsequent modeling
of the dynamically-evolving connectivity matrices. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a new regression approach that smooths out the noise by exploiting
the geometric structure of correlation matrices. We demonstrate that the
proposed method is useful for identifying distinct state spaces in the
resting-state connectivities of males and females through the transition
matrices of the common states.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise is an inherent part of neuronal dynamics, and thus of the brain. It can
be observed in neuronal activity at different spatiotemporal scales, including
in neuronal membrane potentials, local field potentials,
electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. A central research topic in
contemporary neuroscience is to elucidate the functional role of noise in
neuronal information processing. Experimental studies have shown that a
suitable level of noise may enhance the detection of weak neuronal signals by
means of stochastic resonance. In response, theoretical research, based on the
theory of stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical physics,
has made great strides in elucidating the mechanism and the many benefits of
stochastic resonance in neuronal systems. In this perspective, we review recent
research dedicated to neuronal stochastic resonance in biophysical mathematical
models. We also explore the regulation of neuronal stochastic resonance, and we
outline important open questions and directions for future research. A deeper
understanding of neuronal stochastic resonance may afford us new insights into
the highly impressive information processing in the brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable similarities between deep neural networks (DNN) and
the human brain as shown in previous studies, the fact that DNNs still fall
behind humans in many visual tasks suggests that considerable differences still
exist between the two systems. To probe their dissimilarities, we leverage
adversarial noise (AN) and adversarial interference (AI) images that yield
distinct recognition performance in a prototypical DNN (AlexNet) and human
vision. The evoked activity by regular (RE) and adversarial images in both
systems is thoroughly compared. We find that representational similarity
between RE and adversarial images in the human brain resembles their perceptual
similarity. However, such representation-perception association is disrupted in
the DNN. Especially, the representational similarity between RE and AN images
idiosyncratically increases from low- to high-level layers. Furthermore,
forward encoding modeling reveals that the DNN-brain hierarchical
correspondence proposed in previous studies only holds when the two systems
process RE and AI images but not AN images. These results might be due to the
deterministic modeling approach of current DNNs. Taken together, our results
provide a complementary perspective on the comparison between DNNs and the
human brain, and highlight the need to characterize their differences to
further bridge artificial and human intelligence research.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Coarse-graining microscopic models of biological neural networks to obtain
mesoscopic models of neural activities is an essential step towards multi-scale
models of the brain. Here, we extend a recent theory for mesoscopic population
dynamics with static synapses to the case of dynamic synapses exhibiting
short-term plasticity (STP). Under the assumption that spike arrivals at
synapses have Poisson statistics, we derive analytically stochastic mean-field
dynamics for the effective synaptic coupling between finite-size populations
undergoing Tsodyks-Markram STP. The novel mean-field equations account for both
finite number of synapses and correlations between the neurotransmitter release
probability and the fraction of available synaptic resources. Comparisons with
Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic model show that in both feedforward
and recurrent networks the mesoscopic mean-field model accurately reproduces
stochastic realizations of the total synaptic input into a postsynaptic neuron
and accounts for stochastic switches between Up and Down states as well as for
population spikes. The extended mesoscopic population theory of spiking neural
networks with STP may be useful for a systematic reduction of detailed
biophysical models of cortical microcircuits to efficient and mathematically
tractable mean-field models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developing whole-brain emulation (WBE) technology would provide immense
benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and
robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility
due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However,
I suggest that progress towards this goal might be accelerated by working
towards an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More
specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of
entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of
non-neuronal insect physiology to make &quot;virtual insects.&quot; I argue that this is
realistically achievable within the next 25-50 years. I propose that developing
emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists,
businesspeople, and policymakers towards pursuing the loftier goal of emulating
the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating the
human brain will no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve
substantial funding and resources. This shift may facilitate a large-scale
organized push towards human WBE, making the goal potentially reachable during
the 21st century. By implementing IBE, large-scale scientific infrastructure
may shift towards developing more WBEs and move in the direction of
comprehensively understanding neural computation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Network topology of neural systems supporting avalanche dynamics predicts stimulus propagation and recovery. (arXiv:1812.09361v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09361</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09361</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neural systems display avalanche behavior characterized by uninterrupted
sequences of neuronal firing whose distributions of size and durations are
heavy-tailed. Theoretical models of such systems suggest that these dynamics
support optimal information transmission and storage. However, the unknown role
of network structure precludes an understanding of how variations in network
topology manifest in neural dynamics and either support or impinge upon
information processing. Here, using a generalized spiking model, we develop a
mechanistic understanding of how network topology supports information
processing through network dynamics. First, we show how network topology
determines network dynamics by analytically and numerically demonstrating that
network topology can be designed to propagate stimulus patterns for long
durations. We then identify strongly connected cycles as empirically observable
network motifs that are prevalent in such networks. Next, we show that within a
network, mathematical intuitions from network control theory are tightly linked
with dynamics initiated by node-specific stimulation and can identify stimuli
that promote long-lasting cascades. Finally, we use these network-based metrics
and control-based stimuli to demonstrate that long-lasting cascade dynamics
facilitate delayed recovery of stimulus patterns from network activity, as
measured by mutual information. Collectively, our results provide evidence that
cortical networks are structured with architectural motifs that support
long-lasting propagation and recovery of a few crucial patterns of stimulation,
especially those consisting of activity in highly controllable neurons.
Broadly, our results imply that avalanching neural networks could contribute to
cognitive faculties that require persistent activation of neuronal patterns,
such as working memory or attention.

Central questions to epigenome evolution include whether interspecies changes of histone modifications are independent of evolutionary changes of DNA, and if there is dependence whether they depend on any specific types of DNA sequence changes. Here, we present a likelihood approach for testing hypotheses on the co-evolution of genome and histone modifications. The gist of this approach is to convert evolutionary biology hypotheses into probabilistic forms, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications, which we refer to as a class of Joint Evolutionary Model for the Genome and the Epigenome (JEMGE). JEMGE can be summarized as a mixture model of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to underlying sequence substitutions and to underlying sequence insertions and deletions (indels). We implemented a maximum likelihood method to fit the models to the data. Based on comparison of likelihoods, we inferred whether interspecies epigenomic variations depended on substitution or indels in local genomic sequences based on DNase hypersensitivity and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited local-sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Substitutions accounted for less local-sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively. By initiating probabilistic formulation on the co-evolution of genomes and epigenomes, JEMGE helps to bring evolutionary biology principles to comparative epigenomic studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZM4wUNNtaVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

There are a huge number of pathogens with multi-component transmission cycles, involving amplifier hosts, vectors or complex pathogen life cycles. These complex systems present challenges in terms of modeling and policy development. A lethal tick-borne infectious disease, the Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), is a relevant example of that. The current increase of human cases of BSF has been associated with the presence and expansion of the capybara &lt;i&gt;Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris&lt;/i&gt;, amplifier host for the agent &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia rickettsii&lt;/i&gt; and primary host for the tick vector &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma sculptum&lt;/i&gt;. We introduce a stochastic dynamical model that captures the spatial distribution of capybaras and ticks to gain a better understanding of the spatial spread of the &lt;i&gt;R. rickettsii&lt;/i&gt; and potentially predict future epidemic outcomes. We implemented a reaction-diffusion process in which individuals were divided into classes denoting their state with respect to the disease. The model considered bidirectional movements between base and destination locations limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. We performed systematic stochastic simulations and numerical analysis of the model and investigate the impact of potential interventions to mitigate the spatial spread of the disease. The mobility of capybaras and their attached ticks was significantly influenced by the birth rate of capybaras and therefore, disease propagation velocity was higher in places with higher carrying capacity. Some geographical barriers, generated for example by riparian reforesting, can impede the spatial spread of BSF. The results of this work will allow the formulation of public actions focused on the prevention of BSF human cases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UUlMjPil1-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This paper presents a variational framework for dense diffeomorphic atlas-mapping onto high-throughput histology stacks at the 20 μm meso-scale. The observed sections are modelled as Gaussian random fields conditioned on a sequence of unknown section by section rigid motions and unknown diffeomorphic transformation of a three-dimensional atlas. To regularize over the high-dimensionality of our parameter space (which is a product space of the rigid motion dimensions and the diffeomorphism dimensions), the histology stacks are modelled as arising from a first order Sobolev space smoothness prior. We show that the joint maximum a-posteriori, penalized-likelihood estimator of our high dimensional parameter space emerges as a joint optimization interleaving rigid motion estimation for histology restacking and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to atlas coordinates. We show that joint optimization in this parameter space solves the classical curvature non-identifiability of the histology stacking problem. The algorithms are demonstrated on a collection of whole-brain histological image stacks from the Mouse Brain Architecture Project.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nxjhT-P0nDc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mechanism is a widely used concept in biology. In 2017, more than 10% of PubMed abstracts used the term. Therefore, searching for and reasoning about mechanisms is fundamental to much of biomedical research, but until now there has been almost no computational infrastructure for this purpose. Recent work in the philosophy of science has explored the central role that the search for mechanistic accounts of biological phenomena plays in biomedical research, providing a conceptual basis for representing and analyzing biological mechanism. The foundational categories for components of mechanisms—entities and activities—guide the development of general, abstract types of biological mechanism parts. Building on that analysis, we have developed a formal framework for describing and representing biological mechanism, MecCog, and applied it to describing mechanisms underlying human genetic disease. Mechanisms are depicted using a graphical notation. Key features are assignment of mechanism components to stages of biological organization and classes; visual representation of uncertainty, ignorance, and ambiguity; and tight integration with literature sources. The MecCog framework facilitates analysis of many aspects of disease mechanism, including the prioritization of future experiments, probing of gene−drug and gene−environment interactions, identification of possible new drug targets, personalized drug choice, analysis of nonlinear interactions between relevant genetic loci, and classification of diseases based on mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oqgpx4FsWtE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Research on human motor adaptation has often focused on how people adapt to self-generated or externally-influenced errors. &lt;i&gt;Trial-by-trial adaptation&lt;/i&gt; is a person’s response to self-generated errors. Externally-influenced errors applied as catch-trial perturbations are used to calculate a person’s &lt;i&gt;perturbation adaptation&lt;/i&gt; rate. Although these adaptation rates are sometimes compared to one another, we show through simulation and empirical data that the two metrics are distinct. We demonstrate that the trial-by-trial adaptation rate, often calculated as a coefficient in a linear regression, is biased under typical conditions. We tested 12 able-bodied subjects moving a cursor on a screen using a computer mouse. Statistically different adaptation rates arise when sub-sets of trials from different phases of learning are analyzed from within a sequence of movement results. We propose a new approach to identify when a person’s learning has stabilized in order to identify steady-state movement trials from which to calculate a more reliable trial-by-trial adaptation rate. Using a Bayesian model of human movement, we show that this analysis approach is more consistent and provides a more confident estimate than alternative approaches. Constraining analyses to steady-state conditions will allow researchers to better decouple the multiple concurrent learning processes that occur while a person makes goal-directed movements. Streamlining this analysis may help broaden the impact of motor adaptation studies, perhaps even enhancing their clinical usefulness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ASBzK5lPozA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cell-type specific changes in intrinsic excitability in the subiculum following learning and exposure to novel environmental contexts</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1, and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, though it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells–but not BS cells– displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures (afterhyperpolarization, input resistance, current required to elicit a spike), with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual fear conditioning followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The subiculum is the main output region of the hippocampus and contains two main neuron types: regular-spiking and burst-spiking. Here, we show that learning and novel context exposure induces plasticity in intrinsic excitability in regular-spiking cells of the subiculum, and that this plasticity predicts degree of learning of contextual fear conditioning. In contrast, we observed no significant learning-induced plasticity in intrinsic properties in subicular burst-spiking cells; however, we did observe an apparent conversion of burst-spiking to regular-spiking as evidenced by a greater proportion of regular-spiking neurons within the subiculum following learning. This suggests that the ratio of regular-spiking to burst-spiking neurons within the subiculum, together with enhanced excitability of regular-spiking neurons, is important in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Prefrontal theta oscillations promote selective encoding of behaviorally relevant events</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The ability to capture the most relevant information from everyday experiences without constantly learning unimportant details is vital to survival and mental health. While decreased activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is associated with failed or inflexible encoding of relevant events in the hippocampus, mechanisms used by the mPFC to discern behavioral relevance of events are not clear. To address this question, we chemogenetically activated excitatory neurons in the mPFC of male rats and examined its impact on local network activity and differential associative learning dependent on the hippocampus. Rats were exposed to two neutral stimuli in two environments whose contingency with an aversive stimulus changed systematically across days. Over two weeks of differential and reversal learning, theta band activity began to ramp up toward the expected onset of the aversive stimulus, and this ramping activity tracked the subsequent shift of the set (stimulus modality to environment) predictive of the aversive stimulus. With chemogenetic mPFC activation, the ramping activity emerged within a few sessions of differential learning, which paralleled faster learning and stronger correlations between the ramping activity and conditioned responses. Chemogenetic mPFC activity, however, did not affect the adjustment of ramping activity or behavior during reversal learning or set-shifting, suggesting that the faster learning was not due to a general enhancement of attention, sensory, or motor processing. Thus, the dynamics of the mPFC network activation during events provide a relevance-signaling mechanism through which the mPFC exerts executive control over the encoding of those events in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although we now have a fair understanding of memory encoding, the real-time processes through which the brain controls the strength of memory encoding remain mostly unknown. Developing an understanding of these memory regulation processes is important because it informs a new strategy for memory enhancement, which is critically needed for the fast-growing elderly population facing memory handicaps. We discovered that activating one region of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) facilitated rats to form memories of important events without increasing the learning of unimportant details. The memory enhancement was associated with improved responses of mPFC network to the important events. Manipulations of the mPFC, therefore, allow for tapping into intrinsic memory encoding processes to enhance event memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The differences in local translatome across distinct neuron types is mediated by both baseline cellular differences and post-transcriptional mechanisms</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Local translation in neurites is a phenomenon that enhances spatial segregation of proteins and their functions away from the cell body, yet it is unclear how local translation varies across neuronal cell types. Further, it is unclear if differences in local translation across cell types simply reflect differences in transcription or if there is also a cell type specific posttranscriptional regulation of the location and translation of specific mRNAs. Most of the mRNAs discovered as locally translated have been identified from hippocampal neurons because their laminar organization facilitates neurite specific dissection and microscopy methods. Given the diversity of neurons across the brain, studies have not yet analyzed how locally translated mRNAs differ across cell types. Here, we used the SynapTRAP method to harvest two broad cell types in the mouse forebrain: GABAergic neurons and layer 5 projection neurons. While some transcripts overlap, the majority of the local translatome is not shared across these cell types. In addition to differences driven by baseline expression levels, some transcripts also exhibit cell type specific post transcriptional regulation. Finally, we provide evidence that GABAergic neurons specifically localize mRNAs for peptide neurotransmitters, including somatostatin and cortistatin, suggesting localized production of these key signaling molecules in the neurites of GABAergic neurons. Overall, this work suggests that differences in local translation in neurites across neuronal cell types are poised to contribute substantially to the heterogeneity in neuronal phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; All RNAs are generated in the nucleus, but in neurons some of these RNAs are shuttled for local protein production in neurites towards synapses. There are many types of neurons which express different complements of receptors and perform different functions. However, there has not yet been a direct comparison of the ribosome-bound transcripts in neurites across cells. Here, we identify and define differences in ribosome-bound RNAs isolated from neurites of two contrasting types of neurons. Some of these differences are due to the neurons not creating the RNA at baseline and some are differences in RNA localization or ribosome binding in neurites. We also identified RNAs for key neurotransmitter proteins that had not been previously described as produced in neurites, suggesting these may be locally produced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of grey matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (Time 1 and Time 2) in patients with svPPA (n=11) and bvFTD (n=15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (n=7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Semantic memory is the generalizable knowledge of the world around us, including objects, concepts, and words. It is profoundly impaired in a rare form of frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). The specific impairment of concrete concept knowledge in svPPA, compared to abstract concept knowledge, provides important neurolinguistic understanding of how we process word meaning. Yet, almost no studies to date have related longitudinal cognitive changes to progressive neurodegeneration in svPPA. This study is the first to relate progressive atrophy in svPPA to longitudinal semantic changes; we find that progressive grey matter atrophy in right ventral temporal regions is associated with declining production of concrete nouns in svPPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Pain-related fear - Dissociable neural sources of different fear constructs</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on &quot;fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia&quot;, &quot;fear avoidance beliefs&quot; or &quot;pain anxiety&quot;, pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with non-specific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied Multiple Kernel Learning approach allowed generating models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of non-overlapping neural predictors within fear processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Pain-related fear, often assessed through self-reports such as questionnaires, has shown prognostic value and clinical utility for a variety of musculoskeletal pain disorders. However, it remains difficult to determine a common underlying construct of pain-related fear due to several proposed constructs among questionnaires. The current study describes a novel neuroscientific approach using machine learning of neural patterns within the fear circuit of chronic low back pain patients that has the potential to identify neural commonalities or differences among the various constructs. Ultimately, this approach might afford a deeper understanding of the suggested constructs and might be also applied to other domains where ambiguity exists between different psychological constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;BDNF is a critical contributor to neuronal growth, development, learning, and memory. Although extensively studied in the brain, BDNF is also expressed by primary afferent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Unfortunately, anatomical and functional studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF have been limited by the availability of appropriate molecular tools. Here, we used targeted, inducible molecular approaches to characterize the expression pattern of primary afferent BDNF and the extent to which it contributes to a variety of pain and itch behaviors. Using a &lt;i&gt;BDNF-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; reporter mouse, we found that BDNF is expressed primarily by myelinated primary afferents and has limited overlap with the major peptidergic and non-peptidergic subclasses of nociceptors and pruritoceptors. We also observed extensive neuronal, but not glial, expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In addition, because BDNF null mice are not viable and even Cre-mediated deletion of BDNF from sensory neurons could have developmental consequences, here we deleted BDNF selectively from sensory neurons, in the adult, using an advillin-Cre-ER line crossed to floxed BDNF mice. We found that BDNF deletion in the adult altered few itch or acute and chronic pain behaviors, beyond sexually dimorphic phenotypes in the tail immersion, histamine, and formalin tests. Based on the anatomical distribution of sensory neuron-derived BDNF and its limited contribution to pain and itch processing, we suggest that future studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF should examine behaviors evoked by activation of myelinated primary afferents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration is a process transversal to neuropsychiatric diseases and the understanding of its mechanisms should allow devising strategies to prevent this irreversible step in brain diseases. Neurodegeneration caused by seizures is a critical step in the aggravation of temporal lobe epilepsy, but its mechanisms remain undetermined. Convulsions trigger an elevation of extracellular adenosine and upregulate adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R), which have been associated with the control of neurodegenerative diseases. Using the rat and mouse kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we now tested whether A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R control convulsions-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. The pharmacological or genetic blockade of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R did not affect kainate-induced convulsions but dampened the subsequent neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity began with a rapid A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R upregulation within glutamatergic synapses (within 2 h), through local translation of synaptic A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R mRNA. This bolstered A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated facilitation of glutamate release and of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 synapses (4 h), triggered a subsequent synaptotoxicity, heralded by decreased synaptic plasticity and loss of synaptic markers coupled to calpain activation (12 h), that predated overt neuronal loss (24 h). All modifications were prevented by the deletion of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R selectively in forebrain neurons. This shows that synaptic A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R critically control synaptic excitotoxicity, which underlies the development of convulsions-induced neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions in TectaY1870C/+ Mice Reflect Changes in Cochlear Amplification and How It Is Controlled by the Tectorial Membrane</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) recorded from the ear canal in the absence of sound reflect cochlear amplification, an outer hair cell (OHC) process required for the extraordinary sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Although wild-type mice rarely emit, those with mutations that influence the tectorial membrane (TM) show an incidence of SOAEs similar to that in humans. In this report, we characterized mice with a missense mutation in &lt;i&gt;Tecta,&lt;/i&gt; a gene required for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix within the core of the TM. Mice heterozygous for the Y1870C mutation (&lt;i&gt;Tecta&lt;sup&gt;Y1870C/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) are prolific emitters, despite a moderate hearing loss. Additionally, Kimura’s membrane, into which the OHC stereocilia insert, separates from the main body of the TM, except at apical cochlear locations. Multimodal SOAEs are also observed in &lt;i&gt;Tecta&lt;sup&gt;Y1870C/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice where energy is present at frequencies that are integer multiples of a lower-frequency SOAE (the primary). Second-harmonic SOAEs, at twice the frequency of a lower-frequency primary, are the most frequently observed. These secondary SOAEs are found in spatial regions where stimulus-evoked OAEs are small or in the noise floor. Introduction of high-level suppressors just above the primary SOAE frequency reduce or eliminate both primary and second-harmonic SOAEs. In contrast, second-harmonic SOAEs are not affected by suppressors, either above or below the second-harmonic SOAE frequency, even when they are much larger in amplitude. Hence, second-harmonic SOAEs do not appear to be spatially separated from their primaries, a finding that has implications for cochlear mechanics and the consequences of changes to TM structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sampling regulates stimulus intensity and temporal dynamics at the sense organ. Despite variations in sampling behavior, animals must make veridical perceptual judgments about external stimuli. In olfaction, odor sampling varies with respiration, which influences neural responses at the olfactory periphery. Nevertheless, rats were able to perform fine odor intensity judgments despite variations in sniff kinetics. To identify the features of neural activity supporting stable intensity perception, in awake mice we measured responses of mitral/tufted (MT) cells to different odors and concentrations across a range of sniff frequencies. Amplitude and latency of the MT cells’ responses vary with sniff duration. A fluid dynamics (FD) model based on odor concentration kinetics in the intranasal cavity can account for this variability. Eliminating sniff waveform dependence of MT cell responses using the FD model allows for significantly better decoding of concentration. This suggests potential schemes for sniff waveform invariant odor concentration coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain state–dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: (1) the associative group received 30 pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; and (2) in the control group, the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl–Meyer assessment [LE‐FM; primary outcome measure]) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials [MEPs]) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median [interquartile range] LE‐FM improvement = 6.5 [3.5–8.25] and 3 [0.75–3], respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation. Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–12&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Anticipatory adjustments of posture allow elderly fallers to achieve a balance recovery performance equivalent to elderly non-fallers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/506501v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/506501v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: In an important number of laboratory-based perturbation experiments, differences in the balance recovery performance of elderly fallers and non-fallers are moderate or absent. This performance may be affected by the subjects adjusting their initial posture in anticipation of the perturbation. Research questions: Do elderly fallers and non-fallers adjust their posture in anticipation of externally-imposed perturbations in a laboratory setting, and how does this impact their balance recovery performance? Methods: 21 elderly non-fallers, 18 age-matched elderly fallers and 11 young adults performed both a forward waist-pull perturbation task and a Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) task. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded. For each group, we evaluated the balance recovery performance in the perturbation task, change in initial center of mass (CoM) position between the CSRT and the perturbation task, and the influence of initial CoM position on task performance. Results: The balance recovery performance of elderly fallers was equivalent to elderly non-fallers (p &amp;gt; 0.5 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). All subject groups anticipated forward perturbations by shifting their CoM backward compared to the CSRT task (young: 2.1% of lower limb length, elderly non-fallers: 2.7%, elderly fallers: 2.2%, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, p &amp;lt; 0.001 Mann-Whitney U). This backward shift increases the probability of resisting the traction without taking a step. Significance: The ability to anticipate perturbations is preserved in elderly fallers and may explain their preserved balance recovery performance in laboratory-based perturbation tasks. Therefore, future studies aimed at predicting fall risk in elderly adults should carefully control for this postural strategy, by interleaving perturbations of different directions for example.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Anticipatory adjustment of mechanical properties for motor stabilisation</title>

	<description>External perturbation forces may compromise the success in a motor task, such as using a tool or simply standing still. Unexpected perturbations are particularly challenging, because of the delays in the neural feedback control of movement. We present a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays. According to this model, body mechanical properties such as stiffness and inertia play a critical role for maintaining immobility despite external perturbations, since they determine the relative speed at which perturbations are amplified during the neural response delay. Stiffness and inertia may be adjusted through changes in muscle co-contraction and posture. We therefore propose a novel role of feed-forward motor control in providing robustness to perturbations: the anticipatory adjustment of mechanical properties for motor stabilisation. Our model thus predicts that when immobility or accuracy become critical, the nervous system should adjust the body mechanical properties so as to reduce the amplification of perturbations during the response delay, and should additionally reduce neural feedback gains to prevent over-compensation. This model accounts for the strategy that subjects employ when standing in challenging balance conditions and when manipulating unstable tools.</description>

	<description>Following axon pathfinding, growth cones transition from stochastic filopodial exploration to the formation of a limited number of synapses. How the interplay of filopodia and synapse assembly ensures robust connectivity in the brain has remained a challenging problem. Here, we developed a new 4D analysis method for filopodial dynamics and a data-driven computational model of synapse formation for R7 photoreceptor axons in developing Drosophila brains. Our live data support a 'serial synapse formation' model, where at any time point only a single 'synaptogenic' filopodium suppresses the synaptic competence of other filopodia through competition for synaptic seeding factors. Loss of the synaptic seeding factors Syd-1 and Liprin- leads to a loss of this suppression, filopodial destabilization and reduced synapse formation, which is sufficient to cause the destabilization of entire axon terminals. Our model provides a filopodial 'winner-takes-all' mechanism that ensures the formation of an appropriate number of synapses.</description>

	<description>Methods for eliciting epilepsy in animal models induce seizures in large parts of the brain, or damage the brain. We introduce an animal model of somatosensory-evoked reflex-seizures, which generates focal seizures and does not involve damage to the brain. To this end, stimulated electrically a digit or forepaw of adult rats sedated with dexmedetomidine and measured neurophysiological activity from area S1FL using laminar probes. Seizures generated during the stimulation period showed prolonged discharges following the cessation of the stimulus. Stimulation of the forepaw elicited more seizures than stimulation of a digit. The neurophysiological activity during seizures showed higher amplitudes than during normal evoked responses. High-frequency oscillation were observed prior to- and during the seizures, with amplitudes higher than those associated with normal evoked responses. Seizures were typically followed by refractory periods with decreased neuronal activity. Similar seizures were recorded by ECoG arrays placed over the dura matter, indicating that the seizures were not induced by damage caused by the laminar probes. Optical imaging of cerebral blood volume showed that the seizures were initially focal and propagated from the onset zone to a larger territory, during the stimulation and following its cessation. Unlike rats sedated with dexmedetomidine, rats anesthetized with urethane showed no ictal discharges, indicating that the seizures depended on the dexmedetomidine. Our proposed animal model generates seizures evoked by sensory electrical stimulation free of artifacts or brain damage. It can be used for studying the mechanisms of the generation and propagation of reflex seizures, and for evaluating antiepileptic drugs.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/506337v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A theory of cortical function is proposed, based on a family of recurrent neural circuits, called ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted Neural Integrator Circuits). Here, the theory is applied to working memory and motor control. Working memory is a cognitive process for temporarily maintaining and manipulating information. Most empirical neuroscience research on working memory has measured sustained activity during delayed-response tasks, and most models of working memory are designed to explain sustained activity. But this focus on sustained activity (i.e., maintenance) ignores manipulation, and there are a variety of experimental results that are difficult to reconcile with sustained activity. ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of activity, and ORGaNICs can be use to manipulate (as well as maintain) information during a working memory task. The theory provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. When applied to motor systems, ORGaNICs can be used to convert spatial patterns of premotor activity to temporal profiles of motor control activity: different spatial patterns of premotor activity evoke different motor control dynamics. ORGaNICs offer a novel conceptual framework; Rethinking cortical computation in these terms should have widespread implications, motivating a variety of experiments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gpr158 deficiency impacts hippocampal CA1 neuronal excitability, dendritic architecture, and affects spatial learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/506295v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (Gpr158) is highly expressed in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It gained attention as it was implicated in physiological responses to stress and depression. Recently, Gpr158 has been shown to act as a pathway-specific synaptic organizer in the hippocampus, required for proper mossy fiber-CA3 neurocircuitry establishment, structure, and function. Although rodent Gpr158 expression is highest in CA3, considerable expression occurs in CA1 especially after the first postnatal month. Here, we combined hippocampal-dependent behavioral paradigms with subsequent electrophysiological and morphological analyses from the same group of mice to assess the effects of Gpr158 deficiency on CA1 physiology and function. We demonstrate deficits in spatial memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze paradigm, along with deficits in the acquisition of extinction memory in the passive avoidance test in Gpr158 KO mice. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed normal basal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, however, Schaffer collateral stimulation yielded dramatically reduced post-synaptic currents. Interestingly, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidals was found increased, potentially acting as a compensatory mechanism to the reductions in Schaffer collateral-mediated drive. Both ex vivo and in vitro, neurons deficient for Gpr158 exhibited robust reductions in dendritic architecture and complexity, i.e., reduced length, surface, bifurcations, and branching. This effect was localized in the apical but not basal compartment of adult CA1 pyramidals, indicative of pathway-specific alterations. A significant positive correlation between spatial memory acquisition and extent of complexity of CA1 pyramidals was found. Taken together, we provide first evidence of significant disruptions in hippocampal CA1 neuronal dendritic architecture and physiology, driven by Gpr158 deficiency. Importantly, the hippocampal neuronal morphology deficits appear to support the impairments in spatial memory acquisition observed in Gpr158 KO mice.</description>

	<description>Retinal input is frequently lost due to eye blinks, yet humans rarely notice these gaps in visual input. While previous studies focused on the psychophysical and neural correlates of diminished awareness to blinks, the impact of blinks on the perceived time of concurrent events is unknown. Here, we investigated whether the subjective sense of time is altered by spontaneous eye blinks, and how this link may inform mechanisms of time perception. We found that participants significantly underestimated the duration of a visual stimulus when a blink occurred during the stimulus. Importantly, this effect was not present when durations of an auditory stimulus were judged. These results point to a link between spontaneous blinks, previously demonstrated to induce suppression of activity in early visual cortex, and a compression of subjective time. The findings suggest that ongoing encoding within modality-specific sensory cortices, independent of conscious awareness, inform the subjective sense of time.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Measurements of Subthreshold and Fast Population Neuronal Activity with Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicator GCaMP-6f</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/505834v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>GCaMP-6f is among the best calcium indicators and has been widely used for monitoring neuronal activity in the brain. Applications are at cellular level (calcium transients of action potentials) or population activity (fluorimetry) during network events. Two important issues remain less explored: 1) Is GCaMP-6f signal sensitive enough for detecting subthreshold activity, similar to the sensitivity of local field potential (LFP)? 2) Is the GCaMP-6f signal fast enough for detecting network oscillations seen in LFP? Here the two issues are explored in a number of network events including hippocampus sharp waves (SWs), carbachol induced theta oscillations, interictal-like spikes and neuronal response evoked by high frequency stimuli. SWs are a typical network event with the majority of neurons receiving subthreshold excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input without firing action potentials. The excitatory/inhibitory post synaptic potentials (EPSP/IPSP) in the neuropil become detectable in local field potential (LFP) signals. We compare simultaneously recorded LFP and optical recording of GCaMP-6f fluorescent signals in Thy1-GCaMP-6f mice hippocampal slices. We found that the occurrence of SWs produces a clear population GCaMP-6f signal of 0.3% dF/F. This population GCaMP-6f signal correlated well with the LFP, albeit a delay of ~50 ms was observed. The population GCaMP-6f signal follows well with the 20 Hz population activity evoked by electric stimuli, while activity up to 40 Hz was detected with reduced amplitude. GCaMP-6f and LFP signals showed a large amplitude discrepancy. The amplitude of GCaMP increased ~1000 times from SW to carbachol induced theta burst, while the LFP changed less than 10 times. Our results suggested that population GCaMP-6f signals may become a sensitive tool for detecting network activity, especially for that with low LFP amplitude during elevated spiking rate but asynchronized events. GCaMP signal is fast enough for monitoring theta and beta oscillations (&amp;lt;25Hz) in the neuronal population. Faster calcium indicators (e.g., GCaMP-7) may improve the frequency response property for detecting gamma band oscillations. In addition, population GCaMP recordings are non-contact and free from stimulation artifacts. These features may be useful for high throughput recordings and applications sensitive to stimulus artifact, e.g., monitoring response during continuous stimulations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transcriptional activation of DBP by hnRNP K facilitates circadian rhythm.</title>

	<description>D-site albumin promoter binding protein (DBP) supports the rhythmic transcription of downstream genes, in part by displaying high-amplitude cycling of its own transcripts compared to other circadian clock genes. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that poly(C) motif within DBP proximal promoters, in addition to an E-box element, provoked the transcriptional activation through increased RNA polymerase 2 (Pol2) recruitment by inducing higher chromatin accessibility. We also clarified that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is a key regulator that binds to the poly(C) motif on single-stranded DNAs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation further confirmed the expression-dependent and rhythmic binding of hnRNP K which was inhibited through its cytosolic localization mediated by time-dependent ERK activation. Knockdown of hnRNP K triggered low-amplitude mRNA rhythms in DBP and other core clock genes through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, transgenic depletion of a Drosophila homolog of hnRNP K in circadian pacemaker neurons lengthened 24-hour periodicity in free-running locomotor behaviors. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the function of hnRNP K as a transcriptional amplifier of DBP, which acts rhythmically through its intracellular localization by the ERK phosphorylation and as an mRNA stabilizer along with its physiological significance in circadian rhythms of Drosophila.</description>

	<description>The cognitive process of attention can be modulated by the emotional value of the stimulus. In order to understand this association further we require an animal test of value-modulated attention capture evoked by ethologically valid stimuli. In mice, female odour triggers arousal and elicits emotional responses in males. Here, we determined the extent to which objects infused with female odour captured the attention of male mice. Eight animals were tested in six experiments using a modified version of the spontaneous Novel Object Recognition task. Attention was operationalised using differential exploration time of odour-infused objects (O+), identical but odour-neutral objects (O-), and novel objects (X). We found that when single objects were presented, mice spent comparatively more time exploring O+ objects both when they were novel (Experiment 1) and when they were familiar (Experiment 2). When O+ and O- competed with each other for attention, O+ captured attention preferentially. O+ objects captured attention more than O- objects at a novel (Experiment 3) or a familiar (Experiment 4) location; they also captured attention more than novel objects at either a novel (Experiment 5) or a familiar (Experiment 6) location. These results demonstrate that in mice, female odour can in some circumstances capture attention more than object novelty. These results pave the way for using odour to modulate memory in tests of novel object recognition.</description>

	<description>Sleep affects brain activity globally, but many cortical sleep waves are spatially confined. Local rhythms serve cortical area-specific sleep needs and functions, however, mechanisms controlling locality are unclear. We identify the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) as a source for local, sensory-cortex-specific non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) in mouse. Neurons in optogenetically identified sensory TRN sectors showed stronger repetitive burst discharge compared to non-sensory TRN cells due to higher activity of the low-threshold Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.3. Major NREMS rhythms in sensory but not non-sensory cortical areas were regulated in a Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.3-dependent manner. In particular, NREMS in somatosensory cortex was enriched in fast spindles, but switched to delta wave-dominated sleep when Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.3 channels were genetically eliminated or somatosensory TRN cells chemogenetically hyperpolarized. Our data indicate a previously unrecognized heterogeneity in a powerful forebrain oscillator that contributes to sensory-cortex-specific and dually regulated NREMS, enabling local sleep regulation according to use- and experience-dependence.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: ADHD Symptoms are Associated with the Modular Structure of Intrinsic Brain Networks in a Representative Sample of Healthy Adults</title>

	<description>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with significant and often lifelong effects on social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Influential neurocognitive models of ADHD link behavioral symptoms to altered connections between and within functional brain networks. Here, we investigate whether network-based theories of ADHD can be generalized to understanding variations in ADHD-related behaviors within the normal (i.e., clinically unaffected) adult population. In a large and representative sample, self-rated presence of ADHD symptoms varied widely; only eight out of 291 participants scored in the clinical range. Subject-specific brain-network graphs were modeled from functional MRI resting-state data and revealed significant associations between (non-clinical) ADHD symptoms and region-specific profiles of between-module and within-module connectivity. Effects were located in brain regions associated with multiple neuronal systems including the default-mode network, the salience network, and the central executive system. Our results are consistent with network perspectives of ADHD and provide further evidence for the relevance of an appropriate information transfer between task-negative (default-mode) and task-positive brain regions. More generally, our findings support a dimensional conceptualization of ADHD and contribute to a growing understanding of cognition as an emerging property of functional brain networks.</description>

	<description>In an ever-changing environment, survival depends on learning which stimuli represent threat, and also 3 on updating such associations when circumstances shift. Humans can acquire physiological responses to threat-associated stimuli even when they are unaware of them, but the role of awareness in updating threat contingencies remains unknown. This complex process - generating novel responses while simultaneously suppressing learned ones - relies on distinct neural mechanisms from initial learning, and has only been shown with awareness. Can it occur unconsciously? Here we show that it can. Participants underwent classical threat conditioning to visual stimuli that were suppressed from their awareness. One of two images was paired with an electric shock; halfway through the experiment, contingencies were reversed and the shock was paired with the other image. We found that physiological responses reflected changes in stimulus-threat pairings independently of stimulus awareness, demonstrating the sophistication of unconscious affective flexibility.</description>

	<description>A central principle in motor control is that the coordination strategies learned by our nervous system are often optimal. Here we combined human experiments with computational reinforcement learning models to study how the nervous system navigates possible movements to arrive at an optimal coordination. Our experiments used robotic exoskeletons to reshape the relationship between how participants walk and how much energy they consume. We found that while some participants used their relatively high natural gait variability to explore the new energetic landscape and spontaneously initiate energy optimization, most participants preferred to exploit their originally preferred, but now suboptimal, gait. We could nevertheless reliably initiate optimization in these exploiters by providing them with the experience of lower cost gaits suggesting that the nervous system benefits from cues about the relevant dimensions along which to re-optimize its coordination. Once optimization was initiated, we found that the nervous system employed a local search process to converge on the new optimum gait over tens of seconds. Once optimization was completed, the nervous system learned to predict this new optimal gait and rapidly returned to it within a few steps if perturbed away. We model this optimization process as reinforcement learning and find behavior that closely matches these experimental observations. We conclude that the nervous system optimizes for energy using a prediction of the optimal gait, and then refines this prediction with the cost of each new walking step.</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a 6‐month clinical study with 3 transradial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–18&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks in the brain consist of different types of neurons. We here
investigate the influence of neuron diversity on the dynamical stability, phase
space structure, and computational capabilities of inhibitory spiking networks
using mixtures of neurons with positive and negative dissipation. We find that
already a single neuron of a different type may qualitatively change the
dynamics of a neural network and that mixed networks can combine the
computational capabilities of ones with only a single neuron type. Our networks
contain leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (positive dissipation) as well as
neurons with inverted sign of the leak current (negative dissipation). We first
show that such networks can exhibit a balanced state of irregular, asynchronous
spiking activity, if the neurons with negative dissipation are endowed with a
voltage-dependent input cutoff, which may be interpreted as a simple
conductance-based implementation of their synapses. We compute the voltage
probability distributions and self-consistent firing rates for both types of
neurons for finite size spike impacts assuming that inputs are Poissonian. The
balanced state exists in a variety of neural network models and its dynamical
properties such as chaoticity vary considerably. Our models generalize networks
of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons where the dynamics are non-chaotic despite
their irregularity. We show that switching the sign of the dissipation of a
single neuron renders the entire network dynamics unstable and chaotic as
indicated by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent. To further characterize the
dynamics we consider the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and the related
covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), which indicate the directions in which
infinitesimal perturbations grow or shrink with a rate given by the Lyapunov
exponents. We find that for each ...

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this overview, we discuss the connections between the observations of
critical dynamics in neuronal networks and the maximum entropy models that are
often used as statistical models of neural activity, focusing in particular on
the relation between &quot;statistical&quot; and &quot;dynamical&quot; criticality. We present
examples of systems that are critical in one way, but not in the other,
exemplifying thus the difference of the two concepts. We then discuss the
emergence of Zipf laws in neural activity, verifying their presence in retinal
activity under a number of different conditions. In the second part of the
chapter we review connections between statistical criticality and the structure
of the parameter space, as described by Fisher information. We note that the
model-based signature of criticality, namely the divergence of specific heat,
emerges independently of the dataset studied; we suggest this is compatible
with previous theoretical findings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study an abstracted model of neuronal activity via numerical simulation,
and report spatiotemporal pattern formation and critical like dynamics. A
population of pulse coupled, discretised, relaxation oscillators is simulated
over networks with varying edge density and spatial embedded ness. For
intermediate edge density and sufficiently strong spatial embeddedness, we
observe a novel spatiotemporal pattern in the field of oscillator phases,
visually resembling the surface of a frothing liquid. Increasing the edge
density results in critical dynamics, with the distribution of neuronal
avalanche sizes following a power law with exponent one. Further increase of
the edge density results in metastable behaviour between pattern formation and
synchronisation, before transitioning the system entirely into synchrony.

	<description>The protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is tightly regulated by a network of signaling pathways, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR sensors monitor the ER folding status to adjust ER folding capacity according to need. To understand how the UPR sensor IRE1 maintains ER homeostasis, we identified zero-length crosslinks of RNA to IRE1 with single nucleotide precision&lt;i&gt; in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that IRE1 specifically crosslinks to a subset of ER-targeted mRNAs, SRP RNA, ribosomal and transfer RNAs. Crosslink sites cluster in a discrete region of the ribosome surface spanning from the A-site to the polypeptide exit tunnel. Moreover, IRE1 binds to purified 80S ribosomes with high affinity, indicating association with ER-bound ribosomes. Our results suggest that the ER protein translocation and targeting machineries work together with the UPR to tune the ER's protein folding load.</description>

	<description>Bacteria communicate and collectively regulate gene expression using a process called quorum sensing (QS). QS relies on group-wide responses to signal molecules called autoinducers. Here, we show that QS activates a new program of multicellularity in &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. This program, which we term aggregation, is distinct from the canonical surface-biofilm formation program, which QS represses. Aggregation is induced by autoinducers, occurs rapidly in cell suspensions, and does not require cell-division, features strikingly dissimilar from those characteristic of &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation. Extracellular DNA limits aggregate size, but is not sufficient to drive aggregation. A mutagenesis screen identifies genes required for aggregate formation, revealing proteins involved in &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; intestinal colonization, stress response, and a protein that distinguishes the current &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; pandemic strain from earlier pandemic strains. We suggest that QS-controlled aggregate formation is important for &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; to successfully transit between the marine niche and the human host.</description>

	<description>Assembly of bacterial ring-shaped hexameric replicative helicases on single-stranded (ss) DNA requires specialized loading factors. However, mechanisms implemented by these factors during opening and closing of the helicase, which enable and restrict access to an internal chamber, are not known. Here, we investigate these mechanisms in the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; DnaB helicase•bacteriophage λ helicase loader (λP) complex. We show that five copies of λP bind at DnaB subunit interfaces and reconfigure the helicase into an open spiral conformation that is intermediate to previously observed closed ring and closed spiral forms; reconfiguration also produces openings large enough to admit ssDNA into the inner chamber. The helicase is also observed in a restrained inactive configuration that poises it to close on activating signal, and transition to the translocation state. Our findings provide insights into helicase opening, delivery to the origin and ssDNA entry, and closing in preparation for translocation.</description>

	<description>Background: Fatigue and depression are frequent and often co-occurring symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) represents a promising tool for disentangling differential associations between depression and fatigue and brain network function and connectivity. In this study we tested for associations between symptoms of fatigue and depression and DMN connectivity in patients with MS. Materials and methods: Seventy-four MS patients were included on average 14 months after diagnosis. They underwent MRI scanning of the brain including rs-fMRI, and symptoms of fatigue and depression were assessed with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). A principal component analysis (PCA) on FSS and BDI scores was performed, and the component scores were analysed using linear regression models to test for associations with default mode network (DMN) connectivity. Results: We observed higher DMN connectivity with higher scores on the primary principal component reflecting common symptom burden for fatigue and depression (Cohen's f2=0.075, t=2.17, p=0.03). The secondary principal component reflecting a pattern of low fatigue scores with high scores of depression was associated with lower DMN connectivity (Cohen's f2=0.067, t=-2.1, p=0.04). Using continuous mean scores of FSS we also observed higher DMN connectivity with higher symptom burden (t=3.1, p=0.003), but no significant associations between continuous sum scores of BDI and DMN connectivity (t=0.8, p=0.4). Conclusion: Multivariate decomposition of FSS and BDI data supported both overlapping and unique manifestation of fatigue and depression in MS patients. Rs-fMRI analyses showed that symptoms of fatigue and depression was reflected in altered DMN connectivity, and that higher DMN activity was seen in MS patients with fatigue even with low depression scores.</description>

	<description>Although neural responses with a millisecond precision were reported in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex of multiple species, the presence and role of such a fine temporal structure is still debated at the cortical level and the general belief remains that early visual system encodes information at slower timescales. In this study, we used a new stimulation platform to generate visual stimuli that were very precisely encoded in time and we characterized in human subjects the EEG responses to moving patterns that shared the same global motion but differed in their fine scale spatio-temporal properties. In two experiments, we manipulated the information within temporal windows that corresponded to the frame duration in conventional (1/60 = 16.7ms, experience 1) and more recent (1/120 = 8.3ms, experience 2) visual displays. Our results demonstrate that EEG responses to temporally dense and coherent trajectories are significantly stronger than those to control conditions without these properties. They extend previous results from our group that showed that accurate temporal information (&amp;lt;10ms) significantly improve perceptual judgments on spatial discrimination, digit recognition and sensitivity for speed [Kime et al., 2016]. Altogether, our results suggest that instead of low-pass filtering the temporal information it receives from its thalamic afferents, the visual cortex may actually exploit its richness to improve visual perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prior Perceptual-Cognitive Training Builds Mental Resistance During Acute Physical Fatigue In Professional Rugby Athletes</title>

	<description>Elite athletes are engaged in intensive physical training programs because it improves their physical strength and agility, but also to build endurance for resisting the negative impact of fatigue. Although it is well accepted that physical fitness can reduce the consequence of mental fatigue it is still unknown whether specific mental training can reduce the negative impact of physical fatigue on perceptual-cognitive functions. Here we show in professional rugby players that acute physical fatigue can dramatically reduce mental performance required for processing 3D-Multiple Object Tracking (3D-MOT) and that prior training, void of any physical demands, can build resistance to these detrimental effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optimizing optogenetic stimulation protocols in auditory corticofugal neurons based on closed-loop spike feedback</title>

	<description>Optogenetics provides a means to probe functional connections between brain areas. By activating a set of presynaptic neurons and recording the activity from a downstream brain area, one can establish the sign and strength of a feedforward connection. One challenge is that there are virtually limitless patterns that can be used to stimulate a presynaptic brain area. Functional influences on downstream brain areas can depend not just on whether presynaptic neurons were activated, but how they were activated. Corticofugal axons from the auditory cortex (ACtx) heavily innervate the auditory tectum, the inferior colliculus (IC). Despite the anatomical weight of this connection, optogenetic activation of ACtx neurons produced only modest changes in the IC neuron firing rates. To determine whether different modes of cortical activation could more faithfully reveal the strength of feedforward connectivity, we employed a closed-loop evolutionary optimization procedure that tailored voltage command signals to the laser based on firing rate variations recorded from single units in the IC of awake male and female mice. Within minutes, the evolutionary search procedure converged on ACtx stimulation configurations that produced more effective and widespread enhancement of IC unit activity than generic activation parameters. Cortical modulation of midbrain spiking was bi-directional, as the evolutionary search procedure could be programmed to converge on activation patterns that suppressed or enhanced sound-evoked IC firing rate. These findings demonstrate that the feedforward influence between brain areas can vary both in sign and degree depending on how presynaptic neurons are activated in time.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Direct Evidence for Prediction Signals in Frontal Cortex Independent of Prediction Error</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction error (PE) signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from PE signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for PC in the form of PE signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here, we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex evinces prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The broadband high-frequency amplitude (HFA) was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single-trial HFA predicted deviations and correlated with poststimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of PE signals.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Acquisition of Spatial Search Strategies and Reversal Learning in the Morris Water Maze Depend on Disparate Brain Functional Connectivity in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Learning has been proposed to coincide with changes in connections between brain regions. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) to map brain-wide functional connectivity (FC) in mice that were trained in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze. C57BL6 mice were investigated in a small animal MRI scanner following 2, 10, or 15 days of acquisition learning, or 5 days of reversal learning. Spatial learning coincided with progressive and changing FC between telencephalic regions that have been implemented in spatial learning (such as hippocampus, cingulate, visual, and motor cortex). Search strategy assessment demonstrated that the use of cognitively advanced spatial strategies correlated positively with extensive telencephalic connectivity, whereas non-spatial strategies correlated negatively with connectivity. FC patterns were different and more extensive after reversal learning compared with after extended acquisition learning, which could explain why reversal learning has been shown to be more sensitive to subtle functional defects.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ceftriaxone Treatment Preserves Cortical Inhibitory Interneuron Function via Transient Salvage of GLT-1 in a Rat Traumatic Brain Injury Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy328</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a decrease in glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) expression, the major mechanism for glutamate removal from synapses. Coupled with an increase in glutamate release from dead and dying neurons, this causes an increase in extracellular glutamate. The ensuing glutamate excitotoxicity disproportionately damages vulnerable GABAergic parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons, resulting in a progressively worsening cortical excitatory:inhibitory imbalance due to a loss of GABAergic inhibitory tone, as evidenced by chronic post-traumatic symptoms such as epilepsy, and supported by neuropathologic findings. This loss of intracortical inhibition can be measured and followed noninvasively using long-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with mechanomyography (LI-ppTMS-MMG). Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic, is a potent stimulator of the expression of rodent GLT-1 and would presumably decrease excitotoxic damage to GABAergic interneurons. It may thus be a viable antiepileptogenic intervention. Using a rat fluid percussion injury TBI model, we utilized LI-ppTMS-MMG, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry to test whether ceftriaxone treatment preserves intracortical inhibition and cortical parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneuron function after TBI in rat motor cortex. We show that neocortical GLT-1 gene and protein expression are significantly reduced 1 week after TBI, and this transient loss is mitigated by ceftriaxone. Importantly, whereas intracortical inhibition declines progressively after TBI, 1 week of post-TBI ceftriaxone treatment attenuates the loss of inhibition compared to saline-treated controls. This finding is accompanied by significantly higher parvalbumin gene and protein expression in ceftriaxone-treated injured rats. Our results highlight prospects for ceftriaxone as an intervention after TBI to prevent cortical inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, partly by preserving GLT-1 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Representations of Perceived and Retrieved Visual Information in Hippocampus and Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory retrieval is thought to depend on interactions between hippocampus and cortex, but the nature of representation in these regions and their relationship remains unclear. Here, we performed an ultra-high field fMRI (7T) experiment, comprising perception, learning and retrieval sessions. We observed a fundamental difference between representations in hippocampus and high-level visual cortex during perception and retrieval. First, while object-selective posterior fusiform cortex showed consistent responses that allowed us to decode object identity across both perception and retrieval one day after learning, object decoding in hippocampus was much stronger during retrieval than perception. Second, in visual cortex but not hippocampus, there was consistency in response patterns between perception and retrieval, suggesting that substantial neural populations are shared for both perception and retrieval. Finally, the decoding in hippocampus during retrieval was not observed when retrieval was tested on the same day as learning suggesting that the retrieval process itself is not sufficient to elicit decodable object representations. Collectively, these findings suggest that while cortical representations are stable between perception and retrieval, hippocampal representations are much stronger during retrieval, implying some form of reorganization of the representations between perception and retrieval.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Aging-Related Changes in Cognition and Cortical Integrity are Associated With Serum Expression of Candidate MicroRNAs for Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy323</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in molecular pathways responsible for aging and prevalent aging-related chronic diseases. However, the lack of research linking circulating levels of miRNAs to changes in the aging brain hampers clinical translation. Here, we have investigated if serum expression of brain-enriched miRNAs that have been proposed as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a) are also associated with cognitive functioning and changes of the cerebral cortex in normal elderly subjects. Results revealed that candidate miRNAs were linked to changes in cortical thickness (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, and miR-125b), cortical glucose metabolism (miR-29b, miR-125b, and miR-146a), and cognitive performance (miR-9, miR-34a, and miR-125b). While both miR-29b and miR-125b were related to aging-related structural and metabolic cortical changes, only expression levels of miR-125b were associated with patterns of glucose consumption shown by cortical regions that correlated with executive function. Together, these findings suggest that serum expression of AD-related miRNAs are biologically meaningful in aging and may play a role as biomarkers of cerebral vulnerability in late life.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: EphA4 Regulates Hippocampal Neural Precursor Proliferation in the Adult Mouse Brain by d-Serine Modulation of N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy319</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy319/5257446?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a major region of the adult rodent brain in which neurogenesis occurs throughout life. The EphA4 receptor, which regulates neurogenesis and boundary formation in the developing brain, is also expressed in the adult DG, but whether it regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not known. Here, we show that, in the adult mouse brain, EphA4 inhibits hippocampal precursor cell proliferation but does not affect precursor differentiation or survival. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 significantly increased hippocampal precursor proliferation &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt;, by blocking EphA4 forward signaling. EphA4 was expressed by mature hippocampal DG neurons but not neural precursor cells, and an EphA4 antagonist, EphA4-Fc, did not activate clonal cultures of precursors until they were co-cultured with non-precursor cells, indicating an indirect effect of EphA4 on the regulation of precursor activity. Supplementation with &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine blocked the increased precursor proliferation induced by EphA4 inhibition, whereas blocking the interaction between &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) promoted precursor activity, even at the clonal level. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EphA4 indirectly regulates adult hippocampal precursor proliferation and thus plays a role in neurogenesis via &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine-regulated NMDAR signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metacognition, the ability to know about one’s thought process, is self-referential. Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations (β; 15–40 Hz) with increases in early β power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of β power in a low-dimensional space (β state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that β states instantiate an internal variable determining the fate of the timing network’s trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing, suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Unilateral dorsal column lesions (DCL) at the cervical spinal cord deprive the hand regions of somatosensory cortex of tactile activation. However, considerable cortical reactivation occurs over weeks to months of recovery. While most studies focused on the reactivation of primary somatosensory area 3b, here, for the first time, we address how the higher-order somatosensory cortex reactivates in the same monkeys after DCL that vary across cases in completeness, post-lesion recovery times, and types of treatments. We recorded neural responses to tactile stimulation in areas 3a, 3b, 1, secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and occasionally areas 2/5. Our analysis emphasized comparisons of the responsiveness, somatotopy, and receptive field size between areas 3b, 1, and S2/PV across DCL conditions and recovery times. The results indicate that the extents of the reactivation in higher-order somatosensory areas 1 and S2/PV closely reflect the reactivation in primary somatosensory cortex. Responses in higher-order areas S2 and PV can be stronger than those in area 3b, thus suggesting converging or alternative sources of inputs. The results also provide evidence that both primary and higher-order fields are effectively activated after long recovery times as well as after behavioral and electrocutaneous stimulation interventions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Chandelier cells (ChCs, also known as axo-axonic cells) are a distinct GABAergic interneuron subtype that exclusively target the axonal initial segment, which is the site of pyramidal neuron action potential initiation. ChCs are a source of ErbB4 expression and alterations in ChC-pyramidal neuron connectivity occur in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of schizophrenic patients and animal models of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of ErbB4 in mPFC ChCs to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remains unknown. By conditional deletion or knockdown of ErbB4 from mPFC ChCs, we demonstrated that ErbB4 deficits led to impaired ChC-pyramidal neuron connections and cognitive dysfunctions. Furthermore, the cognitive dysfunctions were normalized by L-838417, an agonist of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;α2 receptors enriched in the axonal initial segment. Given that cognitive dysfunctions are a core symptom of schizophrenia, our results may provide a new perspective for understanding the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;α2 receptors may be potential pharmacological targets for its treatment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;WD repeat protein 1 (Wdr1), known as a cofactor of actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, is conserved among eukaryotes, and it plays a critical role in the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the function of Wdr1 in the central nervous system remains elusive. Using &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; conditional knockout mice, we demonstrated that Wdr1 plays a significant role in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory. The knockout mice exhibited altered reversal spatial learning and fear responses. Moreover, the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; CKO mice showed significant abnormalities in spine morphology and synaptic function, including enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation and impaired long-term depression. Furthermore, we observed that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; deficiency perturbed actin rearrangement through regulation of the ADF/cofilin activity. Taken together, these results indicate that Wdr1 in the hippocampal CA1 area plays a critical role in actin dynamics in associative learning and postsynaptic receptor availability.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The FXR2P low complexity domain drives assembly of multiple fibril types with differing ribosome association in neurons</title>

	<description>RNA binding proteins (RBPs) typically function in higher order assemblages to regulate RNA localization and translation. The Fragile X homolog FXR2P is an RBP essential for formation of Fragile X granules, which associate with axonal mRNA and ribosomes in the intact brain. Here we performed an unbiased EGFP insertional mutagenesis screen to probe for FXR2P domains important for assembly into higher order structural states in neurons. Fifteen of the 18 unique in-frame FXR2PEGFP fusions tested formed cytosolic granules. However, EGFP insertion within a 23 amino acid region of the low complexity (LC) domain induced formation of distinct FXR2PEGFP fibrils (A and B) that were found in isolation or assembled into highly ordered bundles. Type A and B complexes exhibited different developmental timelines, ultrastructure and ribosome association with ribosomes absent from bundled Type B fibrils. The formation of both fibril types was dependent on an intact RNA binding domain. We conclude that formation of these higher order FXR2P assemblages with alternative structural and compositional states in neurons requires collaboration between the LC and RNA binding domains.</description>

	<description>We investigated motor skill learning using a path tracking task, where human subjects had to track various curved paths at a constant speed while maintaining the cursor within the path width. Subjects' accuracy increased with practice, even when tracking novel untrained paths. Using a &quot;searchlight&quot; paradigm, where only a short segment of the path ahead of the cursor was shown, we found that subjects with a higher tracking skill took a longer section of the future path into account when performing the task. An optimal control model with a fixed horizon (receding horizon control) that increases with tracking skill quantitatively captured the subjects' movement behaviour. These findings demonstrate that human subjects increase their planning horizon when acquiring a motor skill.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Experimental colitis drives enteric alpha-synuclein accumulation and Parkinson-like brain pathology</title>

	<description>Intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is key in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Published studies suggest that this process begins in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and propagates into the brain decades before clinical diagnosis of PD. The triggers and mechanisms underlying the accumulation of aSyn remain unknown but evidence is growing, that immune pathways and in particular colitis may play a critical role. Here we demonstrate that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit aSyn accumulation in their colon. We then confirmed in an experimental model of IBD that intestinal inflammation can trigger aSyn accumulation in the ENS of wildtype and aSyn transgenic mice. We discovered that the type and degree of inflammation modulates the extent of aSyn accumulation in the colon and that macrophage-related signaling limits this process. Remarkably, experimental colitis at three months of age exacerbated the accumulation of aggregated phospho-Serine 129 aSyn in the midbrain, including the substantia nigra, in 21-month but not 9-month-old aSyn transgenic mice. This was accompanied by loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons, another neuropathological hallmark of PD. Together, our data suggest a critical role for intestinal inflammation in the initiation and progression of PD.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Menthol stereoisomers exhibit different effects on {alpha}4{beta}2 nAChR upregulation and dopamine neuron spontaneous firing</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Menthol contributes to poor cessation rates among smokers, in part because menthol enhances nicotine reward and reinforcement. Mentholated tobacco products contain (–)-menthol and (+)-menthol, in varying proportions. We examined these two menthol stereoisomers for their ability to upregulate α4β2 nAChRs and to alter dopamine neuron firing frequency using long-term, low-dose (≤ 500 nM) exposure that is pharmacologically relevant to smoking. We found that (–)-menthol upregulates α4β2 nAChRs while (+)-menthol does not. We also found that (–)-menthol decreases dopamine neuron baseline firing and dopamine neuron excitability, while (+)-menthol exhibits no effect. We then examined both stereoisomers for their ability to inhibit α4β2 nAChR function at higher concentrations (&amp;gt;10 µM) using the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocyte expression system. To probe for the potential binding site of menthol, we conducted flooding simulations and site-directed mutagenesis. We found that menthol likely binds to the 9’ position on the TM2 helix. We found that menthol inhibition is dependent on the end-to-end distance of the side chain at the 9’ residue. Additionally, we have found that (–)-menthol is only modestly (~25%) more potent than (+)-menthol at inhibiting wildtype α4β2 nAChRs and a series of L9’ mutant nAChRs. These data reveal that menthol exhibits a stereoselective effect on nAChRs and that the stereochemical effect is much greater for long-term, sub µM exposure in mice than for acute, higher level exposure. We hypothesize that of the two menthol stereoisomers, only (–)-menthol plays a role in enhancing nicotine reward through nAChRs on dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Menthol is the most popular flavor used in all forms of tobacco products. Depending on the method used to produce the menthol, these products contain two stereoisomers ((–)-menthol and (+)-menthol) in unregulated and poorly characterized amounts. We studied how these isomers of menthol differ in their ability to alter nicotinic receptors on dopamine neurons that contribute to tobacco addiction. Long-term treatment with (–)-menthol and (+)-menthol resulted in a stereospecific effect on nicotinic receptor upregulation and dopamine neuron excitability: (+)-menthol exhibited no effect while (–)-menthol exhibited a robust effect. In acute treatments, we found only slight differences between effects of the two isomers on nicotine receptors. This suggests that long-term exposure to (–)-menthol may contribute to exacerbating tobacco addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Multimodal Characterization of Neural Networks using Highly Transparent Electrode Arrays</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is utilized to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP) and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Electrophysiological recordings, with varying degrees of invasiveness, are the traditional method for measuring neural activity, possessing the capability to measure both individual neurons and populations of neurons. Imaging methods, such as computed tomography scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging, have been developed to accomplish less invasive characterization of neuronal activity; traditionally offering good spatial or relatively high temporal resolution, yet resolution of individual neurons cannot be achieved. Two-photon imaging enables network-wide analysis with cellular resolution on a faster timescale with high spatial fidelity. This study presents a method for the combination of two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings with highly transparent arrays of organic electrodes, presenting a powerful tool to simultaneously acquire the electrical and optical activity of neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lie outside the thalamus. Ann Neurol 2018;84:926–930&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n = 5) or without rituximab (n = 2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1 or 2 doses of tocilizumab in 6 patients with a median interval of 3 days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, 2 patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE. Ann Neurol 2018;84:940–945&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25372?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using 2‐way analysis of variance with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in milliseconds, VS: 152.7 ± 7.9 vs M: 145.3 ± 9.8 vs C: 145.5 ± 9.4; &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 3.28; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and reduced N75–P100 amplitudes (in microvolts, VS: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs M: 12.5 ± 4.7 vs C: 10.8 ± 3.4; &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 3.16; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.051). Dunnett post hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex. Ann Neurol 2018;84:946–949&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25370?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25370?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a neural and renal disorder, characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and early onset nephrotic syndrome. Biallelic mutations in &lt;i&gt;WDR73&lt;/i&gt; and the 4 subunit genes of the KEOPS complex are reported to cause GAMOS. Furthermore, an identical homozygous &lt;i&gt;NUP107&lt;/i&gt; (nucleoporin 107kDa) mutation was identified in 4 GAMOS‐like families, although biallelic &lt;i&gt;NUP107&lt;/i&gt; mutations were originally identified in steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome. NUP107 and NUP133 (nucleoporin 133kDa) are interacting subunits of the nuclear pore complex in the nuclear envelope during interphase, and these proteins are also involved in centrosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in a previously reported GAMOS family with brain atrophy and steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a homozygous &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mutation, c.3335‐11T&amp;gt;A, which results in the insertion of 9bp of intronic sequence between exons 25 and 26 in the mutant transcript. NUP133 and NUP107 interaction was impaired by the &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mutation based on an immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia type IIa was recognized in the brain of an autopsied patient and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed in the kidneys of the 3 examined patients. A &lt;i&gt;nup133&lt;/i&gt;‐knockdown zebrafish model exhibited microcephaly, fewer neuronal cells, underdeveloped glomeruli, and fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes, which mimicked human GAMOS features. &lt;i&gt;nup133&lt;/i&gt; morphants could be rescued by human wild‐type &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mRNA but not by mutant mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that the biallelic &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; loss‐of‐function mutation causes GAMOS. Ann Neurol 2018;84:814–828&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We conducted a European‐only and transancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt; (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 2.2E‐8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.07) and variants in an intron of &lt;i&gt;COL4A1&lt;/i&gt; (rs9521634; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8E‐8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06) and near &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; (rs720470; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.1E‐9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.07) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A professional violinist reported increasing difficulties playing the violin. He executed the initial half of the musical piece well, but produced an increasing number of mistakes during the second half. Neurological examination was remarkable for bradykinesia and tremor. Formal acoustic analysis of finger taps and pronation‐supination showed a decrement in sound intensity and number of taps over time. Oscillations in performance correlated with a parkinsonian tremor. We interpret these findings as the audible equivalent of bradykinesia and tremor. Listening to bradykinesia and quantifying its decrement using acoustic analysis may offer a simple, objective, and reliable supplement to the neurological examination.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. We validated the role of &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &amp;gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &amp;gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &amp;gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. Ann Neurol 2018;84:843–853&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026, η&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.030, η&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.614, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.023, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.030, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical gray matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration, and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology at early stages of MS to better predict long‐term outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n = 12, median disease duration = 2 years), progressive MS (n = 21, disease duration = 25 years), non‐diseased controls (n = 11), and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n = 6) were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range = 1–48% of total cortical GM), and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microglia/macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions, and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‐like structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/macrophage activation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‐like structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss, and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome. Ann Neurol 2018;84:829–842&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson disease. Pathogenic mechanisms include phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, nonphysiological levodopa‐to‐dopamine conversion in serotonergic neurons, hyperactivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, and overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine‐releasing axons. Delay in initiating levodopa is no longer recommended, as dyskinesia development is a function of disease duration rather than cumulative levodopa exposure. We review current and in‐development treatments for peak‐dose dyskinesia but suggest that improvements in levodopa delivery alone may reduce its future prevalence.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cilostazol decreases duration of spreading depolarization and spreading ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25361?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25361?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, angiographic vasospasm (aVS) has been thought to cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, successful treatment of aVS alone does not result in improved neurological outcome. Therefore, there may be other potential causes of poor neurological outcome, including spreading depolarization (SD). A recent study showed beneficial effects of cilostazol on DCI and neurological outcome. The present prospective clinical trial and experimental study focused on effects of cilostazol on SDs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty aSAH patients were treated with clip ligation and randomly assigned to a cilostazol (n = 23) or control group (n = 27). Effects of cilostazol on DCI, aVS, and SDs, measured with subdural electrodes, were examined. The effect of cilostazol on SD‐induced perfusion deficits (spreading ischemia) was assessed in an aSAH‐mimicking model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a trend for less DCI in the cilostazol group, but it did not reach our threshold for statistical significance (13.0% vs 40.0%, odds ratio = 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.059–1.192, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.084). However, the total SD‐induced depression duration per recording day (22.2 vs 30.2 minutes, β = −251.905, 95% CI = −488.458 to −15.356, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.043) and the occurrence of isoelectric SDs (0 vs 4 patients, β = −0.916, 95% CI = −1.746 to −0.085, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.037) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. In rats, cilostazol significantly shortened SD‐induced spreading ischemia compared to vehicle (Student &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; test, difference = 30.2, 95% CI = 5.3–55.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.020).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repair of the neurovascular response to SDs by cilostazol, as demonstrated in the aSAH‐mimicking model, may be a promising therapy to control DCI. Ann Neurol 2018;84:873–885&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia in Parkinson disease: Sleep matters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25360?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of clinical symptom changes during the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa therapy, while offering remarkable control of classical motor symptoms, causes abnormal involuntary movements as the disease progresses. This levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity. Because slow wave activity (SWA) of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep underlies adjustment of cortical excitability, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this physiological process and LID.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients at different stages of PD underwent whole‐night video polysomnography–high‐density electroencephalography (vPSG‐hdEEG), preceded by 1 week of actigraphy. To represent the broad spectrum of the disease, patients were divided into 3 groups by disease stage—(1) de novo (n = 9), (2) advanced (n = 13), and (3) dyskinetic (DYS; n = 14)—were compared to an age‐matched control group (n = 12). The SWA‐NREM content of the vPSG‐hdEEG was then temporally divided into 10 equal parts, from T1 to T10, and power and source analyses were performed. T2‐T3‐T4 were considered early sleep and were compared to T7‐T8‐T9, representing late sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that all groups, except the DYS group, manifested a clear‐cut SWA decrease between early and late sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrate a strong pathophysiological association between sleep and PD. Given that SWA may be a surrogate for synaptic strength, our data suggest that DYS patients do not have adequate synaptic downscaling. Further analysis is needed to determine the effect of drugs that can enhance cortical SWA in LID. Ann Neurol 2018;84:905–917&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Soft Realization: a Bio-inspired Implementation Paradigm. (arXiv:1812.08430v1 [cs.ET])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08430</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers traditionally solve the computational problems through rigorous
and deterministic algorithms called as Hard Computing. These precise algorithms
have widely been realized using digital technology as an inherently reliable
and accurate implementation platform, either in hardware or software forms.
This rigid form of implementation which we refer as Hard Realization relies on
strict algorithmic accuracy constraints dictated to digital design engineers.
Hard realization admits paying as much as necessary implementation costs to
preserve computation precision and determinism throughout all the design and
implementation steps. Despite its prior accomplishments, this conventional
paradigm has encountered serious challenges with today's emerging applications
and implementation technologies. Unlike traditional hard computing, the
emerging soft and bio-inspired algorithms do not rely on fully precise and
deterministic computation. Moreover, the incoming nanotechnologies face
increasing reliability issues that prevent them from being efficiently
exploited in hard realization of applications. This article examines Soft
Realization, a novel bio-inspired approach to design and implementation of an
important category of applications noticing the internal brain structure. The
proposed paradigm mitigates major weaknesses of hard realization by (1)
alleviating incompatibilities with today's soft and bio-inspired algorithms
such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and human sense signal
processing applications, and (2) resolving the destructive inconsistency with
unreliable nanotechnologies. Our experimental results on a set of well-known
soft applications implemented using the proposed soft realization paradigm in
both reliable and unreliable technologies indicate that significant energy,
delay, and area savings can be obtained compared to the conventional
implementation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A multiple attribute model resolves a conflict between additive and multiplicative models of incentive salience. (arXiv:1812.08308v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08308</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08308</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A model of incentive salience as a function of stimulus value and
interoceptive state has been previously proposed. In that model, the function
differs depending on whether the stimulus is appetitive or aversive; it is
multiplicative for appetitive stimuli and additive for aversive stimuli. The
authors argued it was necessary to capture data on how extreme changes in salt
appetite could move evaluation of an extreme salt solution from negative to
positive. We demonstrate that arbitrarily varying this function is unnecessary,
and that a multiplicative function is sufficient if one assumes the incentive
salience function for an incentive (such as salt) is comprised of multiple
stimulus features and multiple interoceptive signals. We show that it is also
unnecessary considering the dual-structure approach-aversive nature of the
reward system, which results in separate weighting of appetitive and aversive
stimulus features.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Nonlinear demixed component analysis for neural population data as a low-rank kernel regression problem. (arXiv:1812.08238v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08238</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08238</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here I introduce an extension to demixed principal component analysis (dPCA),
a linear dimensionality reduction technique for analyzing the activity of
neural populations, to the case of nonlinear dimensions. This is accomplished
using kernel methods, resulting in kernel demixed principal component analysis
(kdPCA). This extension resembles kernel-based extensions to standard principal
component analysis and canonical correlation analysis. kdPCA includes dPCA as a
special case when the kernel is linear. I present examples of simulated neural
activity that follows different low dimensional configurations and compare the
results of kdPCA to dPCA. These simulations demonstrate that nonlinear
interactions can impede the ability of dPCA to demix neural activity
corresponding to experimental parameters, but kdPCA can still recover
interpretable components. Additionally, I compare kdPCA and dPCA to a neural
population from rat orbitofrontal cortex during an odor classification task in
recovering decision-related activity.

	<description>Crystal structures of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) have revealed overlapping binding modes for synthetic and natural/endogenous ligands, indicating competition for the orthosteric pocket. Here we show that cobinding of a synthetic ligand to the orthosteric pocket can push natural and endogenous PPARγ ligands (fatty acids) out of the orthosteric pocket towards an alternate ligand-binding site near the functionally important omega (Ω) loop. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis coupled to quantitative biochemical functional and cellular assays reveal that synthetic ligand and fatty acid cobinding can form a 'ligand link' to the Ω loop and synergistically affect the structure and function of PPARγ. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating ligand binding to nuclear receptors can be more complex than the classical one-for-one orthosteric exchange of a natural or endogenous ligand with a synthetic ligand.</description>

	<description>Before primary motor cortex (M1) develops its motor functions, it functions like a somatosensory area. Here, by recording from neurons in the forelimb representation of M1 in postnatal day (P) 8-12 rats, we demonstrate a rapid shift in its sensory responses. At P8-10, M1 neurons respond overwhelmingly to feedback from sleep-related twitches of the forelimb, but the same neurons do not respond to wake-related movements. By P12, M1 neurons suddenly respond to wake movements, a transition that results from opening the sensory gate in the external cuneate nucleus. Also at P12, fewer M1 neurons respond to individual twitches, but the full complement of twitch-related feedback observed at P8 is unmasked through local disinhibition. Finally, through P12, M1 sensory responses originate in the deep thalamorecipient layers, not primary somatosensory cortex. These findings demonstrate that M1 initially establishes a sensory framework upon which its later-emerging role in motor control is built.</description>

	<description>Habituation is the process that enables salience filtering, precipitating perceptual changes that alter the value of environmental stimuli. To discern the neuronal circuits underlying habituation to brief inconsequential stimuli, we developed a novel olfactory habituation paradigm, identifying two distinct phases of the response that engage distinct neuronal circuits. Responsiveness to the continuous odor stimulus is maintained initially, a phase we term habituation latency and requires Rutabaga Adenylyl-Cyclase-depended neurotransmission from GABAergic Antennal Lobe Interneurons and activation of excitatory Projection Neurons (PNs) and the Mushroom Bodies. In contrast, habituation depends on the inhibitory PNs of the middle Antenno-Cerebral Track, requires inner Antenno-Cerebral Track PN activation and defines a temporally distinct phase. Collectively, our data support the involvement of Lateral Horn excitatory and inhibitory stimulation in habituation. These results provide essential cellular substrates for future analyses of the molecular mechanisms that govern the duration and transition between these distinct temporal habituation phases.</description>

	<description>We used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with Representational Similarity Analysis to probe neural activity associated with distinct, item-specific lexico-semantic predictions during language comprehension. MEG activity was measured as participants read highly constraining sentences in which the final words could be predicted. Before the onset of the predicted words, both the spatial and temporal patterns of brain activity were more similar when the same words were predicted than when different words were predicted. The temporal patterns localized to the left inferior and medial temporal lobe. These findings provide evidence that unique spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity are associated with item-specific lexico-semantic predictions. We suggest that the unique spatial patterns reflected the prediction of spatially distributed semantic features associated with the predicted word, and that the left inferior/medial temporal lobe played a role in temporally 'binding' these features, giving rise to unique lexico-semantic predictions.</description>

	<description>A recurrent theme in viral immune evasion is the sabotage of MHC-I antigen presentation, which brings virus the concomitant issue of 'missing-self' recognition by NK cells that use inhibitory receptors to detect surface MHC-I proteins. Here we report that rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP) encodes a Qa-1 like protein (pQa-1) via RNA splicing to counteract NK activation. While pQa-1 surface expression is stabilized by the same canonical peptides presented by murine Qa-1, pQa-1 is GPI-anchored and resistant to the activity of RHVP pK3, a ubiquitin ligase that targets MHC-I for degradation. pQa-1 tetramer staining indicates that it recognizes CD94/NKG2A receptors. Consistently, pQa-1 selectively inhibits NKG2A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NK cells and expression of pQa-1 can protect tumor cells from NK control &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Collectively these findings reveal an innovative NK evasion strategy wherein RHVP encodes a modified Qa-1 mimic refractory to MHC-I sabotage and capable of specifically engaging inhibitory receptors to circumvent NK activation.</description>

	<description>The piriform cortex (PCx) receives direct input from the olfactory bulb (OB) and is the brain's main station for odor recognition and memory. The transformation of the odor code from OB to PCx is profound: mitral and tufted cells in olfactory glomeruli respond to individual odorant molecules, whereas pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the PCx responds to multiple, apparently random combinations of activated glomeruli. How these 'discontinuous' receptive fields are formed from OB inputs remains unknown. Counter to the prevailing view that olfactory PNs sum their inputs passively, we show for the first time that NMDA spikes within individual dendrites can both amplify OB inputs and impose combination selectivity upon them, while their ability to compartmentalize voltage signals allows different dendrites to represent different odorant combinations. Thus, the 2-layer integrative behavior of olfactory PN dendrites provides a parsimonious account for the nonlinear remapping of the odor code from bulb to cortex.</description>

	<description>Changes in DNA methylation are involved in development, disease, and the response to environmental conditions. However, not all regulatory elements are functionally methylation-dependent (MD). Here, we report a method, mSTARR-seq, that assesses the causal effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity at hundreds of thousands of fragments (millions of CpG sites) simultaneously. Using mSTARR-seq, we identify thousands of MD regulatory elements in the human genome. MD activity is partially predictable using sequence and chromatin state information, and distinct transcription factors are associated with higher activity in unmethylated versus methylated DNA. Further, pioneer TFs linked to higher activity in the methylated state appear to drive demethylation of experimentally methylated sites. MD regulatory elements also predict methylation-gene expression relationships across individuals, where they are 1.6x enriched among sites with strong negative correlations. mSTARR-seq thus provides a map of MD regulatory activity in the human genome and facilitates interpretation of differential methylation studies.</description>

	<description>Transparent reporting is essential for the critical evaluation of studies. However, the reporting of statistical methods for studies in the biomedical sciences is often limited. This systematic review examines the quality of reporting for two statistical tests, t-tests and ANOVA, for papers published in a selection of physiology journals in June 2017. Of the 328 original research articles examined, 277 (84.5%) included an ANOVA or t-test or both. However, papers in our sample were routinely missing essential information about both types of tests: for example, 213 papers (95% of the papers that used ANOVA) did not contain the information needed to determine what type of ANOVA was performed, and 26.7% of papers did not specify what post-hoc test was performed. Most papers also omitted the information needed to verify ANOVA results. Essential information about t-tests was also missing in many papers. We conclude by discussing measures that could be taken to improve the quality of reporting.</description>

	<description>Proper regulation of germline gene expression is essential for fertility and maintaining species integrity. In the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; germline, a diverse repertoire of regulatory pathways promote the expression of endogenous germline genes and limit the expression of deleterious transcripts to maintain genome homeostasis. Here we show that the conserved TRIM-NHL protein, NHL-2, plays an essential role in the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; germline, modulating germline chromatin and meiotic chromosome organization. We uncover a role for NHL-2 as a co-factor in both positively (CSR-1) and negatively (HRDE-1) acting germline 22G-small RNA pathways and the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein and, along with RNA-seq data point to a small RNA independent role for NHL-2 in regulating transcripts at the level of RNA stability. Collectively, our data implicate NHL-2 as an essential hub of gene regulatory activity in both the germline and soma.</description>

The social transmission of information is critical to the emergence of animal culture. Two processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads in animal populations: the movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning. We develop a model that, for the first time, explicitly integrates these processes to investigate their impacts on the spread of behavioural preferences. Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and conformity in determining whether locally-variable traditions establish across a landscape or whether a single preference dominates the whole population. The model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits &lt;i&gt;Parus major&lt;/i&gt;, but also allows for a range of predictions for the emergence of animal culture under various initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias to be made. Integrating social behaviour with ecological variation will be important for understanding the stability and diversity of culture in animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hKz0zBUfxM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Rotors are functional reentry sources identified in clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular and atrial fibrillation. Ablation targeting rotor sites has resulted in arrhythmia termination. Recent clinical, experimental and modelling studies demonstrate that rotors are often anchored around fibrotic scars or regions with increased fibrosis. However the mechanisms leading to abundance of rotors at these locations are not clear. The current study explores the hypothesis whether fibrotic scars just serve as anchoring sites for the rotors or whether there are other active processes which drive the rotors to these fibrotic regions. Rotors were induced at different distances from fibrotic scars of various sizes and degree of fibrosis. Simulations were performed in a 2D model of human ventricular tissue and in a patient-specific model of the left ventricle of a patient with remote myocardial infarction. In both the 2D and the patient-specific model we found that without fibrotic scars, the rotors were stable at the site of their initiation. However, in the presence of a scar, rotors were eventually dynamically anchored from large distances by the fibrotic scar via a process of dynamical reorganization of the excitation pattern. This process coalesces with a change from polymorphic to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NeaY0mP8EJA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The physiochemical determinants of drug-target interactions in the microenvironment of the cell are complex and generally not defined by simple diffusion and intrinsic chemical reactivity. Non-specific interactions of drugs and macromolecules in cells are rarely considered formally in assessing pharmacodynamics. Here, we demonstrate that non-specific interactions lead to very slow incorporation kinetics of DNA binding drugs. We observe a rate of drug incorporation in cell nuclei three orders of magnitude slower than &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; due to anomalous drug diffusion within cells. This slow diffusion, however, has an advantageous consequence: it leads to virtually irreversible binding of the drug to specific DNA targets in cells. We show that non-specific interactions drive slow drug diffusion manifesting as slow reaction front propagation. We study the effect of non-specific interactions in different cellular compartments by permeabilization of plasma and nuclear membranes in order to pinpoint differential compartment effects on variability in intracellular drug kinetics. These results provide the basis for a comprehensive model of the determinants of intracellular diffusion of small-molecule drugs, their target-seeking trajectories, and the consequences of these processes on the apparent kinetics of drug-target interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H3aSE1U5f0Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Optogenetic Dissection of Temporal Dynamics of Amygdala-Striatal Interplay during Risk/Reward Decision Making</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc shows distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-&amp;gt;NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50–12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA-&amp;gt;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4- to 7-s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-&amp;gt;NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-&amp;gt;NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural correlates of episodic memory in the Memento cohort. (arXiv:1812.08031v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;IntroductionThe free and cued selective reminding test is used to identify
memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment and demented patients. It allows
assessing three processes: encoding, storage, and recollection of verbal
episodic memory.MethodsWe investigated the neural correlates of these three
memory processes in a large cohort study. The Memento cohort enrolled 2323
outpatients presenting either with subjective cognitive decline or mild
cognitive impairment who underwent cognitive, structural MRI and, for a subset,
fluorodeoxyglucose--positron emission tomography evaluations.ResultsEncoding
was associated with a network including parietal and temporal cortices; storage
was mainly associated with entorhinal and parahippocampal regions, bilaterally;
retrieval was associated with a widespread network encompassing frontal
regions.DiscussionThe neural correlates of episodic memory processes can be
assessed in large and standardized cohorts of patients at risk for Alzheimer's
disease. Their relation to pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease
remains to be studied.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07965</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Building on the model proposed in Lillicrap et. al. we show that deep
networks can be trained using biologically plausible Hebbian rules yielding
similar performance to ordinary back-propagation. To overcome the unrealistic
symmetry in connections between layers, implicit in back-propagation, the
feedback weights are separate from the feedforward weights. But, in contrast to
Lillicrap et. al., they are also updated with a local rule - a weight is
updated solely based on the activity of the units it connects. With fixed
feedback weights the performance degrades quickly as the depth of the network
increases, when they are updated the performance is comparable to regular
back-propagation. We also propose a cost function whose derivative can be
represented as a local update rule on the last layer. Convolutional layers are
updated with tied weights across space, which is not biologically plausible. We
show that similar performance is achieved with sparse layers corresponding to
the connectivity implied by the convolutional layers, but where weights are
untied and updated separately. In the linear case we show theoretically that
the convergence of the error to zero is accelerated by the update of the
feedback weights.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Training on the test set? An analysis of Spampinato et al. [arXiv:1609.00344]. (arXiv:1812.07697v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07697</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent paper [&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00344&quot;&gt;arXiv:1609.00344&lt;/a&gt;] claims to classify brain processing evoked
in subjects watching ImageNet stimuli as measured with EEG and to use a
representation derived from this processing to create a novel object
classifier. That paper, together with a series of subsequent papers [8, 15, 17,
20, 21, 30, 35], claims to revolutionize the field by achieving extremely
successful results on several computer-vision tasks, including object
classification, transfer learning, and generation of images depicting human
perception and thought using brain-derived representations measured through
EEG. Our novel experiments and analyses demonstrate that their results
crucially depend on the block design that they use, where all stimuli of a
given class are presented together, and fail with a rapid-event design, where
stimuli of different classes are randomly intermixed. The block design leads to
classification of arbitrary brain states based on block-level temporal
correlations that tend to exist in all EEG data, rather than stimulus-related
activity. Because every trial in their test sets comes from the same block as
many trials in the corresponding training sets, their block design thus leads
to surreptitiously training on the test set. This invalidates all subsequent
analyses performed on this data in multiple published papers and calls into
question all of the purported results. We further show that a novel object
classifier constructed with a random codebook performs as well as or better
than a novel object classifier constructed with the representation extracted
from EEG data, suggesting that the performance of their classifier constructed
with a representation extracted from EEG data does not benefit at all from the
brain-derived representation. Our results calibrate the underlying difficulty
of the tasks involved and caution against sensational and overly optimistic,
but false, claims to the contrary.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A re-inducible gap gene cascade patterns the anterior-posterior axis of insects in a threshold-free fashion</title>

	<description>Gap genes mediate the division of the anterior-posterior axis of insects into different fates through regulating downstream hox genes. Decades of tinkering the segmentation gene network of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; led to the conclusion that gap genes are regulated (at least initially) through a threshold-based mechanism, guided by both anteriorly- and posteriorly-localized morphogen gradients. In this paper, we show that the response of the gap gene network in the beetle &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;castaneum&lt;/i&gt; upon perturbation is consistent with a threshold-free 'Speed Regulation' mechanism, in which the speed of a genetic cascade of gap genes is regulated by a posterior morphogen gradient. We show this by re-inducing the leading gap gene (namely, &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt;) resulting in the re-induction of the gap gene cascade at arbitrary points in time. This demonstrates that the gap gene network is self-regulatory and is primarily under the control of a posterior regulator in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and possibly other short/intermediate-germ insects.</description>

	<description>Gene expression in all organisms is controlled by cooperative interactions between DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs), but quantitatively measuring TF-DNA and TF-TF interactions remains difficult. Here we introduce a strategy for precisely measuring the Gibbs free energy of such interactions in living cells. This strategy centers on the measurement and modeling of ‘allelic manifolds’, a multidimensional generalization of the classical genetics concept of allelic series. Allelic manifolds are measured using reporter assays performed on strategically designed cis-regulatory sequences. Quantitative biophysical models are then fit to the resulting data. We used this strategy to study regulation by two &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; TFs, CRP and &lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;σ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;70&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/math&gt; RNA polymerase. Doing so, we consistently obtained energetic measurements precise to &lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∼&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; kcal/mol. We also obtained multiple results that deviate from the prior literature. Our strategy is compatible with massively parallel reporter assays in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and should therefore be highly scalable and broadly applicable.</description>

	<description>Deep networks provide a potentially rich interconnection between neuroscientific and artificial approaches to understanding visual intelligence, but the relationship between artificial and neural representations of complex visual form has not been elucidated at the level of single-unit selectivity. Taking the approach of an electrophysiologist to characterizing single CNN units, we found many units exhibit translation-invariant boundary curvature selectivity approaching that of exemplar neurons in the primate mid-level visual area V4. For some V4-like units, particularly in middle layers, the natural images that drove them best were qualitatively consistent with selectivity for object boundaries. Our results identify a novel image-computable model for V4 boundary curvature selectivity and suggest that such a representation may begin to emerge within an artificial network trained for image categorization, even though boundary information was not provided during training. This raises the possibility that single-unit selectivity in CNNs will become a guide for understanding sensory cortex.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: PINK1 Interacts with VCP/p97 and Activates PKA to Promote NSFL1C/p47 Phosphorylation and Dendritic Arborization in Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 (PKA&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;(pT197)), a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study delineates a novel molecular mechanism by which PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and valosin-containing protein (VCP) interact to promote dendritic arborization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The systemDrive: a Multi-Site, Multi-Region Microdrive with Independent Drive Axis Angling for Chronic Multi-Modal Systems Neuroscience Recordings in Freely-Behaving Animals</title>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0261-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A multi-electrode system that can address widely-separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive: a novel multi-site, multi-region microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and non-parallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely-spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube-cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and non-parallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long Evans rats to observe simultaneous single- and multi- unit activity from multiple widely-separated sleep-wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The novel design of the systemDrive overcomes current microdrive limitations by providing the ability to finely position microwires through multiple widely-distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and non-parallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. This allows for targeting of a larger set of brain regions, including deep brainstem areas, as the electrodes do not emerge from a single area, initial driving points can be placed at set distances from targets, and electrodes can be placed along trajectories designed to minimize collateral damage to sensitive brain structures. This technology enables easier simultaneous monitoring and analysis of neural activity in multiple widely-spaced brain regions that comprise a fully interconnected neural circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the cognitive status of visually impaired patients referred to
low vision rehabilitation (LVR) based on a standard cognitive battery and a new
evaluation tool, named the COGEVIS, which can be used to assess patients with
severe visual deficits. We studied patients aged 60 and above, referred to the
LVR Hospital in Paris. Neurological and cognitive evaluations were performed in
an expert memory center. Thirty-eight individuals, 17 women and 21 men with a
mean age of 70.3 $\pm$ 1.3 years and a mean visual acuity of 0.12 $\pm$ 0.02,
were recruited over a one-year period. Sixty-three percent of participants had
normal cognitive status. Cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 37.5% of
participants. The COGEVIS score cutoff point to screen for cognitive impairment
was 24 (maximum score of 30) with a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of
95%. Evaluation following 4 months of visual rehabilitation showed an
improvement of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (p = 0 004), National
Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (p = 0 035), and
Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale (p = 0 037). This study
introduces a new short test to screen for cognitive impairment in visually
impaired patients.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Music and musical sonification for the rehabilitation of Parkinsonian dysgraphia: Conceptual framework. (arXiv:1812.07214v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07214</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Music has been shown to enhance motor control in patients with Parkinson's
disease (PD). Notably, musical rhythm is perceived as an external auditory cue
that helps PD patients to better control movements. The rationale of such
effects is that motor control based on auditory guidance would activate a
compensatory brain network that minimizes the recruitment of the defective
pathway involving the basal ganglia. Would associating music to movement
improve its perception and control in PD? Musical sonification consists in
modifying in real-time the playback of a preselected music according to some
movement parameters. The validation of such a method is underway for
handwriting in PD patients. When confirmed, this study will strengthen the
clinical interest of musical sonification in motor control and (re)learning in
PD.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Feedback through graph motifs relates structure and function in complex networks. (arXiv:1605.09073v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09073</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09073</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In physics, biology and engineering, network systems abound. How does the
connectivity of a network system combine with the behavior of its individual
components to determine its collective function? We approach this question for
networks with linear time-invariant dynamics by relating internal network
feedbacks to the statistical prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of
surprisingly simple and local statistics of connectivity. This results in a
reduced order model of the network input-output dynamics in terms of motifs
structures. As an example, the new formulation dramatically simplifies the
classic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the overall network behavior to one
proportional feedback wrapped around the dynamics of a single node. For general
networks, higher-order motifs systematically provide further layers and types
of feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local connectivity
shapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole, and we show
how this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as extending the time
constant with which networks remember past signals. The theory also extends to
networks composed from heterogeneous nodes with distinct dynamics and
connectivity, and patterned input to (and readout from) subsets of nodes. These
statistical descriptions provide a powerful theoretical framework to understand
the functionality of real-world network systems, as we illustrate with examples
including the mouse brain connectome.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Evoked transients of pH-sensitive fluorescent false neurotransmitter reveal dopamine hot spots in the globus pallidus</title>

	<description>Dopamine neurotransmission is suspected to play important physiological roles in multiple sparsely innervated brain nuclei, but there has not been a means to measure synaptic dopamine release in such regions. The globus pallidus externa (GPe) is a major locus in the basal ganglia that displays a sparse innervation of &lt;i&gt;en passant&lt;/i&gt; dopamine axonal fibers. Due to the low levels of innervation that preclude electrochemical analysis, it is unknown if these axons engage in neurotransmission. To address this, we introduce an optical approach using a pH-sensitive fluorescent false neurotransmitter, FFN102, that exhibits increased fluorescence upon exocytosis from the acidic synaptic vesicle to the neutral extracellular milieu. In marked contrast to the striatum, FFN102 transients in the mouse GPe were spatially heterogeneous, smaller than in striatum with the exception of sparse hot spots, and significantly enhanced by high frequency stimulation. Our results support hot spots of dopamine release from substantia nigra axons.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Downsizing the molecular spring of the giant protein titin reveals that skeletal muscle titin determines passive stiffness and drives longitudinal hypertrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40532</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40532</link>
	<description>Titin, the largest protein known, forms an elastic myofilament in the striated muscle sarcomere. To establish titin’s contribution to skeletal muscle passive stiffness, relative to that of the extracellular matrix, a mouse model was created in which titin’s molecular spring region was shortened by deleting 47 exons, the &lt;i&gt;Ttn&lt;sup&gt;Δ112-158&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; model. RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy predicts a much stiffer titin molecule. Mechanical studies with this novel mouse model support that titin is the main determinant of skeletal muscle passive stiffness. Unexpectedly, the in vivo sarcomere length working range was shifted to shorter lengths in &lt;i&gt;Ttn&lt;sup&gt;Δ112-158&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, due to a ~ 30% increase in the number of sarcomeres in series (longitudinal hypertrophy). The expected effect of this shift on active force generation was minimized through a shortening of thin filaments that was discovered in &lt;i&gt;Ttn&lt;sup&gt;Δ112-158&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Thus, skeletal muscle titin is the dominant determinant of physiological passive stiffness and drives longitudinal hypertrophy.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Positive Allosteric Modulation of AMPAR by PF-4778574 Produced Rapid Onset Antidepressant Actions in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy324</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy324/5253205?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It has been reported that fast-acting antidepressants enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the fast-acting antidepressants lead to an activation of AMPAR pathways remain largely unclear. To address this issue, a novel AMPAR positive allosteric agonist, PF-4778574, was used to test the rapid effects and the role of VGF (nonacronymic)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/AKT signaling in these actions in mice. We found that PF-4778574 rapidly alleviated chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, knock down of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in the PFC of mice induced depression-like behaviors, whereas treatment with PF-4778574 was sufficient to alleviate it, indicating a presynaptic VGLUT1 independent effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibitors of AMPAR or of L-type voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (L-VDCC) blocked the antidepressants’ effect on behaviors and the upregulation on the AMPAR-mediated VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling of PF-4778574. Together, our findings indicate that postsynaptic AMPAR activation followed by activation of L-VDCC and subsequent VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling are required for the rapid antidepressant effects of PF-4778574. Our data support a promising therapeutic profile for PF-4778574 as a new fast-acting antidepressant.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Superficial White Matter in Autism and Its Role in Connectivity Anomalies and Symptom Severity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy321</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the majority of neuroimaging studies have focused on the analysis of cortical morphology. White matter changes remain less understood, particularly their association to cortical structure and function. Here, we focused on region that has gained only little attention in ASD neuroimaging: the superficial white matter (SWM) immediately beneath the cortical interface, a compartment playing a prominent role in corticogenesis that incorporates long- and short-range fibers implicated in corticocortical connectivity. Studying a multicentric dataset of ASD and neurotypical controls, we harnessed surface-based techniques to aggregate microstructural SWM diffusion features. Multivariate analysis revealed SWM anomalies in ASD compared with controls in medial parietal and temporoparietal regions. Effects were similar in children and adolescents/adults and consistent across sites. Although SWM anomalies were more confined when correcting for cortical thickness and surface area, findings were overall robust. Diffusion anomalies modulated functional connectivity reductions in ASD and related to symptom severity. Furthermore, mediation models indicated a link between SWM changes, functional connectivity, and symptom load. Analyses targeting the SWM offer a novel perspective on the interplay between structural and functional network perturbations in ASD, highlighting a potentially important neurobiological substrate contributing to its diverse behavioral phenotype.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Building the Arrow of Time… Over Time: A Sequence of Brain Activity Mapping Imagined Events in Time and Space</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy320</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When moving, the spatiotemporal unfolding of events is bound to our physical trajectory, and time and space become entangled in episodic memory. When imagining past or future events, or being in different geographical locations, the temporal and spatial dimensions of mental events can be independently accessed and manipulated. Using time-resolved neuroimaging, we characterized brain activity while participants ordered historical events from different mental perspectives in time (e.g., when imagining being 9 years in the future) or in space (e.g., when imagining being in Cayenne). We describe 2 neural signatures of temporal ordinality: an early brain response distinguishing whether participants were mentally in the past, the present or the future (self-projection in time), and a graded activity at event retrieval, indexing the mental distance between the representation of the self in time and the event. Neural signatures of ordinality and symbolic distances in time were distinct from those observed in the homologous spatial task: activity indicating spatial order and distances overlapped in latency in distinct brain regions. We interpret our findings as evidence that the conscious representation of time and space share algorithms (egocentric mapping, distance, and ordinality computations) but different implementations with a distinctive status for the psychological “time arrow.”&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Comparison of Amyloid β and Tau Spread Models in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy311</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy311/5253203?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Tau and amyloid β (Aβ), 2 key pathogenic proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), reportedly spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Models of how these pathogenic proteins spread from affected to unaffected areas had been proposed based on the observation that these proteins could transmit to other regions either through neural fibers (transneuronal spread model) or through extracellular space (local spread model). In this study, we modeled the spread of tau and Aβ using a graph theoretical approach based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We tested whether these models predict the distribution of tau and Aβ in the brains of AD spectrum patients. To assess the models’ performance, we calculated spatial correlation between the model-predicted map and the actual map from tau and amyloid positron emission tomography. The transneuronal spread model predicted the distribution of tau and Aβ deposition with significantly higher accuracy than the local spread model. Compared with tau, the local spread model also predicted a comparable portion of Aβ deposition. These findings provide evidence of transneuronal spread of AD pathogenic proteins in a large-scale brain network and furthermore suggest different contributions of spread models for tau and Aβ in AD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sex Differences Along the Autism Continuum: A Twin Study of Brain Structure</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Females might possess protective mechanisms regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and require a higher detrimental load, including structural brain alterations, before developing clinically relevant levels of autistic traits. This study examines sex differences in structural brain morphology in autism and autistic traits using a within-twin pair approach. Twin design inherently controls for shared confounders and enables the study of gene-independent neuroanatomical variation. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 148 twins (62 females) from 49 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic same-sex pairs were included. Participants were distributed along the whole continuum of autism including twin pairs discordant and concordant for clinical ASD. Regional brain volume, surface area, and cortical thickness were computed. Within-twin pair increases in autistic traits were related to decreases in cortical volume and surface area of temporal and frontal regions specifically in female twin pairs, in particular regions involved in social communication, while only two regions were associated with autistic traits in males. The same pattern was detected in the monozygotic twin pairs only. Thus, non-shared environmental factors seem to impact female more than male cerebral architecture associated with autistic traits. Our results are in line with the hypothesis of a female protective effect in autism and highlights the need to study ASD in females separately from males.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cell-Type-Specific D1 Dopamine Receptor Modulation of Projection Neurons and Interneurons in the Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Dopamine modulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates diverse effects on neuronal physiology and function, but the expression of dopamine receptors at subpopulations of projection neurons and interneurons remains unresolved. Here, we examine D1 receptor expression and modulation at specific cell types and layers in the mouse prelimbic PFC. We first show that D1 receptors are enriched in pyramidal cells in both layers 5 and 6, and that these cells project to intratelencephalic targets including contralateral cortex, striatum, and claustrum rather than to extratelencephalic structures. We then find that D1 receptors are also present in interneurons and enriched in superficial layer VIP-positive (VIP+) interneurons that coexpresses calretinin but absent from parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons. Finally, we determine that D1 receptors strongly and selectively enhance action potential firing in only a subset of these corticocortical neurons and VIP+ interneurons. Our findings define several novel subpopulations of D1+ neurons, highlighting how modulation via D1 receptors can influence both excitatory and disinhibitory microcircuits in the PFC.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Gentle touch sensation in mammals depends on synaptic transmission from primary sensory cells (Merkel cells) to secondary sensory neurons. Hoffman et al. (2018) identify norepinephrine and β2-adrendergic receptors as the neurotransmitter-receptor pair responsible for sustained touch responses. The findings may deepen understanding of how drugs affect touch and pain sensation.</description>

	<description>The previous decade has seen a rapid increase in microglial studies on pain, with a unique focus on microgliosis in the spinal cord after nerve injury and neuropathic pain. Numerous signaling molecules are altered in microglia and contribute to the pathogenesis of pain. Here, we discuss how microglial signaling regulates spinal cord synaptic plasticity in acute and chronic pain conditions with different degrees and variations of microgliosis. We highlight that microglial mediators such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are powerful neuromodulators that regulate synaptic transmission and pain via neuron-glial interactions. We also reveal an emerging role of microglia in the resolution of pain, in part via specialized pro-resolving mediators including resolvins, protectins, and maresins. We also discuss a possible role of microglia in chronic itch.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Local epigenomic state cannot discriminate interacting and non-interacting enhancer–promoter pairs with high accuracy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wang Xi, Michael A. Beer&lt;/p&gt;

We report an experimental design issue in recent machine learning formulations of the enhancer-promoter interaction problem arising from the fact that many enhancer-promoter pairs share features. Cross-fold validation schemes which do not correctly separate these feature sharing enhancer-promoter pairs into one test set report high accuracy, which is actually arising from high training set accuracy and a failure to properly evaluate generalization performance. Cross-fold validation schemes which properly segregate pairs with shared features show markedly reduced ability to predict enhancer-promoter interactions from epigenomic state. Parameter scans with multiple models indicate that local epigenomic features of individual pairs of enhancers and promoters cannot distinguish those pairs that interact from those which do with high accuracy, suggesting that additional information is required to predict enhancer-promoter interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ku6iX2aK_S8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Adenosine Signaling through A1 Receptors Inhibits Chemosensitive Neurons in the Retrotrapezoid Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0404-18.2018?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0404-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, DPCPX; 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons shows that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of EPSCs but not IPSCs. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (GIRK)-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Superior Visual Timing Sensitivity in Auditory But Not Visual World Class Drum Corps Experts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0241-18.2018?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0241-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from the color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly subdivide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments (TOJs) more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right, called a TOJ. Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard members from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did the color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 ms (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 ms (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intramodally, even when intramodal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the timing sensitivity of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Ovarian Cycle Stages Modulate Alzheimer-Related Cognitive and Brain Network Alterations in Female Mice</title>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0132-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that ovarian cycle stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice and increasing amyloid beta levels. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Single neuron properties shape chaotic dynamics in random neural networks. (arXiv:1812.06925v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical neurons exhibit rich dynamics, shaped by the presence of
history-dependent biophysical mechanisms such as adaptation over different time
scales. On the other hand, cortical circuits are highly recurrent which can
result in chaotic network dynamics even if network nodes have simple dynamics.
We analyze how the dynamics of nodes (such as single neurons) and recurrent
connections interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly
connected networks. A novel dynamical mean-field theory for networks of
multi-dimensional rate units shows that, despite the nonlinear interactions
between units, the recurrent network dynamics inherit, in the chaotic phase,
the qualitative features of the linear response properties of the single units.
For the case of two-dimensional rate units with strong adaptation, we find that
the network exhibits a state of &quot;resonant chaos&quot;, whose resonance frequency can
be predicted from the properties of isolated units. The correlation time of the
chaotic network scales with the adaptation timescale of a single unit. Our
theory for network analysis can be applied to numerous other mechanisms at the
level of single nodes, such as synaptic filtering, refractoriness or spike
synchronization. These results advance our understanding of the interaction
between single-neuron mechanisms and recurrent connectivity, a fundamental step
toward the description of biologically realistic network models in the brain,
or, more generally, networks of other physical or man-made complex dynamical
units.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Effect of Onset Age of Visual Deprivation on Visual Cortex Surface Area Across-Species</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Blindness early in life induces permanent alterations in brain anatomy, including reduced surface area of primary visual cortex (V1). Bilateral enucleation early in development causes greater reductions in primary visual cortex surface area than at later times. However, the time at which cortical surface area expansion is no longer sensitive to enucleation is not clearly established, despite being an important milestone for cortical development. Using histological and MRI techniques, we investigated how reductions in the surface area of V1 depends on the timing of blindness onset in rats, ferrets and humans. To compare data across species, we translated ages of all species to a common neuro-developmental event-time (ET) scale. Consistently, blindness during early cortical expansion induced large (~40%) reductions in V1 surface area, in rats and ferrets, while blindness occurring later had diminishing effects. Longitudinal measurements on ferrets confirmed that early enucleation disrupted cortical expansion, rather than inducing enhanced pruning. We modeled the ET associated with the conclusion of the effect of blindness on surface area at maturity (ET&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), relative to the normal conclusion of visual cortex surface area expansion, (ET&lt;sub&gt;dev)&lt;/sub&gt;. A final analysis combining our data with extant published data confirmed that ET&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; occurred well before ET&lt;sub&gt;dev&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian inference of protein conformational ensembles from limited structural data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006641</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wojciech Potrzebowski, Jill Trewhella, Ingemar Andre&lt;/p&gt;

Many proteins consist of folded domains connected by regions with higher flexibility. The details of the resulting conformational ensemble play a central role in controlling interactions between domains and with binding partners. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is well-suited to study the conformational states adopted by proteins in solution. However, analysis is complicated by the limited information content in SAS data and care must be taken to avoid constructing overly complex ensemble models and fitting to noise in the experimental data. To address these challenges, we developed a method based on Bayesian statistics that infers conformational ensembles from a structural library generated by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. The first stage of the method involves a fast model selection based on variational Bayesian inference that maximizes the model evidence of the selected ensemble. This is followed by a complete Bayesian inference of population weights in the selected ensemble. Experiments with simulated ensembles demonstrate that model evidence is capable of identifying the correct ensemble and that correct number of ensemble members can be recovered up to high level of noise. Using experimental data, we demonstrate how the method can be extended to include data from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and structural energies of conformers extracted from the all-atom energy functions. We show that the data from SAXS, NMR chemical shifts and energies calculated from conformers can work synergistically to improve the definition of the conformational ensemble.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vea5WEX4qTU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Early assessment of infectious disease outbreaks is key to implementing timely and effective control measures. In particular, rapidly recognising whether infected individuals stem from a single outbreak sustained by local transmission, or from repeated introductions, is crucial to adopt effective interventions. In this study, we introduce a new framework for combining several data streams, e.g. temporal, spatial and genetic data, to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. Our method explicitly accounts for underreporting, and allows incorporating preexisting information about the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate. We define, for each data stream, a graph connecting all cases, with edges weighted by the corresponding pairwise distance between cases. Each graph is then pruned by removing distances greater than a given cutoff, defined based on preexisting information on the disease and assumptions on the reporting rate. The pruned graphs corresponding to different data streams are then merged by intersection to combine all data types; connected components define clusters of cases related for all types of data. Estimates of the reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), and the rate of importation of the disease into the population, are also derived. We test our approach on simulated data and illustrate it using data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. We show that the outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex, computationally intensive approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Azw7xP5tw5w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Laferrière et al. now establish that TDP-43 assemblies from distinct FTD subtypes have different structures, neurotoxicities, and seeding activities, which correlate with FTD severity. Thus, distinct pathological TDP-43 assemblies akin to prion strains might underpin distinct FTD subtypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/iG3FwIxyfag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Breakdown of Imagined Visuomotor Transformations and Its Neural Correlates in Young Elderly Subjects</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy314/5248516?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Several studies have shown age-related changes in motor imagery (MI) in older adults and the associated compensatory brain activation patterns; most of these studies have used explicit MI tasks or implicit MI tasks focused on mental rotation of body parts. Here, we address the effect of ageing on MI for the more complex visuomotor transformations entailed by mentally simulated hand-tool interactions triggered by a grip selection task (GST) for tools used in daily life. We studied 22 young and 22 elderly subjects performing the GST, in which they were asked to report whether they would grip a portrayed tool with an overhand or an underhand grip. We found a behavioral decline in the elderly group, accompanied by reduced activations of the left posterior parietal lobule, in a subregion associated specifically with reaching behavior by previous investigations. No differences were observed in the temporal cortices associated with object semantics. These results suggested a specific age-related vulnerability of the neural substrates, particularly for the imaginary reaching component of the task, rather than for the semantically driven grasping component. The combination of behavioral deficits and reduced activation of specific brain regions speaks in favor of a specific age-associated deficit for the complex imaginary movements required by the GST.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Brain Functional Organization Associated With Language Lateralization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy313</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy313/5248525?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although it is well-established that human language functions are mostly lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain, little is known about the functional mechanisms underlying such hemispheric dominance. The present study investigated intrinsic organization of the whole brain at rest, by means of functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis, with the aim to characterize brain functional organization underlying typical and atypical language dominance. We included healthy left-handers, both those with typical left-lateralized language and those with atypical right-lateralized language. Results show that 1) differences between typical and atypical language lateralization are associated with functional connectivity within the language system, particularly with weakened connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and several other language-related areas; and 2) for participants with atypical language dominance, the degree of lateralization is linked with multiple functional connectivities and graph theoretical metrics of whole brain organization, including local efficiency and small-worldness. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that linked the degree of language lateralization to global topology of brain networks. These results reveal that typical and atypical language dominance mainly differ in functional connectivity within the language system, and that atypical language dominance is associated with whole-brain organization.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Advances in sequencing technology have significantly expanded our understanding of the genetics of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Continued technological improvements and cost reductions have now shifted the focus to investigations into the functional noncoding portions of the genome. There is a patient trend toward an excess of de novo and potentially disruptive mutations among conserved noncoding sequences implicated in the regulation of genes. The signals become stronger when restricted to genes already implicated in NDDs, but de novo mutation in such elements is estimated to account for &amp;lt;5% of patients.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiscale computational model of Achilles tendon wound healing: Untangling the effects of repair and loading</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006652</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mEQz9FfgNME/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kellen Chen, Xiao Hu, Silvia S. Blemker, Jeffrey W. Holmes&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical stimulation of the healing tendon is thought to regulate scar anisotropy and strength and is relatively easy to modulate through physical therapy. However, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of various loading protocols in animal models have produced mixed results. To integrate and better understand the available data, we developed a multiscale model of rat Achilles tendon healing that incorporates the effect of changes in the mechanical environment on fibroblast behavior, collagen deposition, and scar formation. We modified an OpenSim model of the rat right hindlimb to estimate physiologic strains in the lateral/medial gastrocnemius and soleus musculo-tendon units during loading and unloading conditions. We used the tendon strains as inputs to a thermodynamic model of stress fiber dynamics that predicts fibroblast alignment, and to determine local collagen synthesis rates according to a response curve derived from &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies. We then used an agent-based model (ABM) of scar formation to integrate these cell-level responses and predict tissue-level collagen alignment and content. We compared our model predictions to experimental data from ten different studies. We found that a single set of cellular response curves can explain features of observed tendon healing across a wide array of reported experiments in rats–including the paradoxical finding that repairing transected tendon reverses the effect of loading on alignment–without fitting model parameters to any data from those experiments. The key to these successful predictions was simulating the specific loading and surgical protocols to predict tissue-level strains, which then guided cellular behaviors according to response curves based on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Our model results provide a potential explanation for the highly variable responses to mechanical loading reported in the tendon healing literature and may be useful in guiding the design of future experiments and interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEQz9FfgNME&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of antibiotic resistance in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; from large-scale pan-genome data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006258</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Danesh Moradigaravand, Martin Palm, Anne Farewell, Ville Mustonen, Jonas Warringer, Leopold Parts&lt;/p&gt;

The emergence of microbial antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. In clinical settings, the key to controlling spread of resistant strains is accurate and rapid detection. As traditional culture-based methods are time consuming, genetic approaches have recently been developed for this task. The detection of antibiotic resistance is typically made by measuring a few known determinants previously identified from genome sequencing, and thus requires the prior knowledge of its biological mechanisms. To overcome this limitation, we employed machine learning models to predict resistance to 11 compounds across four classes of antibiotics from existing and novel whole genome sequences of 1936 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains. We considered a range of methods, and examined population structure, isolation year, gene content, and polymorphism information as predictors. Gradient boosted decision trees consistently outperformed alternative models with an average accuracy of 0.91 on held-out data (range 0.81–0.97). While the best models most frequently employed gene content, an average accuracy score of 0.90 could be obtained using population structure information alone. Single nucleotide variation data were less useful, and significantly improved prediction only for two antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin. These results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; can be accurately predicted from whole genome sequences without &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; knowledge of mechanisms, and that both genomic and epidemiological data can be informative. This paves way to integrating machine learning approaches into diagnostic tools in the clinic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LeuFxHi0YgQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: G-quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of all known human viruses: A comprehensive guide</title>

G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic-acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that occurrence and location of PQSs are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the PQS classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all PQS present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each PQS in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of PQS abundance. This information is accessible from a database to allow the easy navigation of the results: http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php?id=g4virus. The availability of these data will greatly expedite research on G-quadruplex in viruses, with the possibility to accelerate finding therapeutic opportunities to numerous and some fearsome human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YGXummEGfTY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Next generation sequencing of viral populations has advanced our understanding of viral population dynamics, the development of drug resistance, and escape from host immune responses. Many applications require complete gene sequences, which can be impossible to reconstruct from short reads. HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;, the protein of interest for HIV vaccine studies, is exceptionally challenging for long-read sequencing and analysis due to its length, high substitution rate, and extensive indel variation. While long-read sequencing is attractive in this setting, the analysis of such data is not well handled by existing methods. To address this, we introduce FLEA (Full-Length Envelope Analyzer), which performs end-to-end analysis and visualization of long-read sequencing data. FLEA consists of both a pipeline (optionally run on a high-performance cluster), and a client-side web application that provides interactive results. The pipeline transforms FASTQ reads into high-quality consensus sequences (HQCSs) and uses them to build a codon-aware multiple sequence alignment. The resulting alignment is then used to infer phylogenies, selection pressure, and evolutionary dynamics. The web application provides publication-quality plots and interactive visualizations, including an annotated viral alignment browser, time series plots of evolutionary dynamics, visualizations of gene-wide selective pressures (such as &lt;i&gt;dN&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;dS&lt;/i&gt;) across time and across protein structure, and a phylogenetic tree browser. We demonstrate how FLEA may be used to process Pacific Biosciences HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt; data and describe recent examples of its use. Simulations show how FLEA dramatically reduces the error rate of this sequencing platform, providing an accurate portrait of complex and variable HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt; populations. A public instance of FLEA is hosted at http://flea.datamonkey.org. The Python source code for the FLEA pipeline can be found at https://github.com/veg/flea-pipeline. The client-side application is available at https://github.com/veg/flea-web-app. A live demo of the P018 results can be found at http://flea.murrell.group/view/P018.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5IGD6XUDrjc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Coherent chaos in a recurrent neural network with structured connectivity</title>

We present a simple model for coherent, spatially correlated chaos in a recurrent neural network. Networks of randomly connected neurons exhibit chaotic fluctuations and have been studied as a model for capturing the temporal variability of cortical activity. The dynamics generated by such networks, however, are spatially uncorrelated and do not generate coherent fluctuations, which are commonly observed across spatial scales of the neocortex. In our model we introduce a structured component of connectivity, in addition to random connections, which effectively embeds a feedforward structure via unidirectional coupling between a pair of orthogonal modes. Local fluctuations driven by the random connectivity are summed by an output mode and drive coherent activity along an input mode. The orthogonality between input and output mode preserves chaotic fluctuations by preventing feedback loops. In the regime of weak structured connectivity we apply a perturbative approach to solve the dynamic mean-field equations, showing that in this regime coherent fluctuations are driven passively by the chaos of local residual fluctuations. When we introduce a row balance constraint on the random connectivity, stronger structured connectivity puts the network in a distinct dynamical regime of self-tuned coherent chaos. In this regime the coherent component of the dynamics self-adjusts intermittently to yield periods of slow, highly coherent chaos. The dynamics display longer time-scales and switching-like activity. We show how in this regime the dynamics depend qualitatively on the particular realization of the connectivity matrix: a complex leading eigenvalue can yield coherent oscillatory chaos while a real leading eigenvalue can yield chaos with broken symmetry. The level of coherence grows with increasing strength of structured connectivity until the dynamics are almost entirely constrained to a single spatial mode. We examine the effects of network-size scaling and show that these results are not finite-size effects. Finally, we show that in the regime of weak structured connectivity, coherent chaos emerges also for a generalized structured connectivity with multiple input-output modes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h3dba5py_SI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long-Lasting Electrophysiological After-Effects of High-Frequency Stimulation in the Globus Pallidus: Human and Rodent Slice Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10734?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) is a highly effective therapy for movement disorders, yet its mechanism of action remains controversial. Inhibition of local neurons because of release of GABA from afferents to the GPi is a proposed mechanism in patients. Yet, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) produces prolonged membrane depolarization mediated by cholinergic neurotransmission in endopeduncular nucleus (EP, GPi equivalent in rodent) neurons. We applied HFS while recording neuronal firing from an adjacent electrode during microelectrode mapping of GPi in awake patients (both male and female) with Parkinson disease (PD) and dystonia. Aside from after-suppression and no change in neuronal firing, high-frequency microstimulation induced after-facilitation in 38% (26/69) of GPi neurons. In neurons displaying after-facilitation, 10 s HFS led to an immediate decrease of bursting in PD, but not dystonia patients. Moreover, the changes of bursting patterns in neurons with after-suppression or no change after HFS, were similar in both patient groups. To explore the mechanisms responsible, we applied HFS in EP brain slices from rats of either sex. As in humans, HFS in EP induced two subtypes of after-excitation: excitation or excitation with late inhibition. Pharmacological experiments determined that the excitation subtype, induced by lower charge density, was dependent on glutamatergic transmission. HFS with higher charge density induced excitation with late inhibition, which involved cholinergic modulation. Therefore HFS with different charge density may affect the local neurons through multiple synaptic mechanisms. The cholinergic system plays a role in mediating the after-facilitatory effects in GPi neurons, and because of their modulatory nature, may provide a basis for both the immediate and delayed effects of GPi-DBS. We propose a new model to explain the mechanisms of DBS in GPi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) improves Parkinson disease (PD) and dystonia, yet its mechanisms in GPi remain controversial. Inhibition has been previously described and thought to indicate activation of GABAergic synaptic terminals, which dominate in GPi. Here we report that 10 s high-frequency microstimulation induced after-facilitation of neural firing in a substantial proportion of GPi neurons in humans. The neurons with after-facilitation, also immediately reduced their bursting activities after high-frequency stimulation in PD, but not dystonia patients. Based on these data and further animal experiments, a mechanistic hypothesis involving glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic synaptic transmission is proposed to explain both short- and longer-term therapeutic effects of DBS in GPi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For many animals, target motion carries high ecological significance as this may be generated by a predator, prey, or potential mate. Indeed, animals whose survival depends on early target detection are often equipped with a sharply tuned visual system, yielding robust performance in challenging conditions. For example, many fast-flying insects use visual cues for identifying targets, such as prey (e.g., predatory dragonflies and robberflies) or conspecifics (e.g., nonpredatory hoverflies), and can often do so against self-generated background optic flow. Supporting these behaviors, the optic lobes of insects that pursue targets harbor neurons that respond robustly to the motion of small moving objects, even when displayed against syn-directional background clutter. However, in diptera, the encoding of target information by the descending neurons, which are more directly involved in generating the behavioral output, has received less attention. We characterized target-selective neurons by recording in the ventral nerve cord of male and female predatory &lt;i&gt;Holcocephala fusca&lt;/i&gt; robberflies and of male nonpredatory &lt;i&gt;Eristalis tenax&lt;/i&gt; hoverflies. We show that both species have dipteran target-selective descending neurons that only respond to target motion if the background is stationary or moving slowly, moves in the opposite direction, or has un-naturalistic spatial characteristics. The response to the target is suppressed when background and target move at similar velocities, which is strikingly different to the response of target neurons in the optic lobes. As the neurons we recorded from are premotor, our findings affect our interpretation of the neurophysiology underlying target-tracking behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many animals use sensory cues to detect moving targets that may represent predators, prey, or conspecifics. For example, birds of prey show superb sensitivity to the motion of small prey, and intercept these at high speeds. In a similar manner, predatory insects visually track moving prey, often against cluttered backgrounds. Accompanying this behavior, the brains of insects that pursue targets contain neurons that respond exclusively to target motion. We here show that dipteran insects also have target-selective descending neurons in the part of their nervous system that corresponds to the vertebrate spinal cord. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the neurons in the brain, these premotor neurons are inhibited by background patterns moving in the same direction as the target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Detailed Visual Cortical Responses Generated by Retinal Sheet Transplants in Rats with Severe Retinal Degeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To combat retinal degeneration, healthy fetal retinal sheets have been successfully transplanted into both rodent models and humans, with synaptic connectivity between transplant and degenerated host retina having been confirmed. In rodent studies, transplants have been shown to restore responses to flashes of light in a region of the superior colliculus corresponding to the location of the transplant in the host retina. To determine the quality and detail of visual information provided by the transplant, visual responsivity was studied here at the level of visual cortex where higher visual perception is processed. For our model, we used the transgenic &lt;i&gt;Rho-S334ter line-3&lt;/i&gt; rat (both sexes), which loses photoreceptors at an early age and is effectively blind at postnatal day 30. These rats received fetal retinal sheet transplants in one eye between 24 and 40 d of age. Three to 10 months following surgery, visually responsive neurons were found in regions of primary visual cortex matching the transplanted region of the retina that were as highly selective as normal rat to stimulus orientation, size, contrast, and spatial and temporal frequencies. Conversely, we found that selective response properties were largely absent in nontransplanted &lt;i&gt;line-3&lt;/i&gt; rats. Our data show that fetal retinal sheet transplants can result in remarkably normal visual function in visual cortex of rats with a degenerated host retina and represents a critical step toward developing an effective remedy for the visually impaired human population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa lead to profound vision loss in millions of people worldwide. Many patients lose both retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Hence, there is a great demand for the development of efficient techniques that allow for long-term vision restoration. In this study, we transplanted dissected fetal retinal sheets, which can differentiate into photoreceptors and integrate with the host retina of rats with severe retinal degeneration. Remarkably, we show that transplants generated visual responses in cortex similar in quality to normal rats. Furthermore, transplants preserved connectivity within visual cortex and the retinal relay from the lateral geniculate nucleus to visual cortex, supporting their potential application in curing vision loss associated with retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Membrane Potential Correlates of Network Decorrelation and Improved SNR by Cholinergic Activation in the Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10692?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nucleus basalis (NB) projects cholinergic axons to the cortex, where they play a major role in arousal, attention, and learning. Cholinergic inputs shift cortical dynamics from synchronous to asynchronous and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensory responses. However, the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Using simultaneous extracellular and whole-cell patch recordings in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex, we show that electrical or optogenetic activation of the cholinergic system has a differential effect on ongoing and sensory evoked activities. Cholinergic activation profoundly reduced the large spontaneous fluctuations in membrane potential and decorrelated ongoing activity. However, NB stimulation had no effect on the response to whisker stimulation or on signal correlations. These effects of cholinergic activation provide a unified explanation for the increased SNR of sensory response and for the reduction in noise correlations and explain the shift into the desynchronized cortical state, which are the hallmarks of arousal and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Attention increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of cortical sensory response, which may reflect either reduction in background firing rate or increased sensory response. Extracellular recordings showed that attention also reduces the correlation in network activity. These effects are partially mediated by cholinergic axons from the nucleus basalis projecting to the entire cortex. To reveal the cellular and synaptic correlates of these cholinergic effects, we performed simultaneous intracellular and LFP recordings in the somatosensory cortex. Global or local cholinergic activation increased the SNR of sensory response mainly by reducing the rate and amplitude of background synaptic activity and also reduced network correlations. Therefore, coding of sensory information is enhanced by the cholinergic system mainly due to a reduction in spontaneous activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Characterization of Brain Dysfunction Induced by Bacterial Lipopeptides That Alter Neuronal Activity and Network in Rodent Brains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10672?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The immunopathological states of the brain induced by bacterial lipoproteins have been well characterized by using biochemical and histological assays. However, these studies have limitations in determining functional states of damaged brains involving aberrant synaptic activity and network, which makes it difficult to diagnose brain disorders during bacterial infection. To address this, we investigated the effect of Pam&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CSK&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (PAM), a synthetic bacterial lipopeptide, on synaptic dysfunction of female mice brains and cultured neurons in parallel. Our functional brain imaging using PET with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] flumazenil revealed that the brain dysfunction induced by PAM is closely aligned to disruption of neurotransmitter-related neuronal activity and functional correlation in the region of the limbic system rather than to decrease of metabolic activity of neurons in the injection area. This finding was verified by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tissue experiments that analyzed synaptic and dendritic alterations in the regions where PET imaging showed abnormal neuronal activity and network. Recording of synaptic activity also revealed that PAM reorganized synaptic distribution and decreased synaptic plasticity in hippocampus. Further study using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neuron cultures demonstrated that PAM decreased the number of presynapses and the frequency of miniature EPSCs, which suggests PAM disrupts neuronal function by damaging presynapses exclusively. We also showed that PAM caused aggregation of synapses around dendrites, which may have caused no significant change in expression level of synaptic proteins, whereas synaptic number and function were impaired by PAM. Our findings could provide a useful guide for diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders specific to bacterial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is challenging to diagnose brain disorders caused by bacterial infection because neural damage induced by bacterial products involves nonspecific neurological symptoms, which is rarely detected by laboratory tests with low spatiotemporal resolution. To better understand brain pathology, it is essential to detect functional abnormalities of brain over time. To this end, we investigated characteristic patterns of altered neuronal integrity and functional correlation between various regions in mice brains injected with bacterial lipopeptides using PET with a goal to apply new findings to diagnosis of brain disorder specific to bacterial infection. In addition, we analyzed altered synaptic density and function using both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experimental models to understand how bacterial lipopeptides impair brain function and network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhanced CRFR1-Dependent Regulation of a Ventral Tegmental Area to Prelimbic Cortex Projection Establishes Susceptibility to Stress-Induced Cocaine Seeking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10657?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10657?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability of stress to trigger cocaine seeking in humans and rodents is variable and is determined by the amount and pattern of prior drug use. This study examined the role of a corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-regulated dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the prelimbic cortex in shock-induced cocaine seeking and its recruitment under self-administration conditions that establish relapse vulnerability. Male rats with a history of daily long-access (LgA; 14 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 6 h/d) but not short-access (ShA; 14 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 2 h/d) self-administration showed robust shock-induced cocaine seeking. This was associated with a heightened shock-induced prelimbic cortex Fos response and activation of cholera toxin b retro-labeled VTA neurons that project to the prelimbic cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway using a dual virus intersectional hM4Di DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) based approach prevented shock-induced cocaine seeking. Both shock-induced reinstatement and the prelimbic cortex Fos response were prevented by bilateral intra-VTA injections of the CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) antagonist, antalarmin. Moreover, pharmacological disconnection of the CRF-regulated dopaminergic projection to the prelimbic cortex by injection of antalarmin into the VTA in one hemisphere and the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, into the prelimbic cortex of the contralateral hemisphere prevented shock-induced cocaine seeking. Finally, LgA, but not ShA, cocaine self-administration resulted in increased VTA CRFR1 mRNA levels as measured using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization. Altogether, these findings suggest that excessive cocaine use may establish susceptibility to stress-induced relapse by recruiting CRF regulation of a stressor-responsive mesocortical dopaminergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the neural pathways and mechanisms through which stress triggers relapse to cocaine use is critical for the development of more effective treatment approaches. Prior work has demonstrated a critical role for the neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in stress-induced cocaine seeking. Here we provide evidence that stress-induced reinstatement in a rat model of relapse is mediated by a CRF-regulated dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that activates dopamine D1 receptors in the prelimbic cortex. Moreover, we report that this pathway may be recruited as a result of daily cocaine self-administration under conditions of extended drug access/heightened drug intake, likely as a result of increased CRFR1 expression in the VTA, thereby promoting susceptibility to stress-induced cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Asymmetric and Distant Effects of a Unilateral Lesion of the Primary Motor Cortex on the Bilateral Supplementary Motor Areas in Adult Macaque Monkeys</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A restricted lesion of the hand area in the primary motor cortex (M1) leads to a deficit of contralesional manual dexterity, followed by an incomplete functional recovery, accompanied by plastic changes in M1 itself and in other cortical areas on both hemispheres. Using the marker SMI-32 specific to pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III and V, we investigated the impact of a focal unilateral M1 lesion (hand representation) on the rostral part (F6) and caudal part (F3) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in both hemispheres in nine adult macaque monkeys compared with four intact control monkeys. The M1 lesion induced a consistent interhemispheric asymmetry in density of SMI-32-positive neurons in F3 layer V (statistically significant in 8 of 9 lesioned monkeys), highly correlated with the lesion volume and with the duration of functional recovery, but not with the extent of functional recovery itself. Such interhemispheric asymmetry was neither present in the intact monkeys, as expected, nor in F6 in all monkeys. In addition, the M1 lesion also impacted on the basal dendritic arborization of F3 layer V neurons. Neuronal density was clearly less affected by the M1 lesion in F3 layer III compared with layer V. We interpret the remote effect of M1 lesion onto the density of SMI-32-positive neurons and dendritic arborization in the SMAs bilaterally as the consequence of multiple factors, such as changes of connectivity, diaschisis and various mechanisms involved in cortical plasticity underlying the functional recovery from the M1 lesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The motor system of macaque monkeys, in addition to be similarly organized as in humans, is a good candidate to study the impact of a focal lesion of the main contributor to voluntary movements, the primary motor cortex (M1), on non-primary motor cortical areas also involved in manual dexterity, both at behavioral and structural levels. Our results show that a unilateral permanent lesion of M1 hand area in nine monkeys affects the interhemispheric balance of the number of SMI-32-positive pyramidal neurons in the cortical layer V of the supplementary motor area, in a way strongly correlated to the lesion volume and duration of the incomplete functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CK1{alpha} Collaborates with DOUBLETIME to Regulate PERIOD Function in the Drosophila Circadian Clock</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10631?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The animal circadian timing system interprets environmental time cues and internal metabolic status to orchestrate circadian rhythms of physiology, allowing animals to perform necessary tasks in a time-of-day-dependent manner. Normal progression of circadian rhythms is dependent on the daily cycling of core transcriptional factors that make up cell-autonomous molecular oscillators. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, PERIOD (PER), TIMELESS (TIM), CLOCK (CLK), and CYCLE (CYC) are core clock proteins that function in a transcriptional–translational feedback mechanism to regulate the circadian transcriptome. Posttranslational modifications of core clock proteins provide precise temporal control over when they are active as regulators of clock-controlled genes. In particular, phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism that dictates the subcellular localization, stability, and transcriptional activity of clock proteins. Previously, casein kinase 1α (CK1α) has been identified as a kinase that phosphorylates mammalian PER1 and modulates its stability, but the mechanisms by which it modulates PER protein stability is still unclear. Using &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; as a model, we show that CK1α has an overall function of speeding up PER metabolism and is required to maintain the 24 h period of circadian rhythms. Our results indicate that CK1α collaborates with the key clock kinase DOUBLETIME (DBT) in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to regulate the timing of PER-dependent repression of the circadian transcriptome. Specifically, we observe that CK1α promotes PER nuclear localization by antagonizing the activity of DBT to inhibit PER nuclear translocation. Furthermore, CK1α enhances DBT-dependent PER phosphorylation and degradation once PER moves into the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Circadian clocks are endogenous timers that integrate environmental signals to impose temporal control over organismal physiology over the 24 h day/night cycle. To maintain the 24 h period length of circadian clocks and to ensure that circadian rhythms are in synchrony with the external environment, key proteins that make up the molecular oscillator are extensively regulated by phosphorylation to ensure that they perform proper time-of-day-specific functions. Casein kinase 1α (CK1α) has previously been identified as a kinase that phosphorylates mammalian PERIOD (PER) proteins to promote their degradation, but the mechanism by which it modulates PER stability is unclear. In this study, we characterize the mechanisms by which CK1α interacts with DOUBLETIME (DBT) to achieve the overall function of speeding up PER metabolism and to ensure proper time-keeping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nonhuman primates have proven to be a valuable animal model for exploring neuronal mechanisms of cognitive control. One important aspect of executive control is the ability to switch from one task to another, and task-switching paradigms have often been used in human volunteers to uncover the underlying neuronal processes. To date, however, no study has investigated task-switching paradigms in nonhuman primates during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We trained two rhesus macaques to switch between arm movement, eye movement, and passive fixation tasks during fMRI. Similar to results obtained in human volunteers, task switching elicits increased fMRI activations in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Our results indicate that the macaque monkey is a reliable model with which to investigate higher-order cognitive functioning such as task switching. As such, these results can pave the way for a detailed investigation of the neural basis of complex human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Task switching is an important aspect of cognitive control, and task-switching paradigms have often been used to investigate higher-order executive functioning in human volunteers. We used a task-switching paradigm in the nonhuman primate during fMRI and found increased activation mainly in prefrontal areas (46, 45, frontal eye field, and anterior cingulate), in orbitofrontal area 12, and in the caudate nucleus. These data fit surprisingly well with previous human imaging data, proving that the monkey is an excellent model to study task switching with high spatiotemporal resolution tools that are currently not applicable in humans. As such, our results pave the way for a detailed interrogation of regions performing similar executive functions in humans and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Convergent Inputs from the Hippocampus and Thalamus to the Nucleus Accumbens Regulate Dopamine Neuron Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant hippocampal activity is observed in individuals with schizophrenia and is thought to underlie the augmented dopamine system function associated with psychosis. The pathway by which the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) regulates dopamine neuron activity has been demonstrated previously and involves a glutamatergic projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Recent postmortem studies have confirmed glutamatergic abnormalities in the NAc of individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically, an increase in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) expression was reported. Although projections from the hippocampus do express vGlut2, inputs from the thalamus are more likely to account for this alteration; however, the role of thalamic inputs to the NAc in the regulation of dopamine neuron activity has not been elucidated. Here, using male Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrate that a subset of NAc medium spiny neurons receive convergent inputs from the vHipp and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), with both regions working synergistically to regulate dopamine neuron activity. Activation of either the vHipp or PVT increases the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Moreover, this regulation requires simultaneous activity in both regions because PVT inactivation can reverse vHipp-induced increases in dopamine neuron population activity and vHipp inactivation can reverse PVT-induced increases. This is relevant to schizophrenia because inactivation of either the vHipp or PVT is sufficient to reverse aberrant dopamine system function in two distinct rodent models. These data suggest that thalamic abnormalities may contribute to the aberrant dopamine system function observed in schizophrenia and that the PVT represents a novel site of intervention for psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current treatments for schizophrenia are far from adequate and a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology underlying this disease is warranted if we are to discover novel therapeutic targets. We have previously demonstrated that the aberrant dopamine system function observed in individuals with schizophrenia and rodent models is driven by increases in hippocampal activity. We now demonstrate that thalamic (paraventricular nucleus, PVT) and ventral hippocampal afferents converge in the nucleus accumbens to regulate dopamine system function. Such information provides a potential site for therapeutic intervention for schizophrenia. Indeed, inactivation of the PVT can effectively reverse aberrant dopamine system function in two distinct rodent models displaying circuit level alterations and corresponding behavioral deficits relevant to schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular Prion Protein Mediates the Disruption of Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity by Soluble Tau In Vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of tau protein are a neuropathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). For some time NFTs were considered the primary cause of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, however, more recent evidence suggests that soluble aggregates of tau are key drivers of disease. Here we investigated the effect of different tau species on synaptic plasticity in the male rat hippocampus &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Intracerebroventricular injection of soluble aggregates formed from either wild-type or P301S human recombinant tau potently inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-to-CA1 synapses. In contrast, tau monomers and fibrils appeared inactive. Neither baseline synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation nor burst response during high-frequency conditioning stimulation was affected by the soluble tau aggregates. Similarly, certain AD brain soluble extracts inhibited LTP in a tau-dependent manner that was abrogated by either immunodepletion with, or coinjection of, a mid-region anti-tau monoclonal antibody (mAb), Tau5. Importantly, this tau-mediated block of LTP was prevented by administration of mAbs selective for the prion protein (PrP). Specifically, mAbs to both the mid-region (6D11) and N-terminus (MI-0131) of PrP prevented inhibition of LTP by both recombinant and brain-derived tau. These findings indicate that PrP is a mediator of tau-induced synaptic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we report that certain soluble forms of tau selectively disrupt synaptic plasticity in the live rat hippocampus. Further, we show that monoclonal antibodies to cellular prion protein abrogate the impairment of long-term potentiation caused both by recombinant and Alzheimer's disease brain-derived soluble tau. These findings support a critical role for cellular prion protein in the deleterious synaptic actions of extracellular soluble tau in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. Thus, approaches targeting cellular prion protein, or downstream pathways, might provide an effective strategy for developing therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SFPEL-LPI: Sequence-based feature projection ensemble learning for predicting LncRNA-protein interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006616</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen Zhang, Xiang Yue, Guifeng Tang, Wenjian Wu, Feng Huang, Xining Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

LncRNA-protein interactions play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. Identification of lncRNA-protein interactions helps to understand lncRNA-related activities. Existing computational methods utilize multiple lncRNA features or multiple protein features to predict lncRNA-protein interactions, but features are not available for all lncRNAs or proteins; most of existing methods are not capable of predicting interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) for new lncRNAs (or proteins), which don’t have known interactions. In this paper, we propose the sequence-based feature projection ensemble learning method, “SFPEL-LPI”, to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. First, SFPEL-LPI extracts lncRNA sequence-based features and protein sequence-based features. Second, SFPEL-LPI calculates multiple lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and protein-protein similarities by using lncRNA sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein interactions. Then, SFPEL-LPI combines multiple similarities and multiple features with a feature projection ensemble learning frame. In computational experiments, SFPEL-LPI accurately predicts lncRNA-protein associations and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, SFPEL-LPI can be applied to new lncRNAs (or proteins). The case studies demonstrate that our method can find out novel lncRNA-protein interactions, which are confirmed by literature. Finally, we construct a user-friendly web server, available at http://www.bioinfotech.cn/SFPEL-LPI/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0iga8hXGIQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Elazar et al. demonstrate that myelination requires regulated adhesive interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons. They show that excessive axoglial contact results in mistargeting of oligodendrocytes to neuronal somata and their inability to form elongated myelin around axons.</description>

	<description>Memory exists across different time scales. Long-term memories can last a lifetime, while working memory persists for mere seconds. In between, memories that are newly formed—or recently recalled—are more vivid than latent ones. How does this happen? The act of memory recall increases the excitability of whole engram cells for about one hour. This short-term increase of engram cell excitability facilitates synaptic access to memory content in response to relevant environmental cues.</description>

About 330 CNS cells comprise mostly ciliated ependymal cells, with ∼180 neurons that constitute about 50 morphologically distinguishable types. The neurons reveal various chordate characters amid many features that are idiosyncratic. Most neurons are ciliated and lack dendrites, some even lack an axon. Synapses mostly form en passant between axons, and resemble those in basal invertebrates; some are dyads and all have heterogenous synaptic vesicle populations. Each neuron has on average 49 synapses with other cells; these constitute a synaptic network of unpredicted complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Gershman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancing exploration and exploitation is one of the central problems in reinforcement learning. We review recent studies that have identified multiple algorithmic strategies underlying exploration. In particular, humans use a combination of random and uncertainty-directed exploration strategies, which rely on different brain systems, have different developmental trajectories, and are sensitive to different task manipulations. Humans are also able to exploit sophisticated structural knowledge to aid their exploration, such as information about correlations between options. New computational models, drawing inspiration from machine learning, have begun to formalize these ideas and offer new ways to understand the neural basis of reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Eran A Mukamel, John Ngai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diversity of brain cell types was one of the earliest observations in modern neuroscience and continues to be one of the central concerns of current neuroscience research. Despite impressive recent progress, including single cell transcriptome and epigenome profiling as well as anatomical methods, we still lack a complete census or taxonomy of brain cell types. We argue this is due partly to the conceptual difficulty in defining a cell type. By considering the biological drivers of cell identity, such as networks of genes and gene regulatory elements, we propose a definition of cell type that emphasizes self-stabilizing regulation. We explore the predictions and hypotheses that arise from this definition. Integration of data from multiple modalities, including molecular profiling of genes and gene products, epigenetic landscape, cellular morphology, connectivity, and physiology, will be essential for a meaningful and broadly useful definition of brain cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Several recent reviews have comprehensively discussed the molecular and functional diversity of mammalian astrocytes. In this brief review, we emphasize interspecies comparisons and an evolutionary perspective regarding the astro(glia) of vertebrates and invertebrates which are similar in form and function. This analysis has revealed conserved astrocyte transcriptomes in the fly, mouse and human. We also offer opinions about the pattern and origin of astrocyte heterogeneity in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

New genome wide approaches have revealed that ARG programs are highly cell-type-specific, raising the possibility that they mediate different forms of experience-dependent plasticity in different cell types. The cell-type specificity of these gene programs is achieved by a combination of cell-intrinsic mechanisms that determine the transcriptional response of each neuronal subtype to a given stimulus and by cell-extrinsic mechanisms that influence the nature of the stimulus a cell receives. A better understanding of these mechanisms could usher in an era of molecular systems neuroscience in which genetic perturbations of cell-type-specific plasticities are assessed using electrophysiology and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; imaging to reveal the neural basis of adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-nociceptive roles of opioids in the CNS: opioids’ effects on neurogenesis, learning, memory and affect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-nociceptive roles of opioids in the CNS: opioids’ effects on neurogenesis, learning, memory and affect, Published online: 05 December 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-018-0092-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41583-018-0092-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Maladaptive modulation of learning, memory and affect by opioids is linked to dysfunctional neurogenesis. In this Review, Kibaly and colleagues discuss this link and how strategies that target neurogenesis to rescue opioid-dependent learning, memory and affect impairments constitute future directions for anti-addiction therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/rhSCb6p1lVQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
