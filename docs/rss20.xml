	<description>In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.</description>

	<description>By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.</description>

	<description>Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.</description>

	<description>In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantitative theory of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for the suppression of pathological rhythms in Parkinson’s disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eli J. Müller, Peter A. Robinson&lt;/p&gt;

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simulations to benchmark time-varying connectivity methods for fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006196</guid>

There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain’s dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt;, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method’s ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt; researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PcnqFhi9tsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Parameter uncertainty quantification using surrogate models applied to a spatial model of yeast mating polarization</title>

A common challenge in systems biology is quantifying the effects of unknown parameters and estimating parameter values from data. For many systems, this task is computationally intractable due to expensive model evaluations and large numbers of parameters. In this work, we investigate a new method for performing sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of complex biological models using techniques from uncertainty quantification. The primary advance is a significant improvement in computational efficiency from the replacement of model simulation by evaluation of a polynomial surrogate model. We demonstrate the method on two models of mating in budding yeast: a smaller ODE model of the heterotrimeric G-protein cycle, and a larger spatial model of pheromone-induced cell polarization. A small number of model simulations are used to fit the polynomial surrogates, which are then used to calculate global parameter sensitivities. The surrogate models also allow rapid Bayesian inference of the parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) by eliminating model simulations at each step. Application to the ODE model shows results consistent with published single-point estimates for the model and data, with the added benefit of calculating the correlations between pairs of parameters. On the larger PDE model, the surrogate models allowed convergence for the distribution of 15 parameters, which otherwise would have been computationally prohibitive using simulations at each MCMC step. We inferred parameter distributions that in certain cases peaked at values different from published values, and showed that a wide range of parameters would permit polarization in the model. Strikingly our results suggested different diffusion constants for active versus inactive Cdc42 to achieve good polarization, which is consistent with experimental observations in another yeast species &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRhq-0CxzAI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimizing the learning rate for adaptive estimation of neural encoding models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006168</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AXBHSencE5U/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Han-Lin Hsieh, Maryam M. Shanechi&lt;/p&gt;

Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time. Moreover, the calibration algorithm allows for fast and accurate learning of the encoding model and for fast convergence of decoding to accurate performance. Finally, larger learning rates result in inaccurate encoding models and decoders, and smaller learning rates delay their convergence. The calibration algorithm provides a novel analytical approach to predictably achieve a desired level of error and convergence time in adaptive learning, with application to closed-loop neurotechnologies and other signal processing domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXBHSencE5U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Detecting change in stochastic sound sequences</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Skerritt-Davis, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Our ability to parse our acoustic environment relies on the brain’s capacity to extract statistical regularities from surrounding sounds. Previous work in regularity extraction has predominantly focused on the brain’s sensitivity to predictable patterns in sound sequences. However, natural sound environments are rarely completely predictable, often containing some level of randomness, yet the brain is able to effectively interpret its surroundings by extracting useful information from stochastic sounds. It has been previously shown that the brain is sensitive to the marginal lower-order statistics of sound sequences (i.e., mean and variance). In this work, we investigate the brain’s sensitivity to higher-order statistics describing temporal dependencies between sound events through a series of change detection experiments, where listeners are asked to detect changes in randomness in the pitch of tone sequences. Behavioral data indicate listeners collect statistical estimates to process incoming sounds, and a perceptual model based on Bayesian inference shows a capacity in the brain to track higher-order statistics. Further analysis of individual subjects’ behavior indicates an important role of perceptual constraints in listeners’ ability to track these sensory statistics with high fidelity. In addition, the inference model facilitates analysis of neural electroencephalography (EEG) responses, anchoring the analysis relative to the statistics of each stochastic stimulus. This reveals both a deviance response and a change-related disruption in phase of the stimulus-locked response that follow the higher-order statistics. These results shed light on the brain’s ability to process stochastic sound sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ROlsYNEAxXQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How epigenome drives chromatin folding and dynamics, insights from efficient coarse-grained models of chromosomes</title>

The 3D organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed—topologically constrained—polymers. The main challenges are therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we develop a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YYb8ENLLah4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin filaments (&amp;lt; 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone. In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; per crosslinker). This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle, we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HugZ5m7-OgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Can a time varying external drive give rise to apparent criticality in neural systems?</title>

The finding of power law scaling in neural recordings lends support to the hypothesis of critical brain dynamics. However, power laws are not unique to critical systems and can arise from alternative mechanisms. Here, we investigate whether a common time-varying external drive to a set of Poisson units can give rise to neuronal avalanches and exhibit apparent criticality. To this end, we analytically derive the avalanche size and duration distributions, as well as additional measures, first for homogeneous Poisson activity, and then for slowly varying inhomogeneous Poisson activity. We show that homogeneous Poisson activity cannot give rise to power law distributions. Inhomogeneous activity can also not generate perfect power laws, but it can exhibit approximate power laws with cutoffs that are comparable to those typically observed in experiments. The mechanism of generating apparent criticality by time-varying external fields, forces or input may generalize to many other systems like dynamics of swarms, diseases or extinction cascades. Here, we illustrate the analytically derived effects for spike recordings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and discuss approaches to distinguish true from apparent criticality. Ultimately, this requires causal interventions, which allow separating internal system properties from externally imposed ones.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lb6BJ4HT6MU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment.

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy.

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The identification of ion channels involved in the transduction of thermal changes has provided a genetic access point to the thermal system. However, from sensory specific ‘labeled-lines’ to multimodal interactive pathways, the functional organization and identity of the neural circuits mediating innocuous thermal perception have been debated for over 100 years. Here we highlight points in the system that require further attention and review recent advances using in vivo electrophysiology, cellular resolution calcium imaging, optogenetics and thermal perceptual tasks in behaving mice that have begun to uncover the anatomical principles and neural processing mechanisms underlying innocuous thermal perception. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since mutations in human &lt;i&gt;SHANK&lt;/i&gt; genes have been found in patients with autism, genetic mouse models are employed for a mechanistic understanding of ASDs and the development of therapeutic strategies. SHANKs are scaffold proteins in the postsynaptic density of mammalian excitatory synapses with proposed functions in synaptogenesis, regulation of dendritic spine morphology, and instruction of structural synaptic plasticity. In contrast to all studies so far on the function of SHANK proteins, we have previously observed enhanced synaptic plasticity in Shank2 ex7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In a series of experiments we now reproduce these results, further explore the synaptic phenotype, and directly compare our model to the independently generated Shank2 ex6-7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Minimal stimulation experiments reveal that Shank2 ex7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice possess an excessive fraction of silent (i.e. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, short, AMPA receptor lacking) synapses. The synaptic maturation deficit emerges during the third postnatal week and constitutes a plausible mechanistic explanation for the mutants' increased capacity for long-term potentiation (LTP), both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. A direct comparison with Shank2 ex6-7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice adds weight to the hypothesis that both models show a different set of synaptic phenotypes, possibly due to differences in their genetic background. These findings add to the diversity of synaptic phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders and further support the supposed existence of &quot;modifier genes&quot; in the expression and inheritance of ASDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a global prevalence of 0.1–2%, a fraction of which is caused by mutations in human &lt;i&gt;SHANK&lt;/i&gt; genes. A number of Shank mouse models that reproduce behavioral symptoms also show reduced synaptic plasticity - which is why boosting plasticity has become one line of therapeutic rescue efforts. In contrast to all studies so far on the function of SHANK proteins, we observe enhanced plasticity in Shank2 ex7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and uncover a previously unrecognized synapse maturation deficit. This neurodevelopmental phenotype is shared among a number of mouse models for neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting synapse maturation as a field of future studies and for the exploration of therapeutic intervention. The observation of distinct and non-congruent phenotypes in genetically similar yet non-identical mouse models adds weight to the hypothesis that genetic interactions of putative &quot;modifier genes&quot; might influence the phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Mammalian TRIM67 Functions in Brain Development and Behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Class I members of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolutionarily appeared just prior to the advent of neuronal like cells and have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single class I TRIM in &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and the mammalian class I TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the guidance cue netrin, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Opitz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often intellectual disability. We find that although TRIM67 is the least studied vertebrate class I TRIM, it is the most evolutionarily conserved. Here we show that mammalian TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions during development and adulthood. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt;. While viable, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; exhibit abnormal anatomy of specific brain regions, including hypotrophy of the hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, and thinning of forebrain commissures. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice display impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function, and sensorimotor gating, whereas several other behaviors remain intact. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Class I TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in neuronal development and function, some of which occur downstream of netrin. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved of this class and is developmentally regulated and brain-enriched. Deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; results in malformations of a subset of subcortical brain regions and of cortical and subcortical myelinated fiber tracts, as well as deficits in spatial memory, motor function, sociability and sensorimotor gating. Interactions between TRIM67 and both the netrin receptor DCC and TRIM9, and abnormalities in netrin-sensitive brain regions are noted. We conclude that TRIM67 is critical for appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Control is essential to the functioning of any neural system. Indeed, under
healthy conditions the brain must be able to continuously maintain a tight
functional control between the system's inputs and outputs. One may therefore
hypothesise that the brain's wiring is predetermined by the need to maintain
control across multiple scales, maintaining the stability of key internal
variables, and producing behaviour in response to environmental cues. Recent
advances in network control have offered a powerful mathematical framework to
explore the structure-function relationship in complex biological, social, and
technological networks, and are beginning to yield important and precise
insights for neuronal systems. The network control paradigm promises a
predictive, quantitative framework to unite the distinct datasets necessary to
fully describe a nervous system, and provide mechanistic explanations for the
observed structure and function relationships. Here, we provide a thorough
review of the network control framework as applied to C. elegans, in the style
of a FAQ. We present the theoretical, computational, and experimental aspects
of network control, and discuss its current capabilities and limitations,
together with the next likely advances and improvements. We further present the
Python code to enable exploration of control principles in a manner specific to
this prototypical organism.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks have been applied very successfully in image recognition
and natural language processing. Recently these powerful methods have received
attention also in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community. Here, we
introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for
classification of brain states from non-invasive magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
measurements. The model structure is motivated by a state-of-the-art generative
model of the MEG signal and is thus readily interpretable in neurophysiological
terms. We demonstrate that the proposed model is highly accurate in decoding
event-related responses as well as modulations of oscillatory brain activity,
and is robust with respect to inter-individual differences. Importantly, the
model generalizes well across users: when trained on data pooled from previous
users, it can successfully perform on new users. Thus, the time-consuming BCI
calibration can be omitted. Moreover, the model can be incrementally updated,
resulting in +8.9% average accuracy improvement in offline experiments and
+17.0% in a real-time BCI. We argue that this model can be used in practical
BCIs and basic neuroscience research.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Discrete flow posteriors for variational inference in discrete dynamical systems. (arXiv:1805.10958v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10958</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10958</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample
from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised)
approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully
exploits GPU parallelism. However, such simple approximate posteriors are often
insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.
While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for
continuous latents, some problems have discrete latents and strong statistical
dependencies. The most natural approach to model these dependencies is an
autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently
sequential and thus slow. We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for
autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables
efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space latent
variable dynamical systems. To optimize the variational bound, we considered
two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into
the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic
latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a
normalizing flow. We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave
considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate
posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former
approach. Using our fast sampling procedure, we were able to realize the
benefits of correlated posteriors, including accurate uncertainty estimates for
one cell, and accurate connectivity estimates for multiple cells, in an order
of magnitude less time.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Using spike train distances to identify the most discriminative neuronal subpopulation. (arXiv:1805.10892v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10892</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10892</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Spike trains of multiple neurons can be analyzed following the
summed population (SP) or the labeled line (LL) hypothesis. Responses to
external stimuli are generated by a neuronal population as a whole or the
individual neurons have encoding capacities of their own. The SPIKE-distance
estimated either for a single, pooled spike train over a population or for each
neuron separately can serve to quantify these responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Method: For the SP case we compare three algorithms that search for the
most discriminative subpopulation over all stimulus pairs. For the LL case we
introduce a new algorithm that combines neurons that individually separate
different pairs of stimuli best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The best approach for SP is a brute force search over all possible
subpopulations. However, it is only feasible for small populations. For more
realistic settings, simulated annealing clearly outperforms gradient algorithms
with only a limited increase in computational load. Our novel LL approach can
handle very involved coding scenarios despite its computational ease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison with Existing Methods: Spike train distances have been extended to
the analysis of neural populations interpolating between SP and LL coding. This
includes parametrizing the importance of distinguishing spikes being fired in
different neurons. Yet, these approaches only consider the population as a
whole. The explicit focus on subpopulations render our algorithms
complimentary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The spectrum of encoding possibilities in neural populations is
broad. The SP and LL cases are two extremes for which our algorithms provide
correct identification results.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10827</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of human statistical learning is the ability to extract
temporal regularities / patterns from random sequences. Here we present a
method of computing pattern time statistics with generating functions for
first-order Markov trials and independent Bernoulli trials. We show that the
pattern time statistics cover a wide range of measurements commonly used in
existing studies of both human and machine learning of stochastic processes,
including probability of alternation, temporal correlation between pattern
events, and related variance / risk measures. Moreover, we show that recurrent
processing and event segmentation by pattern overlap may provide a coherent
explanation for the sensitivity of the human brain to the rich statistics and
the latent structures in the learning environment.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an
open question how seriously to take the analogies between artificial deep
networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown
that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image
recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the
responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that
analogies between artificial and biological neural networks may be more than
superficial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average
responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these
neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data
for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of
supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and
brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition,
neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static
inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the
visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental
differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep
networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a
previously-described recurrent generative network that is trained to predict
future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able
to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual
cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion
illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent
predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can
enrich both fields.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic neural networks are a prototypical computational device able to
build a probabilistic representation of an ensemble of external stimuli.
Building on the relation between inference and learning, we derive a synaptic
plasticity rule that relies only on delayed activity correlations, and that
shows a number of remarkable features. Our &quot;delayed-correlations matching&quot;
(DCM) rule satisfies some basic requirements for biological feasibility: finite
and noisy afferent signals, Dale's principle and asymmetry of synaptic
connections, locality of the weight update computations. Nevertheless, the DCM
rule is capable of storing a large, extensive number of patterns as attractors
in a stochastic recurrent neural network, under general scenarios without
requiring any modification: it can deal with correlated patterns, a broad range
of architectures (with or without hidden neuronal states), one-shot learning
with the palimpsest property, all the while avoiding the proliferation of
spurious attractors. When hidden units are present, our learning rule can be
employed to construct Boltzman-Machine-like generative models, exploiting the
addition of hidden neurons in feature extraction and classification tasks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Network Modeling of Short Over-Dispersed Spike-Counts: A Hierarchical Parametric Empirical Bayes Framework. (arXiv:1605.02869v3 [q-bio.QM] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate statistical models of neural spike responses can characterize the
information carried by neural populations. Yet, challenges in recording at the
level of individual neurons commonly results in relatively limited samples of
spike counts, which can lead to model overfitting. Moreover, current models
assume spike counts to be Poisson-distributed, which ignores the fact that many
neurons demonstrate over-dispersed spiking behavior. The Negative Binomial
Generalized Linear Model (NB-GLM) provides a powerful tool for modeling
over-dispersed spike counts. However, maximum likelihood based standard NB-GLM
leads to unstable and inaccurate parameter estimations. Thus, we propose a
hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes method for estimating the parameters of
the NB-GLM. Our method integrates Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and
empirical Bayes theory to: (1) effectively capture over-dispersion nature of
spike counts from retinal ganglion neural responses; (2) significantly reduce
mean square error of parameter estimations when compared to maximum likelihood
based method for NB-GLMs; (3) provide an efficient alternative to fully
Bayesian inference with low computational cost for hierarchical models; and (4)
give insightful findings on both neural interactions and spiking behaviors of
real retina cells. We apply our approach to study both simulated data and
experimental neural data from the retina. The simulation results indicate the
new framework can efficiently and accurately retrieve the weights of functional
connections among neural populations and predict mean spike counts. The results
from the retinal datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms both
standard Poisson and Negative Binomial GLMs in terms of the predictive
log-likelihood of held-out data.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Correlates of Personalized Spiritual Experiences</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Across cultures and throughout history, human beings have reported a variety of spiritual experiences and the concomitant perceived sense of union that transcends oneâ€™s ordinary sense of self. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms of spiritual experiences, particularly when examined across different traditions and practices. By adapting an individualized guided-imagery task, we investigated neural correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences as compared with stressful and neutral-relaxing experiences. We observed in the spiritual condition, as compared with the neutral-relaxing condition, reduced activity in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a result that suggests the IPL may contribute importantly to perceptual processing and self-other representations during spiritual experiences. Compared with stress cues, responses to spiritual cues showed reduced activity in the medial thalamus and caudate, regions associated with sensory and emotional processing. Overall, the study introduces a novel method for investigating brain correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences and suggests neural mechanisms associated with broadly defined and personally experienced spirituality.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An Event-related Potential Comparison of Facial Expression Processing between Cartoon and Real Faces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333898v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Faces play important roles in the social lives of humans. In addition to real faces, people also encounter numerous cartoon faces in daily life. These cartoon faces convey basic emotional states through facial expressions. Using a behavioral research methodology and event-related potentials (ERPs), we conducted a facial expression recognition experiment with 17 university students to compare the processing of cartoon faces with that of real faces. This study used face type (real vs. cartoon) and participant gender (male vs. female) as independent variables. Reaction time, recognition accuracy, and the amplitudes and latencies of emotion processing-related ERP components such as N170, vertex positive potential (VPP), and late positive potential (LPP) were used as dependent variables. The ERP results revealed that cartoon faces caused larger N170 and VPP amplitudes as well as a briefer N170 latency than did real faces; that real faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did cartoon faces; and that angry faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did happy faces. In addition, the results showed a significant difference in the brain regions associated with face processing as reflected in a right hemispheric advantage. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times for happy faces were shorter than those for angry faces; that females showed a higher facial expression recognition accuracy than did males; and that males showed a higher recognition accuracy for angry faces than happy faces. These results demonstrate differences in facial expression recognition and neurological processing between cartoon faces and real faces among adults. Cartoon faces showed a higher processing intensity and speed than real faces during the early processing stage. However, more attentional resources were allocated for real faces during the late processing stage.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The influence of prosocial priming on visual perspective taking and automatic imitation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333880v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333880v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Imitation and perspective taking are core features of non-verbal social interactions. We imitate one another to signal a desire to affiliate and consider others' points of view to better understand their perspective. Prior research suggests that a relationship exists between prosocial behaviour and imitation. For example, priming prosocial behaviours has been shown to increase imitative tendencies in automatic imitation tasks. Despite its importance during social interactions, far less is known about how perspective taking might relate to either prosociality or imitation. The current study investigates the relationship between imitation and perspective taking by testing the extent to which these skills are similarly modulated by prosocial priming. Across all experimental groups, a surprising ceiling effect emerged in the perspective taking task (the Director's Task), which prevented the investigation prosocial priming on perspective taking. A comparison of other studies using the Director's Task shows wide variability in accuracy scores across studies and is suggestive of low task reliability. In addition, despite using a high-power design, and contrary to three previous studies, no effect of prosocial prime on imitation was observed. Meta-analysing all studies to date suggests that the effects of prosocial primes on imitation are variable and could be small. The current study, therefore, offers caution when using the Director's Task as a measure of perspective taking with adult populations, as it shows high variability across studies and may suffer from a ceiling effect. In addition, the results question the size and robustness of prosocial priming effects on automatic imitation. More generally, by reporting null results we hope to minimise publication bias and by meta-analysing results as studies emerge and making data freely available, we hope to move towards a more cumulative science of social cognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inductive reasoning differs between taxonomic and thematic contexts: Electrophysiological evidence</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333211v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Inductive reasoning can be performed in different contexts, but it is unclear whether the neural mechanism of inductive reasoning performed in a thematic context (e.g., panda has x, so bamboo has x) is the same as that performed in a taxonomic context (e.g., panda has x, so bear has x). In the present study, participants were required to judge whether a conclusion was acceptable or not based on its premise, for which the taxonomic or thematic distances between premise and conclusion objects were either far or near. The ERP results indicated that the effect of reasoning context (taxonomic vs. thematic) was initially observed in the P2 component; while the distance effect (far vs. near) was observed in N400 and late components. Moreover, the distance effect on thematic-based inductive reasoning was found in the frontal and frontal-central brain regions, while the distance effect in taxonomic-based inductive reasoning conditions was found in the central-parietal and parietal regions. These results support the view that inductive reasoning is performed differently under different semantic contexts.</description>

	<description>Research of the central actions of prolactin (PRL) is virtually restricted to females, but this hormone has also documented roles in male physiology and behaviour. Here, we provide the first description of the pattern of PRL-derived signalling in the male mouse brain, employing the immunostaining of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) after exogenous PRL administration. Next, we explore possible sexual dimorphism by comparing pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in PRL-supplemented males and females. We also assess the role of testosterone in the regulation of central prolactin signalling in males by comparing intact with castrated PRL-supplemented males. Prolactin-supplemented males displayed a widespread pattern of pSTAT5 immunoreactivity, restricted to brain centres showing expression of the PRL receptor. Immunoreactivity for pSTAT5 was present in several nuclei of the preoptic, anterior and tuberal hypothalamus, as well as in the septofimbrial nucleus or posterodorsal medial amygdala of the telencephalon. Conversely, non-supplemented control males were virtually devoid of pSTAT5-immunoreactivity, suggesting that central PRL actions in males are limited to situations concurrent with substantial hypophyseal PRL release (e.g. stress or mating). Furthermore, comparison of PRL-supplemented males and females revealed a significant, female-biased sexual dimorphism, supporting the view that PRL has a preeminent role in female physiology and behaviour. Finally, in males, castration significantly reduced pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in some structures, including the paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the septofimbrial region, thus indicating a region-specific regulatory role of testosterone over central PRL signalling.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333112v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Saccadic eye movements, which dramatically alter retinal images, are associated with robust peri-movement perceptual alterations. Such alterations, thought to reflect brain mechanisms for maintaining perceptual stability in the face of saccade-induced retinal-image disruptions, are often studied by asking subjects to localize brief stimuli presented around the time of horizontal saccades. However, other saccade directions are not usually explored. Motivated by recently discovered asymmetries in upper and lower visual field representations in the superior colliculus, a structure important for both saccade generation and visual analysis, here we observed significant differences in peri-saccadic perceptual alterations for upward saccades relative to other saccade directions. We also found that, even for purely horizontal saccades, perceptual alterations differ for upper versus lower retinotopic stimulus locations. Our results, coupled with conceptual modeling, suggest that peri-saccadic perceptual alterations might critically depend on neural circuits, like superior colliculus, that asymmetrically represent the upper and lower visual fields.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333104v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Common genetic variation contributes a substantial proportion of risk for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, there is evidence of significant, but not complete, overlap in genetic risk between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has been hypothesised that genetic variants conferring risk for these disorders do so by influencing brain development, leading to the later emergence of symptoms. The comparative profile of risk gene expression for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder across development over different brain regions however remains unclear. Using genotypes derived from genome wide associations studies of the largest available cohorts of patients and control subjects, we investigated whether genes enriched for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder association show a bias for expression across any of 13 developmental stages in prefrontal cortical and subcortical brain regions. We show that genes associated with schizophrenia have a strong bias towards increased expression in the prefrontal cortex during early midfetal development and early infancy, and decreased expression during late childhood which normalises in adolescence. Risk-associated genes for bipolar disorder shared this postnatal expression profile but did not exhibit a bias towards expression at any prenatal stage. These results emphasise the dynamic expression of genes harbouring risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder across prefrontal cortex development and support the view that prenatal neurodevelopmental events are more strongly associated with schizophrenia than bipolar disorder.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Meta-analysis of Reward Processing in Major Depressive Disorder: Distinct Abnormalities within the Reward Circuit?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332981v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332981v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Many neuroimaging studies have investigated reward processing dysfunction in major depressive disorder (MDD). These studies have led to the common idea that MDD is associated with blunted responses within the reward circuit, particularly in the ventral striatum (VS). Yet, the link between MDD and aberrant responses to reward in other brain regions remains inconclusive, thus limiting our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD. Methods: We performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 46 neuroimaging studies encompassing reward-related responses from a total of 915 patients with MDD and 917 healthy controls (HCs). We only included studies that reported whole-brain results and isolated reward-related processes using an active control condition. Results: Consistent with the common notion that MDD is characterized by blunted responses to reward, we found that experiments reporting blunted responses for reward in MDD relative to HCs converged in the bilateral VS. In contrast, we found significant convergence among experiments reporting elevated responses for reward in MDD in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We also found that experiments obtaining greater responses to punishment in MDD converged in the left sublenticular extended amygdala. Conclusions: Our meta-analytic findings argue against the idea that MDD is linked to a monolithic deficit within the reward system. Instead, our results demonstrate that MDD is associated with opposing abnormalities in the reward circuit: hypo-responses in the VS and hyper-responses in the OFC. These findings help to reconceptualize our understanding of reward-processing abnormalities in MDD, potentially suggesting a role for dysregulated corticostriatal connectivity.</description>

	<description>The creation of new neurons in adulthood has potential for treating a number of disorders that are characterized by neurodegeneration or impaired plasticity. Animal models of reduced neurogenesis, and studies of the volume and structural integrity of the hippocampus in humans, suggest a possible therapeutic role for adult neurogenesis in age-related cognitive decline, depression, and schizophrenia. Research over the past 20 years has identified a number of approaches for enhancing adult neurogenesis, such as exercise, NMDA receptor antagonists, antidepressant drugs and environmental enrichment. However, despite the chronic nature of many disorders that impact the human hippocampus, most animal studies have only examined the efficacy of neurogenic treatments over relatively short timescales (~1 month or less). Additionally, investigations into the regulation of neurogenesis typically include only 1 sex, even though many disorders that affect the hippocampus differentially impact males and females. Here, we therefore tested whether two known pro-neurogenic treatments, running and the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, could lead to long-term increases in neurogenesis in male and female rats. We found that continuous access to a running wheel (cRUN) initially increased neurogenesis in both sexes, but effects were minimal after 1 month (both sexes) and completely absent after 5 months (males). Similarly, a single injection of memantine (sMEM) only transiently increased adult neurogenesis in both males and females. To determine whether extended increases in neurogenesis were possible with 2 months of RUN and MEM treatments, we subjected rats to interval running (iRUN), weekly memantine injections (mMEM), or combined treatments (iRUN-mMEM, mMEM-iRUN). We found that 2 months of iRUN increased DCX+ cell density in females but iRUN-mMEM treatment increased DCX+ cell density in males. However, analyses with thymidine analogs revealed that neurogenesis was minimally increased during the initial phases of the 2 month treatments. Collectively, our findings identify sex differences in the efficacy of neurogenic manipulations, which may be relevant for designing plasticity-promoting treatments that target the hippocampus.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331900v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331900v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Preplate is a transient layer critical for cortex development. Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are the major cell type that later restrict to layer 1 and play important role in organizing cortical layering architecture. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of preplate and CR cell differentiation remain poorly understood. Results: We used Ebf2-EGFP transgenic mouse that labeled preplate first then persisted to CR, to purify Ebf2 positive cells at different early embryonic stages. Bioinformatic analysis of high throughput RNA-seq revealed differentially expressed genes profile in Ebf2+ and Ebf2- cell population and temporal gene expression dynamics during early neurogenesis and CR neuron specification. Furthermore, our single cell RNA-seq unraveled E15.5 CR cells could be classified into three subpopulations based on their mature states. We also found that the upstream regulatory regions of Ebf2+ cell-enriched genes and lncRNAs were associated with active histone modifications by ChIP-seq studies, indicating epigenetic involvements in early differentiating neuron gene expression. Combined with functional prediction analysis, we identified a number of coding genes and lncRNAs that might regulate different aspects of CR neuron differentiation via primary cell culture, wholemount culture and In Utero Electroporation layer 1 assays. Conclusions: Our work has identified genes and provided histone modification atlas that are related to early neurogenesis, particularly CR neuron identity, and will help understand the molecular mechanisms governing the developmental function of CR neurons.

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex non-linear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong-Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Individualized medicine is increasingly put forward as an important means to advance medical care. In this regard, the neuroinformatics platform &quot;The Virtual Brain&quot; holds great promise, given its direct focus on simulation of subject-specific brain activity. Reliable prediction of patient-specific large-scale brain dynamics would open up the possibility to virtually lesion structural connectomes, making computational models unique predictive tools to investigate the impact of diverse structural connectivity alterations on brain functioning, including those purposefully induced by surgery. Results of this study establish the basis for this purpose, by demonstrating individual specificity of biophysical model parameters, differences in local model parameters dependent on distance from a tumor, and associations between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-month-old) F344xBN rats generally don’t show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8, but generally less than 14 days after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-month-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 hours. We previously demonstrated that theta burst-evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) – a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity – is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 days after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) – the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP – are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Not all cognitive decline is gradual. Older individuals – even those previously healthy and high functioning – are more likely to experience an abrupt decline in mental function (termed delirium) after immune challenge. Even if this is temporary, it is associated with increased risk of ultimately developing dementia. Although clinically important, this phenomenon is much less studied than gradual senescence and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Here we use a naturalistic rodent model to further test the hypothesis that the combination of age and an immune challenge may trigger an exaggerated inflammatory state in the brain, which in turn, disrupts molecular systems critical for memory. These studies may provide mechanistic insights into the earliest stages of inflammation-driven failures of memory-related synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic and acute implants of multi-electrode arrays that cover several
mm$^2$ of neural tissue provide simultaneous access to population signals like
extracellular potentials and the spiking activity of 100 or more individual
neurons. While the recorded data may uncover principles of brain function, its
interpretation calls for multiscale computational models with corresponding
spatial dimensions and signal predictions. Such models can facilitate the
search of mechanisms underlying observed spatiotemporal activity patterns in
cortex. Multi-layer spiking neuron network models of local cortical circuits
covering ~1 mm$^2$ have been developed, integrating experimentally obtained
neuron-type specific connectivity data and reproducing features of in-vivo
spiking statistics. With forward models, local field potentials (LFPs) can be
computed from the simulated spiking activity. To account for the spatial scale
of common neural recordings, we extend a local network and LFP model to 4x4
mm$^2$. The upscaling preserves the neuron densities, and introduces
distance-dependent connection probabilities and delays. As detailed
experimental connectivity data is partially lacking, we address this
uncertainty in model parameters by testing parameter combinations within
biologically plausible bounds. Based on model predictions of spiking activity
and LFPs, we find that the upscaling procedure preserves the overall spiking
statistics of the original model and reproduces asynchronous irregular spiking
across populations and weak pairwise spike-train correlations observed in
sensory cortex. In contrast with the weak spike-train correlations, the
correlation of LFP signals is strong and distance-dependent, compatible with
experimental observations. Enhanced spatial coherence in the low-gamma band may
explain the recent experimental report of an apparent band-pass filter effect
in the spatial reach of the LFP.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Consolidation of synaptic changes in response to neural activity is thought
to be fundamental for memory maintenance over a timescale of hours. In
experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeatedly stimulating
presynaptic neurons. However, the effectiveness of such protocols depends
crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations and the mechanisms
that cause this complex dependence are unknown. Here we propose a simple
mathematical model that allows us to systematically study the interaction
between the stimulation protocol and synaptic consolidation. We show the
existence of optimal stimulation protocols for our model and, similarly to LTP
experiments, the repetition frequency of the stimulation plays a crucial role
in achieving consolidation. Our results show that the complex dependence of LTP
on the stimulation frequency emerges naturally from a model which satisfies
only minimal bistability requirements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that disruptions of the posteromedial cortex (PMC) and
posteromedial corticothalamic connectivity contribute to disorders of
consciousness (DOCs). While most previous studies treated the PMC as a whole,
this structure is functionally heterogeneous. The present study investigated
whether particular subdivisions of the PMC are specifically associated with
DOCs. Participants were DOC patients, 21 vegetative state/unresponsive
wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), 12 minimally conscious state (MCS), and 29
healthy controls. Individual PMC and thalamus were divided into distinct
subdivisions by their fiber tractograpy to each other and default mode regions,
and white matter integrity and brain activity between/within subdivisions were
assessed. The thalamus was represented mainly in the dorsal and posterior
portions of the PMC, and the white matter tracts connecting these subdivisions
to the thalamus had less integrity in VS/UWS patients than in MCS patients and
healthy controls, as well as in patients who did not recover after 12 months
than in patients who did. The structural substrates were validated by finding
impaired functional fluctuations within this PMC subdivision. This study is the
first to show that tracts from dorsal and posterior subdivisions of the PMC to
the thalamus contribute to DOCs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many real-world data sets, especially in biology, are produced by highly
multivariate and nonlinear complex dynamical systems. In this paper, we focus
on brain imaging data, including both calcium imaging and functional MRI data.
Standard vector-autoregressive models are limited by their linearity
assumptions, while nonlinear general-purpose, large-scale temporal models, such
as LSTM networks, typically require large amounts of training data, not always
readily available in biological applications; furthermore, such models have
limited interpretability. We introduce here a novel approach for learning a
nonlinear differential equation model aimed at capturing brain dynamics.
Specifically, we propose a variable-projection optimization approach to
estimate the parameters of the multivariate (coupled) van der Pol oscillator,
and demonstrate that such a model can accurately represent nonlinear dynamics
of the brain data. Furthermore, in order to improve the predictive accuracy
when forecasting future brain-activity time series, we use this analytical
model as an unlimited source of simulated data for pretraining LSTM; such
model-specific data augmentation approach consistently improves LSTM
performance on both calcium and fMRI imaging data.

	<description>Multiple factors, including physical changes of the nasal mucosa and epithelium and exposure to air-borne environmental agents, appear to contribute to age-related olfactory loss. However, the molecular aspects of aging-associated olfactory loss in humans are not well understood. Although inflammation can be a significant underlying cause for olfactory impairment, whether aging increases the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the human olfactory mucosa and whether any inflammatory markers are associated with age-related olfactory loss remain unclear. Using a noninvasive method for collecting human olfactory mucus, we characterized and compared inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and some growth factors, in the mucus collected from the olfactory cleft or the anterior nasal cavity from 12 healthy, young (18-40 years old) and 12 elderly (60-85 years old) individuals. We also hoped to identify candidate molecular biomarkers associated with age-associated olfactory loss in humans. Olfactory thresholds were obtained for two odorants and individual mucus samples were analyzed using multiplex assays for the levels of 30 cytokines. Results indicated elevated levels of certain inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, MCP-1) in olfactory mucus of the elderly, and high levels of some inflammatory factors (MCP-1, IL-8, IL-13 and VEGF) were associated with reduced olfactory sensitivity, suggesting that inflammation may play a role in olfactory decline associated with aging.</description>

	<description>Sensory data about most natural task-relevant variables are confounded by task-irrelevant sensory variations, called nuisance variables. To be useful, the sensory signals that encode the relevant variables must be untangled from the nuisance variables through nonlinear transformations, before the brain can use or decode them to drive behaviors. The information to be untangled is represented in the cortex by the activity of large populations of neurons, constituting a nonlinear population code. Here we provide a new way of thinking about nonlinear population codes and nuisance variables, leading to a theory of nonlinear feedforward decoding of neural population activity. This theory obeys fundamental mathematical limitations on information content that are inherited from the sensory periphery, producing redundant codes when there are many more cortical neurons than primary sensory neurons. The theory predicts a simple, easily computed quantitative relationship between fluctuating neural activity and behavioral choices if the brain uses its nonlinear population codes optimally: more informative patterns should be more correlated with choices.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Abnormal microstructural development of the cerebral cortex in neonates with congenital heart disease is associated with impaired cerebral oxygen delivery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332247v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332247v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Abnormal macrostructural development of the cerebral cortex has been associated with hypoxia in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Animal studies have suggested that hypoxia results in cortical dysmaturation at the cellular level. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques offer the potential to investigate the relationship between cerebral oxygen delivery and microstructural development of the cortex in newborn infants with CHD. Methods: We measured macrostructural and microstructural properties of the cortex in 48 newborn infants with complex CHD and 48 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical volume and gyrification index were calculated from high resolution structural MRI. Neurite density and orientation dispersion indices were modelled using high angular resolution diffusion MRI. Cerebral oxygen delivery was estimated in infants with CHD using phase contrast MRI and pre-ductal pulse oximetry. We used tract-based spatial statistics to examine voxel-wise group differences in cortical microstructure. Results: Microstructural development of the cortex was abnormal in 48 infants with CHD, with regions of increased fractional anisotropy (FA) and reduced orientation dispersion index (ODI) compared to 48 healthy controls, correcting for gestational age at birth and scan (FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons at P&amp;lt;0.05). Regions of reduced cortical ODI in infants with CHD were related to impaired cerebral oxygen delivery (R2=0.637, n=39). Cortical ODI was associated with gyrification index (R2=0.589, P&amp;lt;0.0001, n=48). Conclusions: This study suggests that the primary component of cerebral cortex dysmaturation in CHD is impaired dendritic arborisation, which may underlie abnormal macrostructural findings reported in this population. The degree of impairment was related to cerebral oxygen delivery, supporting the hypothesis that maternal oxygen therapy may be beneficial in this population.</description>

	<description>Conversation is an important and ubiquitous social behavior. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (autism) without intellectual disability often have normal language abilities but deficits in social aspects of verbal interaction like pragmatics, prosody, and eye contact. Previous studies of resting state activity suggest that intrinsic connections among neural circuits involved with social processing are disrupted in autism, but to date no neuroimaging study has examined neural activity during the most commonplace yet challenging social task: spontaneous conversation. Here we used functional MRI to scan autistic males (N=19) without intellectual disability and age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (N=20) while they engaged in a total of 193 face-to-face interactions. Participants completed two kinds of tasks: Conversation, which had high social demand, and Repetition, which had low social demand. Autistic individuals showed abnormally increased task-driven inter-regional temporal correlation relative to controls, especially among social processing regions and during high social demand. Furthermore, these increased correlations were associated with more severe autism symptoms. These results were then compared with previously-acquired resting-state data (56 Autism, 62 Control participants). While some inter-regional correlation levels varied by task or rest context, others were strikingly similar across both task and rest, namely increased correlation among the thalamus, dorsal and ventral striatum, somatomotor, temporal and prefrontal cortex in the autistic individuals, relative to the control groups. These results suggest a basic distinction. Autistic cortico-cortical interactions vary by context, tending to increase relative to controls during Task and decrease during Rest. In contrast, striato- and thalamocortical relationships with socially engaged brain regions are increased in both Task and Rest, and may be core to the condition of autism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Asymmetrical interference between number and item size perception provide evidence for a domain specific impairment in dyscalculia</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332155v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Dyscalculia, a specific learning disability that impacts arithmetical skills, has previously been associated to a deficit in the precision of the system that estimates the approximate number of objects in visual scenes (the so called 'number sense' system). However, because in tasks involving numerosity comparisons dyscalculics' judgements appears disproportionally affected by continuous quantitative dimensions (such as the size of the items), an alternative view linked dyscalculia to a domain-general difficulty in inhibiting task-irrelevant responses. To arbitrate between these views, we evaluated the degree of reciprocal interference between numerical and non-numerical quantitative dimensions in adult dyscalculics and matched controls. We used a novel stimulus set orthogonally varying in mean item size and numerosity, putting particular attention into matching both features' perceptual discriminability. Participants compared those stimuli based on each of the two dimensions. While control subjects showed no significant size interference when judging numerosity, dyscalculics' numerosity judgments were strongly biased by the unattended size dimension. Importantly however, both groups showed the same degree of interference from number when judging mean size. Moreover, only the ability to discard the irrelevant size information when comparing numerosity (but not the reverse) significantly predicted calculation ability across subjects. Overall, our results show that numerosity discrimination is less prone to interference than discrimination of another quantitative feature (mean item size) when the perceptual discriminability of these features is matched, as here in control subjects. By quantifying, for the first time, dyscalculic subjects' degree of interference on another orthogonal dimension of the same stimuli, we are able to exclude a domain-general inhibition deficit as explanation for their poor / biased numerical judgement. We suggest that enhanced reliance on non-numerical cues during numerosity discrimination can represent a strategy to cope with a less precise number sense.</description>

	<description>For decades, the search for drivers of memory decline in human cognitive aging has focused on neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and dopaminergic neuromodulation. Recent findings indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC) and noradrenergic neuromodulation may also play an important role in shaping memory development in later life. However, technical challenges in non-invasive monitoring of LC integrity have hindered the study of LC-cognition associations in humans so far. Using high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, we found that individual differences in learning and memory were positively associated with LC integrity across a variety of memory tasks in large samples of younger (n = 66), and older adults (n = 233). Moreover, we observed spatially confined and functionally relevant age differences in rostral LC. Older adults who showed a more youth-like rostral LC also showed higher memory performance. These findings link non-invasive, in vivo indices of LC integrity to memory in human aging and extend our knowledge about the role of the LC norepinephrine system in senescent decline in human cognition.</description>

	<description>Before primary motor cortex (M1) develops its motor functions, it behaves like a somatosensory area. Here, by recording from neurons in the forelimb representation of M1 in postnatal day (P) 8-12 rats, we demonstrate a rapid change in the types of movements that trigger sensory responses. At P8-10, M1 neurons respond overwhelmingly to sleep-related twitches of the forelimb, but the same neurons do not respond to forelimb movements when the animal is awake. Then, only two days later, M1 neurons suddenly respond to feedback from wake movements; this transition results from a change in sensory gating by the external cuneate nucleus. Also, at P12, the onset of local cortical inhibition leads to fewer M1 neurons responding to twitches; pharmacological disinhibition unmasks the more robust twitch responsiveness observed at P8. Thus, M1 initially establishes a somatosensory framework that lays a foundation for later-emerging motor control and plasticity.</description>

	<description>Nitric oxide (NO) triggers escape reactions in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG), a core structure mediating panic-associated responses, and decreases the release of BDNF in vitro. BDNF mediates the panicolytic effect induced by antidepressant drugs and produces these effects per se when injected into the dPAG. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors would have panicolytic properties associated with increased BDNF signaling in the dPAG. We observed that the repeated (7 days), but not acute (1day), systemic administration of the NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AMG; 15 mg/kg/day) increased the latency to escape from the open arm of the elevated T-maze (ETM) and inhibited the number of jumps in hypoxia-induced escape reaction in rats, suggesting a panicolytic-like effect. Repeated, but not acute, AMG administration (15mg/kg) also decreased nitrite levels and increased TRKB phosphorylation at residues Y706/7 in the dPAG. Notwithstanding the lack of AMG effect on total BDNF levels in that structure, the microinjection of the TRK antagonist K252a into the dPAG blocked the anti-escape effect of this drug in the ETM. Taken together our data suggest that the inhibition of NO production by AMG increased the levels of pTRKB, which is required for the panicolytic-like effect observed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Temporal alignment and latent Gaussian process factor inference in population spike trains</title>

	<description>We introduce a novel scalable approach to identifying common latent structure in neural population spike-trains, which allows for variability both in the trajectory and in the rate of progression of the underlying computation. Our approach is based on shared latent Gaussian processes (GPs) which are combined linearly, as in the Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) algorithm. We extend GPFA to handle unbinned spike-train data by incorporating a continuous time point-process likelihood model, achieving scalability with a sparse variational approximation. Shared variability is separated into terms that express condition dependence, as well as trial-to-trial variation in trajectories. Finally, we introduce a nested GP formulation to capture variability in the rate of evolution along the trajectory. We show that the new method learns to recover latent trajectories in synthetic data, and can accurately identify the trial-to-trial timing of movement-related parameters from motor cortical data without any supervision.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Necroptosis and apoptosis contribute to cisplatin and aminoglycoside ototoxicity</title>

	<description>Ototoxic side effects of cisplatin and aminoglycosides have been extensively studied, but no therapy is available to date. Sensory hair cells, upon exposure to cisplatin or aminoglycosides, undergo apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Blocking these cell death pathways has therapeutic potential in theory, but incomplete protection and lack of therapeutic targets in the case of necrosis, has hampered the development of clinically applicable drugs. Over the past decade, a novel form of necrosis, termed necroptosis, was established as an alternative cell death pathway. Necroptosis is distinguished from passive necrotic cell death, in that it follows a cellular program, involving the receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and 3). In this study, we used pharmacological and genetic intervention to test the relative contributions of necroptosis and caspase-8-mediated apoptosis towards cisplatin and aminoglycoside ototoxicity. We find that ex vivo, only apoptosis contributes to cisplatin and aminoglycoside ototoxicity, while in vivo, both necroptosis and apoptosis are involved. Inhibition of necroptosis and apoptosis using pharmacological compounds is thus a viable strategy to ameliorate aminoglycoside and cisplatin ototoxicity.</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Action and perception are tightly coupled systems requiring coordination and synchronization over time. How the brain achieves synchronization is still a matter of debate, but recent experiments suggest that brain oscillations may play an important role in this process. Brain oscillations have been also proposed to be fundamental in determining time perception. Here, we had subjects perform an audiovisual temporal order judgment task to investigate the fine dynamics of temporal bias and sensitivity before and after the execution of voluntary hand movement (button-press). The reported order of the audiovisual sequence was rhythmically biased as a function of delay from hand action execution. Importantly, we found that it oscillated at a theta range frequency, starting ~500 ms before and persisting ~250 ms after the button-press, with consistent phase-locking across participants. Our results show that the perception of cross-sensory simultaneity oscillates rhythmically in synchrony with the programming phase of a voluntary action, demonstrating a link between action preparation and bias in temporal perceptual judgments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Serotonin Selectively Increases Detectability of Motion Stimuli in the Electrosensory System</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic innervation of sensory areas is found ubiquitously across the central nervous system of vertebrates. Here, we used a system’s level approach to investigate the role of serotonin on processing motion stimuli in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;. We found that exogenous serotonin application increased the firing activity of pyramidal neural responses to both looming and receding motion. Separating spikes belonging to bursts from those that were isolated revealed that this effect was primarily due to increased burst firing. Moreover, when investigating whether firing activity during stimulation could be discriminated from baseline (i.e., in the absence of stimulation), we found that serotonin increased stimulus discriminability only for some stimuli. This is because increased burst firing was most prominent for these. Further, the effects of serotonin were highly heterogeneous, with some neurons displaying large while others instead displaying minimal changes in responsiveness following serotonin application. Further analysis revealed that serotonin application had the greatest effect on neurons with low baseline firing rates and little to no effect on neurons with high baseline firing rates. Finally, the effects of serotonin on sensory neuron responses were largely independent of object velocity. Our results therefore reveal a novel function for the serotonergic system in selectively enhancing discriminability for motion stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is extensive evidence that biological neural networks encode
information in the precise timing of the spikes generated and transmitted by
neurons, which offers several advantages over rate-based codes. Here we adopt a
vector space formulation of spike train sequences and introduce a new liquid
state machine (LSM) network architecture and a new forward orthogonal
regression algorithm to learn an input-output signal mapping or to decode the
brain activity. The proposed algorithm uses precise spike timing to select the
presynaptic neurons relevant to each learning task. We show that using precise
spike timing to train the LSM and selecting the readout neurons leads to a
significant increase in performance on binary classification tasks as well as
in decoding neural activity from multielectrode array recordings, compared with
what is achieved using the standard architecture and training method.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamics of dynamics: following the formation of a line attractor. (arXiv:1805.09603v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09603</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09603</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trained recurrent neural networks are commonly used both in neuroscience and
in machine learning. Recently, several attempts were made to understand the
dynamics of such trained networks. Understanding how these dynamics arise
through learning, however, is an uncharted territory. Here, we study this
process in a simple setting -- learning to memorize analog values, leading to
the formation of a line attractor. We show that problems associated with
sequential learning of different tasks also occur in this setting.
Specifically, catastrophic forgetting dramatically hinders a local learning
rule from converging. In contrast, we show that the FORCE algorithm avoids this
issue, and analyze the underlying causes. Using these insights, we suggest
steps towards a more biologically plausible version of FORCE, as well as an
approach to design optimal training protocols.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although advanced paternal and maternal age at birth (PA/MA) increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. To explore the neuroanatomical correlates of advanced PA/MA, the current study conducted brain morphometric analyses in 39 high-functioning adult males with ASD and 39 age-, intellectual level-, and parental socioeconomic background-matched, typically developed (TD) males. Whole-brain analysis revealed that the regional gray matter volume (GMV) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (PCU) were significantly smaller in the individuals with ASD than in TD subjects (false discovery rate-corrected &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014). Additional analyses of the constituents of GMV reduction in these brain regions revealed that the cortical thickness of the right ventral PCC was significantly thinner (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014) and the surface area of bilateral PCU was significantly smaller (left: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.001; right: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.049) in the adults with ASD, compared with TD subjects. Although the analyses were exploratory, the thinner cortical thickness of right ventral PCC was significantly correlated with older PA in the ASD individuals (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.028). The current findings shed new light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the link between advanced PA and ASD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Recent years have seen a flourishing literature on detection of circulating autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These studies have generated hope for a better understanding of the underlying molecular dysfunctions and for appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, the detection of these autoantibodies in healthy subjects, and the lack of mechanistic insights have fostered debate about the pathogenic role of such autoantibodies. Here, we specifically discuss the biological evidence linking autoantibodies directed against the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR-Abs) and psychosis, emphasising recent single-molecule imaging investigations that unveiled the impaired surface trafficking of NMDAR in the presence of NMDAR-Abs from psychotic patients.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Published estimates of group differences in multisensory integration are inflated</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331702v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331702v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A common measure of multisensory integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent auditory and visual speech are integrated to produce an entirely different percept. Published studies report that participants who differ in age, gender, culture, native language, or traits related to neurological or psychiatric disorders also differ in their susceptibility to the McGurk effect. These group-level differences are used as evidence for fundamental alterations in sensory processing between populations. However, there is high variability in the McGurk effect within groups: some participants never report the illusion while others always do. High within-group variability means that sample sizes much larger than those in the published literature are necessary to accurately estimate between-group differences. Using empirical data and simulations, we show that a typical study with a sample size of 15 participants per group and a true group difference of 10% will report a group difference of 31%, an effect inflation of three-fold. Reducing the effect inflation by half requires increasing the sample size ten-fold, to 150 participants per group. The combination of within-group variability and small sizes explains two prominent features of the McGurk literature. First, group differences are inflated and highly variable across studies. Second, follow-up studies fail to replicate published reports of large between-group susceptibility differences because initial effect-size estimates are driven by statistical inflation rather than true group differences. These replication failures are especially problematic in studies of clinical populations because they have real-world consequences. Due to the high within-group variability, caution is essential when using the McGurk effect to assess deficits in clinical groups or propose treatment plans, such as training to improve sensory processing.</description>

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Brain stimulation can modulate the activity of neural circuits impaired by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), having promising clinical benefit. However, all individuals with the same condition currently receive identical brain stimulation, with limited theoretical basis for this generic approach. In this study, we introduce a control theory framework for obtaining exogenous signals that revert pathological electroencephalographic activity in AD at a minimal energetic cost, while reflecting patients’ biological variability. We used anatomical networks obtained from diffusion magnetic resonance images acquired by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as mediators for the interaction between Duffing oscillators. The nonlinear nature of the brain dynamics is preserved, given that we extend the so-called state-dependent Riccati equation control to reflect the stimulation objective in the high-dimensional neural system. By considering nonlinearities in our model, we identified regions for which control inputs fail to correct abnormal activity. There are changes to the way stimulated regions are ranked in terms of the energetic cost of controlling the entire network, from a linear to a nonlinear approach. We also found that limbic system and basal ganglia structures constitute the top target locations for stimulation in AD. Patients with highly integrated anatomical networks–namely, networks having low average shortest path length, high global efficiency–are the most suitable candidates for the propagation of stimuli and consequent success on the control task. Other diseases associated with alterations in brain dynamics and the self-control mechanisms of the brain can be addressed through our framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O4eVK9xR6I0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies have shown that non-conscious stimuli and representations
influence information processing during conscious experience. In the light of
such evidence, questions about potential functional links between non-conscious
brain representations and conscious experience arise. This article discusses a
neural coding model capable of explaining how statistical learning mechanisms
in dedicated resonant circuits could generate specific temporal activity traces
of non-conscious representations in the brain. How reentrant signaling,
top-down matching, and statistical coincidence of such activity traces may lead
to the progressive consolidation of temporal patterns that constitute the
neural signatures of conscious experience in networks extending across large
distances beyond functionally specialized brain regions is then explained.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Detection of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation using Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1805.09133v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09133</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09133</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of cardiac arrhythmia, is
difficult since many cases of AF are usually clinically silent and undiagnosed.
In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a
higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention
based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a
sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording
windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep
convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then
presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer
for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter
Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the
University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on
the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also
demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the
learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another
(photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high
accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential
applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09084</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present work shows that the maximum-entropy method can be applied to a
sample of neuronal recordings along two different routes: (1) apply to the
sample; or (2) apply to a larger, unsampled neuronal population from which the
sample is drawn, and then marginalize to the sample. These two routes give
inequivalent results. The second route can be further generalized to the case
where the size of the larger population is unknown. Which route should be
chosen? Some arguments are presented in favour of the second. This work also
presents and discusses probability formulae that relate states of knowledge
about a population and its samples, and that may be useful for sampling
problems in neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A central problem to understanding intelligence is the concept of
generalisation. This allows previously learnt structure to be exploited to
solve tasks in novel situations differing in their particularities. We take
inspiration from neuroscience, specifically the Hippocampal-Entorhinal system
(containing place and grid cells), known to be important for generalisation. We
propose that to generalise structural knowledge, the representations of the
structure of the world, i.e. how entities in the world relate to each other,
need to be separated from representations of the entities themselves. We show,
under these principles, artificial neural networks embedded with hierarchy and
fast Hebbian memory, can learn the statistics of memories, generalise
structural knowledge, and also exhibit neuronal representations mirroring those
found in the brain. We experimentally support model assumptions, showing a
preserved relationship between grid and place cells across environments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In neural network, synaptic strength could be seen as probability to transmit
impulse, and function could exist from transmission probability to synaptic
strength. If the function satisfies constraint such as continuity and
monotonicity, neural network would always go to one unique fixed point. An
biological image classifier is proposed to utilize this fixed point.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08889</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08889</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic architectures achieve low-power operation by using many simple
spiking neurons in lieu of traditional hardware. Here, we develop methods for
precise linear computations in spiking neural networks and use these methods to
map the evolution of a linear dynamical system (LDS) onto an existing
neuromorphic chip: IBM's TrueNorth. We analytically characterize, and
numerically validate, the discrepancy between the spiking LDS state sequence
and that of its non-spiking counterpart. These analytical results shed light on
the multiway tradeoff between time, space, energy, and accuracy in neuromorphic
computation. To demonstrate the utility of our work, we implemented a
neuromorphic Kalman filter (KF) and used it for offline decoding of human vocal
pitch from neural data. The neuromorphic KF could be used for low-power
filtering in domains beyond neuroscience, such as navigation or robotics.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Anatomical Connectivity Patterns Differentiate Subdivisions of the Nonlemniscal Auditory Thalamus in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Systematic examination of the inputs and outputs of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus will facilitate the functional elucidation of this complex structure in the central auditory system. In mice, comprehensive tracing studies that reveal the long-range connectivity of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus are lacking. To this end, we used Cre-inducible anterograde and monosynaptic retrograde viruses in Calbindin-2A-dgCre-D and Calretinin-IRES-Cre mice, focusing on the differences across subdivisions of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus. We found that, 1) the dorsal and medial parts of the auditory thalamus were predominantly connected to sensory processing centers, whereas the posterior intralaminar (PIN) and peripeduncular nucleus (PP) were additionally connected to emotion and motivation modulation centers; 2) ventral auditory cortical areas were the major source of cortical inputs for all subdivisions, and the PIN/PP received more inputs from cortical layer 5 than other subdivisions did; 3) deep layers of the superior colliculus and rostral part of the nonlemniscal inferior colliculus preferentially projected to the PIN/PP; and 4) compared with the dorsal auditory thalamus, the PIN/PP mainly innervated association cortices. In addition, new brain areas connected to the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus, mostly the PIN/PP, were identified. Our results suggested subdivision-specific function of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus in sound processing.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Logistical constraints lead to an intermediate optimum in outbreak response vaccination</title>

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Canonical Notch Signaling Directs the Fate of Differentiating Neurocompetent Progenitors in the Mammalian Olfactory Epithelium</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The adult olfactory epithelium (OE) has the remarkable capacity to regenerate fully both neurosensory and non-neuronal cell types after severe epithelial injury. Lifelong persistence of two stem cell populations supports OE regeneration when damaged: the horizontal basal cells (HBCs), dormant and held in reserve; and globose basal cells, a heterogeneous population most of which are actively dividing. Both populations regenerate all cell types of the OE after injury, but the mechanisms underlying neuronal versus non-neuronal lineage commitment after recruitment of the stem cell pools remains unknown. We used both retroviral transduction and mouse lines that permit conditional cell-specific genetic manipulation as well as the tracing of progeny to study the role of canonical &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling in the determination of neuronal versus non-neuronal lineages in the regenerating adult OE. Excision of either &lt;i&gt;Notch1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Notch2&lt;/i&gt; genes alone in HBCs did not alter progenitor fate during recovery from epithelial injury, whereas conditional knock-out of both &lt;i&gt;Notch1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Notch2&lt;/i&gt; together, retroviral transduction of progenitors with a dominant-negative form of &lt;i&gt;MAML&lt;/i&gt; (mastermind-like), or excision of the downstream cofactor &lt;i&gt;RBPJ&lt;/i&gt; caused progeny to adopt a neuronal fate exclusively. Conversely, we show that overexpressing the Notch1-intracellular domain (N1ICD) either genetically or by transduction blocks neuronal differentiation completely. However, N1ICD overexpression requires both alleles of the canonical cofactor RBPJ to specify downstream lineage. Together, our results suggest that canonical RBPJ-dependent &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling through redundant Notch1 and Notch2 receptors is both necessary and sufficient for determining neuronal versus non-neuronal differentiation in the regenerating adult OE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite the substantial reconstitution of the olfactory epithelium and its population of sensory neurons after injury, disruption and exhaustion of neurogenesis is a consequence of aging and a cause of olfactory dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of replacement neurons and non-neuronal cells is critical to any therapeutic strategy aimed at rebuilding a functional neuroepithelium. The results shown here demonstrate that canonical &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling determines the balance between neurons and non-neuronal cells during restoration of the epithelium after injury. Moreover, the complexities of the multiple Notch pathways impinging on that decision are dissected in detail. Finally, RBPJ, the canonical Notch transcriptional cofactor, exhibits a heretofore unreported haploinsufficiency in setting the balance among the regenerating populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Neural Correlates of Hierarchical Predictions for Perceptual Decisions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/5008?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/5008?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory information is inherently noisy, sparse, and ambiguous. In contrast, visual experience is usually clear, detailed, and stable. Bayesian theories of perception resolve this discrepancy by assuming that prior knowledge about the causes underlying sensory stimulation actively shapes perceptual decisions. The CNS is believed to entertain a generative model aligned to dynamic changes in the hierarchical states of our volatile sensory environment. Here, we used model-based fMRI to study the neural correlates of the dynamic updating of hierarchically structured predictions in male and female human observers. We devised a crossmodal associative learning task with covertly interspersed ambiguous trials in which participants engaged in hierarchical learning based on changing contingencies between auditory cues and visual targets. By inverting a Bayesian model of perceptual inference, we estimated individual hierarchical predictions, which significantly biased perceptual decisions under ambiguity. Although &quot;high-level&quot; predictions about the cue–target contingency correlated with activity in supramodal regions such as orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus, dynamic &quot;low-level&quot; predictions about the conditional target probabilities were associated with activity in retinotopic visual cortex. Our results suggest that our CNS updates distinct representations of hierarchical predictions that continuously affect perceptual decisions in a dynamically changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bayesian theories posit that our brain entertains a generative model to provide hierarchical predictions regarding the causes of sensory information. Here, we use behavioral modeling and fMRI to study the neural underpinnings of such hierarchical predictions. We show that &quot;high-level&quot; predictions about the strength of dynamic cue–target contingencies during crossmodal associative learning correlate with activity in orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus, whereas &quot;low-level&quot; conditional target probabilities were reflected in retinotopic visual cortex. Our findings empirically corroborate theorizations on the role of hierarchical predictions in visual perception and contribute substantially to a longstanding debate on the link between sensory predictions and orbitofrontal or hippocampal activity. Our work fundamentally advances the mechanistic understanding of perceptual inference in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral and Neural Representations of Spatial Directions across Words, Schemas, and Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4996?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4996?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern spatial navigation requires fluency with multiple representational formats, including visual scenes, signs, and words. These formats convey different information. Visual scenes are rich and specific but contain extraneous details. Arrows, as an example of signs, are schematic representations in which the extraneous details are eliminated, but analog spatial properties are preserved. Words eliminate all spatial information and convey spatial directions in a purely abstract form. How does the human brain compute spatial directions within and across these formats? To investigate this question, we conducted two experiments on men and women: a behavioral study that was preregistered and a neuroimaging study using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to uncover similarities and differences among representational formats. Participants in the behavioral study viewed spatial directions presented as images, schemas, or words (e.g., &quot;left&quot;), and responded to each trial, indicating whether the spatial direction was the same or different as the one viewed previously. They responded more quickly to schemas and words than images, despite the visual complexity of stimuli being matched. Participants in the fMRI study performed the same task but responded only to occasional catch trials. Spatial directions in images were decodable in the intraparietal sulcus bilaterally but were not in schemas and words. Spatial directions were also decodable between all three formats. These results suggest that intraparietal sulcus plays a role in calculating spatial directions in visual scenes, but this neural circuitry may be bypassed when the spatial directions are presented as schemas or words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human navigators encounter spatial directions in various formats: words (&quot;turn left&quot;), schematic signs (an arrow showing a left turn), and visual scenes (a road turning left). The brain must transform these spatial directions into a plan for action. Here, we investigate similarities and differences between neural representations of these formats. We found that bilateral intraparietal sulci represent spatial directions in visual scenes and across the three formats. We also found that participants respond quickest to schemas, then words, then images, suggesting that spatial directions in abstract formats are easier to interpret than concrete formats. These results support a model of spatial direction interpretation in which spatial directions are either computed for real world action or computed for efficient visual comparison.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Palladin Is a Neuron-Specific Translational Target of mTOR Signaling That Regulates Axon Morphogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4985?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mTOR signaling pathway regulates protein synthesis and diverse aspects of neuronal morphology that are important for brain development and function. To identify proteins controlled translationally by mTOR signaling, we performed ribosome profiling analyses in mouse cortical neurons and embryonic stem cells upon acute mTOR inhibition. Among proteins whose translation was significantly affected by mTOR inhibition selectively in neurons, we identified the cytoskeletal regulator protein palladin, which is localized within the cell body and axons in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of palladin eliminated supernumerary axons induced by suppression of the tuberous sclerosis complex protein TSC1 in neurons, demonstrating that palladin regulates neuronal morphogenesis downstream of mTOR signaling. Our findings provide novel insights into an mTOR-dependent mechanism that controls neuronal morphogenesis through translational regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reports the discovery of neuron-specific protein translational responses to alterations of mTOR activity. By using ribosome profiling analysis, which can reveal the location and quantity of translating ribosomes on mRNAs, multiple aspects of protein translation were quantitatively analyzed in mouse embryonic stem cells and cortical neurons upon acute mTOR inhibition. Neurons displayed distinct patterns of ribosome occupancy for each codon and ribosome stalling during translation at specific positions of mRNAs. Importantly, the cytoskeletal regulator palladin was identified as a translational target protein of mTOR signaling in neurons. Palladin operates downstream of mTOR to modulate axon morphogenesis. This study identifies a novel mechanism of neuronal morphogenesis regulated by mTOR signaling through control of translation of the key protein palladin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity in Human Auditory Cortex Represents Spatial Separation Between Concurrent Sounds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4977?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4977?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primary and posterior auditory cortex (AC) are known for their sensitivity to spatial information, but how this information is processed is not yet understood. AC that is sensitive to spatial manipulations is also modulated by the number of auditory streams present in a scene (Smith et al., 2010), suggesting that spatial and nonspatial cues are integrated for stream segregation. We reasoned that, if this is the case, then it is the distance between sounds rather than their absolute positions that is essential. To test this hypothesis, we measured human brain activity in response to spatially separated concurrent sounds with fMRI at 7 tesla in five men and five women. Stimuli were spatialized amplitude-modulated broadband noises recorded for each participant via in-ear microphones before scanning. Using a linear support vector machine classifier, we investigated whether sound location and/or location plus spatial separation between sounds could be decoded from the activity in Heschl's gyrus and the planum temporale. The classifier was successful only when comparing patterns associated with the conditions that had the largest difference in perceptual spatial separation. Our pattern of results suggests that the representation of spatial separation is not merely the combination of single locations, but rather is an independent feature of the auditory scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Often, when we think of auditory spatial information, we think of where sounds are coming from—that is, the process of localization. However, this information can also be used in scene analysis, the process of grouping and segregating features of a soundwave into objects. Essentially, when sounds are further apart, they are more likely to be segregated into separate streams. Here, we provide evidence that activity in the human auditory cortex represents the spatial separation between sounds rather than their absolute locations, indicating that scene analysis and localization processes may be independent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Response Properties of Accessory Olfactory Bulb Neurons: Limitations and Opportunities for Decoding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The vomeronasal system (VNS) is a major vertebrate chemosensory system that functions in parallel to the main olfactory system (MOS). Despite many similarities, the two systems dramatically differ in the temporal domain. While MOS responses are governed by breathing and follow a subsecond temporal scale, VNS responses are uncoupled from breathing and evolve over seconds. This suggests that the contribution of response dynamics to stimulus information will differ between these systems. While temporal dynamics in the MOS are widely investigated, similar analyses in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) are lacking. Here, we have addressed this issue using controlled stimulus delivery to the vomeronasal organ of male and female mice. We first analyzed the temporal properties of AOB projection neurons and demonstrated that neurons display prolonged, variable, and neuron-specific characteristics. We then analyzed various decoding schemes using AOB population responses. We showed that compared with the simplest scheme (i.e., integration of spike counts over the entire response period), the division of this period into smaller temporal bins actually yields poorer decoding accuracy. However, optimal classification accuracy can be achieved well before the end of the response period by integrating spike counts within temporally defined windows. Since VNS stimulus uptake is variable, we analyzed decoding using limited information about stimulus uptake time, and showed that with enough neurons, such time-invariant decoding is feasible. Finally, we conducted simulations that demonstrated that, unlike the main olfactory bulb, the temporal features of AOB neurons disfavor decoding with high temporal accuracy, and, rather, support decoding without precise knowledge of stimulus uptake time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A key goal in sensory system research is to identify which metrics of neuronal activity are relevant for decoding stimulus features. Here, we describe the first systematic analysis of temporal coding in the vomeronasal system (VNS), a chemosensory system devoted to socially relevant cues. Compared with the main olfactory system, timescales of VNS function are inherently slower and variable. Using various analyses of real and simulated data, we show that the consideration of response times relative to stimulus uptake can aid the decoding of stimulus information from neuronal activity. However, response properties of accessory olfactory bulb neurons favor decoding schemes that do not rely on the precise timing of stimulus uptake. Such schemes are consistent with the variable nature of VNS stimulus uptake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Stoichiometry of the Heteromeric Nicotinic Receptors of the Renshaw Cell</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4943?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentamers built from a variety of subunits. Some are homomeric assemblies of α subunits, others heteromeric assemblies of α and β subunits which can adopt two stoichiometries (2α:3β or 3α:2β). There is evidence for the presence of heteromeric nAChRs with the two stoichiometries in the CNS, but it has not yet been possible to identify them at a given synapse. The 2α:3β receptors are highly sensitive to agonists, whereas the 3α:2β stoichiometric variants, initially described as low sensitivity receptors, are indeed activated by low and high concentrations of ACh. We have taken advantage of the discovery that two compounds (NS9283 and Zn) potentiate selectively the 3α:2β nAChRs to establish (in mice of either sex) the presence of these variants at the motoneuron-Renshaw cell (MN-RC) synapse. NS9283 prolonged the decay of the two-component EPSC mediated by heteromeric nAChRs. NS9283 and Zn also prolonged spontaneous EPSCs involving heteromeric nAChRs, and one could rule out prolongations resulting from AChE inhibition by NS9283. These results establish the presence of 3α:2β nAChRs at the MN-RC synapse. At the functional level, we had previously explained the duality of the EPSC by assuming that high ACh concentrations in the synaptic cleft account for the fast component and that spillover of ACh accounts for the slow component. The dual ACh sensitivity of 3α:2β nAChRs now allows to attribute to these receptors both components of the EPSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Heteromeric nicotinic receptors assemble α and β subunits in pentameric structures, which can adopt two stoichiometries: 3α:2β or 2α:3β. Both stoichiometric variants are present in the CNS, but they have never been located and characterized functionally at the level of an identified synapse. Our data indicate that 3α:2β receptors are present at the spinal cord synapses between motoneurons and Renshaw cells, where their dual mode of activation (by high concentrations of ACh for synaptic receptors, by low concentrations of ACh for extrasynaptic receptors) likely accounts for the biphasic character of the synaptic current. More generally, 3α:2β nicotinic receptors appear unique by their capacity to operate both in the cleft of classical synapses and at extrasynaptic locations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mapping Frequency-Specific Tone Predictions in the Human Auditory Cortex at High Spatial Resolution</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4934?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory inputs reaching our ears are often incomplete, but our brains nevertheless transform them into rich and complete perceptual phenomena such as meaningful conversations or pleasurable music. It has been hypothesized that our brains extract regularities in inputs, which enables us to predict the upcoming stimuli, leading to efficient sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether tone predictions are encoded with similar specificity as perceived signals. Here, we used high-field fMRI to investigate whether human auditory regions encode one of the most defining characteristics of auditory perception: the frequency of predicted tones. Two pairs of tone sequences were presented in ascending or descending directions, with the last tone omitted in half of the trials. Every pair of incomplete sequences contained identical sounds, but was associated with different expectations about the last tone (a high- or low-frequency target). This allowed us to disambiguate predictive signaling from sensory-driven processing. We recorded fMRI responses from eight female participants during passive listening to complete and incomplete sequences. Inspection of specificity and spatial patterns of responses revealed that target frequencies were encoded similarly during their presentations, as well as during omissions, suggesting frequency-specific encoding of predicted tones in the auditory cortex (AC). Importantly, frequency specificity of predictive signaling was observed already at the earliest levels of auditory cortical hierarchy: in the primary AC. Our findings provide evidence for content-specific predictive processing starting at the earliest cortical levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the abundance of sensory information around us in any given moment, it has been proposed that our brain uses contextual information to prioritize and form predictions about incoming signals. However, there remains a surprising lack of understanding of the specificity and content of such prediction signaling; for example, whether a predicted tone is encoded with similar specificity as a perceived tone. Here, we show that early auditory regions encode the frequency of a tone that is predicted yet omitted. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how expectations shape sound processing in the human auditory cortex and provide further insights into how contextual information influences computations in neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Encoding of Serial Order in Working Memory: Neuronal Activity in Motor, Premotor, and Prefrontal Cortex during a Memory Scanning Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4912?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4912?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have adapted Sternberg's context-recall task to investigate the neural mechanisms of encoding serial order information in working memory, in 2 male rhesus monkeys. We recorded from primary motor, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while the monkeys performed the task. In each cortical area, most neurons displayed marked modulation of activity during the list presentation period of the task, whereas the serial order of the stimuli needed to be encoded in working memory. The activity of many neurons changed in a consistent manner over the course of the list presentation period, without regard to the location of the stimuli presented. Remarkably, these neurons encoded serial position information in a relative (rather than absolute) manner across different list lengths. In addition, many neurons showed activity related to both location and serial position, in the form of an interaction effect. Surprisingly, the activity of these neurons was often modulated by the location of stimuli presented before the epoch in which the activity changes occurred. In motor and premotor areas, a large proportion of neurons with list presentation activity also showed direction-related activity during the response phase, whereas in prefrontal cortex most cells showed only list presentation effects. These results show that many neurons had a heterogeneous functionality by representing distinct task variables at different periods of the task. Finally, potential confounds could not account for the effects observed. For these reasons, we conclude that these neurons were indeed participating in sequence encoding in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traditionally, primary motor, premotor, and prefrontal areas have been considered to be mainly engaged in motor output, visuomotor transformation, and higher cognitive functions, respectively. Here we show that neurons in all three cortical regions participate in the encoding of a sequence of spatial stimuli in working memory. Furthermore, a central question in cognitive neuroscience has been the manner in which the position of an item within a sequence is encoded in the brain. Our findings provide direct neurophysiological support for a specific hypothesis from cognitive psychology: that of relative coding of serial order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GDNF, Neurturin, and Artemin Activate and Sensitize Bone Afferent Neurons and Contribute to Inflammatory Bone Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain associated with skeletal pathology or disease is a significant clinical problem, but the mechanisms that generate and/or maintain it remain poorly understood. In this study, we explored roles for GDNF, neurturin, and artemin signaling in bone pain using male Sprague Dawley rats. We have shown that inflammatory bone pain involves activation and sensitization of peptidergic, NGF-sensitive neurons via artemin/GDNF family receptor α-3 (GFRα3) signaling pathways, and that sequestering artemin might be useful to prevent inflammatory bone pain derived from activation of NGF-sensitive bone afferent neurons. In addition, we have shown that inflammatory bone pain also involves activation and sensitization of nonpeptidergic neurons via GDNF/GFRα1 and neurturin/GFRα2 signaling pathways, and that sequestration of neurturin, but not GDNF, might be useful to treat inflammatory bone pain derived from activation of nonpeptidergic bone afferent neurons. Our findings suggest that GDNF family ligand signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of bone pain and could be targets for pharmacological manipulations to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain associated with skeletal pathology, including bone cancer, bone marrow edema syndromes, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and fractures causes a major burden (both in terms of quality of life and cost) on individuals and health care systems worldwide. We have shown the first evidence of a role for GDNF, neurturin, and artemin in the activation and sensitization of bone afferent neurons, and that sequestering these ligands reduces pain behavior in a model of inflammatory bone pain. Thus, GDNF family ligand signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of bone pain and could be targets for pharmacological manipulations to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decomposing Gratitude: Representation and Integration of Cognitive Antecedents of Gratitude in the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4886?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is a typical social-moral emotion that plays a crucial role in maintaining human cooperative interpersonal relationship. Although neural correlates of gratitude have been investigated, the neurocognitive processes that lead to gratitude, namely, the representation and integration of its cognitive antecedents, remain largely unknown. Here, we combined fMRI and a human social interactive task to investigate how benefactor's cost and beneficiary's benefit, two critical antecedents of gratitude, are encoded and integrated in beneficiary's brain, and how the neural processing of gratitude is converted to reciprocity. A coplayer decided whether to help a human participant (either male or female) avoid pain at his/her own monetary cost; the participants could transfer monetary points to the benefactor with the knowledge that the benefactor was unaware of this transfer. By independently manipulating monetary cost and the degree of pain reduction, we could identify the neural signatures of benefactor's cost and recipient's benefit and examine how they were integrated. Recipient's self-benefit was encoded in reward-sensitive regions (e.g., ventral striatum), whereas benefactor-cost was encoded in regions associated with mentalizing (e.g., temporoparietal junction). Gratitude was represented in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), the strength of which correlated with trait gratitude. Dynamic causal modeling showed that the neural signals representing benefactor-cost and self-benefit passed to pgACC via effective connectivities, suggesting an integrative role of pgACC in generating gratitude. Moreover, gyral ACC plays an intermediary role in converting gratitude representation into reciprocal behaviors. Our findings provide a neural mechanistic account of gratitude and its role in social-moral life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gratitude plays an integral role in subjective well-being and harmonious interpersonal relationships. However, the neurocognitive processes through which various components and antecedents of gratitude are integrated remain largely unknown. We developed a new interpersonal paradigm to independently and parametrically manipulate two antecedents of gratitude in a helping context, namely, the benefit to beneficiary and the cost to benefactor, to examine their representation and integration in the beneficiary's brain using fMRI. We found the neural encoding of self-benefit and benefactor-cost in reward- and mentalizing-related brain areas, respectively. More importantly, by examining effective connectivity, we showed that these componential signals are passed to perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, which tracks trial-by-trial gratitude levels. Our study thus provides a neural mechanistic account of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Primary Tactile Thalamus Spiking Reflects Cognitive Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4870?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4870?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Little is known about whether information transfer at primary sensory thalamic nuclei is modified by behavioral context. Here we studied the influence of previous decisions/rewards on current choices and preceding spike responses of ventroposterior medial thalamus (VPm; the primary sensory thalamus in the rat whisker-related tactile system). We trained head-fixed rats to detect a ramp-like deflection of one whisker interspersed within ongoing white noise stimulation. Using generative modeling of behavior, we identify two task-related variables that are predictive of actual decisions. The first reflects task engagement on a local scale (&quot;trial history&quot;: defined as the decisions and outcomes of a small number of past trials), whereas the other captures behavioral dynamics on a global scale (&quot;satiation&quot;: slow dynamics of the response pattern along an entire session). Although satiation brought about a slow drift from Go to NoGo decisions during the session, trial history was related to local (trial-by-trial) patterning of Go and NoGo decisions. A second model that related the same predictors first to VPm spike responses, and from there to decisions, indicated that spiking, in contrast to behavior, is sensitive to trial history but relatively insensitive to satiation. Trial history influences VPm spike rates and regularity such that a history of Go decisions would predict fewer noise-driven spikes (but more regular ones), and more ramp-driven spikes. Neuronal activity in VPm, thus, is sensitive to local behavioral history, and may play an important role in higher-order cognitive signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is an important question for perceptual and brain functions to find out whether cognitive signals modulate the sensory signal stream and if so, where in the brain this happens. This study provides evidence that decision and reward history can already be reflected in the ascending sensory pathway, on the level of first-order sensory thalamus. Cognitive signals are relayed very selectively such that only local trial history (spanning a few trials) but not global history (spanning an entire session) are reflected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drift in Neural Population Activity Causes Working Memory to Deteriorate Over Time</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4859?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4859?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Short-term memories are thought to be maintained in the form of sustained spiking activity in neural populations. Decreases in recall precision observed with increasing number of memorized items can be accounted for by a limit on total spiking activity, resulting in fewer spikes contributing to the representation of each individual item. Longer retention intervals likewise reduce recall precision, but it is unknown what changes in population activity produce this effect. One possibility is that spiking activity becomes attenuated over time, such that the same mechanism accounts for both effects of set size and retention duration. Alternatively, reduced performance may be caused by drift in the encoded value over time, without a decrease in overall spiking activity. Human participants of either sex performed a variable-delay cued recall task with a saccadic response, providing a precise measure of recall latency. Based on a spike integration model of decision making, if the effects of set size and retention duration are both caused by decreased spiking activity, we would predict a fixed relationship between recall precision and response latency across conditions. In contrast, the drift hypothesis predicts no systematic changes in latency with increasing delays. Our results show both an increase in latency with set size, and a decrease in response precision with longer delays within each set size, but no systematic increase in latency for increasing delay durations. These results were quantitatively reproduced by a model based on a limited neural resource in which working memories drift rather than decay with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rapid deterioration over seconds is a defining feature of short-term memory, but what mechanism drives this degradation of internal representations? Here, we extend a successful population coding model of working memory by introducing possible mechanisms of delay effects. We show that a decay in neural signal over time predicts that the time required for memory retrieval will increase with delay, whereas a random drift in the stored value predicts no effect of delay on retrieval time. Testing these predictions in a multi-item memory task with an eye movement response, we identified drift as a key mechanism of memory decline. These results provide evidence for a dynamic spiking basis for working memory, in contrast to recent proposals of activity-silent storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine Triggers CTCF-Dependent Morphological and Genomic Remodeling of Astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4846?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4846?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is critical for processing of reward and etiology of drug addiction. Astrocytes throughout the brain express dopamine receptors, but consequences of astrocytic dopamine receptor signaling are not well established. We found that extracellular dopamine triggered rapid concentration-dependent stellation of astrocytic processes that was not a result of dopamine oxidation but instead relied on both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent dopamine receptor signaling. This was accompanied by reduced duration and increased frequency of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, but little effect on astrocytic voltage-gated potassium channel currents. To isolate possible mechanisms underlying these structural and functional changes, we used whole-genome RNA sequencing and found prominent dopamine-induced enrichment of genes containing the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) motif, suggesting involvement of chromatin restructuring in the nucleus. CTCF binding to promoter sites bidirectionally regulates gene transcription and depends on activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Accordingly, antagonism of PARP1 occluded dopamine-induced changes, whereas a PARP1 agonist facilitated dopamine-induced changes on its own. These results indicate that astrocyte response to elevated dopamine involves PARP1-mediated CTCF genomic restructuring and concerted expression of gene networks. Our findings propose epigenetic regulation of chromatin landscape as a critical factor in the rapid astrocyte response to dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although dopamine is widely recognized for its role in modulating neuronal responses both in healthy and disease states, little is known about dopamine effects at non-neuronal cells in the brain. To address this gap, we performed whole-genome sequencing of astrocytes exposed to elevated extracellular dopamine and combined it with evaluation of effects on astrocyte morphology and function. We demonstrate a temporally dynamic pattern of genomic plasticity that triggers pronounced changes in astrocyte morphology and function. We further show that this plasticity depends on activation of genes sensitive to DNA-binding protein CTCF. Our results propose that a broad pattern of astrocyte responses to dopamine specifically relies on CTCF-dependent gene networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Uncovering Neuronal Networks Defined by Consistent Between-Neuron Spike Timing from Neuronal Spike Recordings</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network’s spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multineuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization (LTS) training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory (LTM) in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for LTS in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: dSTIM and Ral/Exocyst Mediated Synaptic Release from Pupal Dopaminergic Neurons Sustains Drosophila Flight</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behaviour in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of either dSTIM, Ral or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Appropriate wiring of neuronal circuits during development is essential for adult behavior and cellular mechanisms such as calcium signaling orchestrate the pattern and strength of such neuronal connections to a significant extent. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, flight behavior impacts multiple aspects of life. Calcium, especially through the Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway, regulates gene expression during flight circuit maturation. &lt;i&gt;Ral,&lt;/i&gt; encodes a small GTPase, and is one such SOCE-regulated gene required for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight. In this paper, we show that SOCE-related loss of flight is determined to a significant extent by Ral and the exocyst complex driven synaptic vesicle release in pupal dopaminergic neurons. Thus, SOCE regulated release of dopamine ensures correct wiring of the flight circuit in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic Interactions between Emotion Perception, Action Perception, and Action Preparation Areas for Reacting to Social Threat: A Combined cTBS-fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0408-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0408-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their connectivity with the amygdala (AMG), known to play a crucial role in processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions; two preceded by stimulation of either right IPL or PMv, and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the lAMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than neutral stimuli. In addition, effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; When confronted with social threat, the brain must prepare situation-adaptive responses. Previous studies have shown that IPL and PMv are critically involved in social threat perception and that amygdala is triggered by emotional valence of the stimuli. So far, the causal relation between IPL, PMv and amygdala is not clear. By combining cTBS with fMRI, we show that stimulation of IPL and PMv induces significant differences between perception of angry versus neutral bodies in amygdala. Furthermore, stimulation of these areas led to significant interaction effects between the emotion presented and site stimulated in a number of remote parietal and motor areas. Our findings demonstrate involvement of IPL and PMv in emotion body processing, and interaction between these areas and with the amygdala during this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Amygdala Corticofugal Input Shapes Mitral Cell Responses in the Accessory Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala (PmCo) feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feed-forward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells (GC). In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Olfactory inputs are relayed directly through the amygdala to hypothalamic and limbic system nuclei regulating essential responses in the context of social behavior. However, it is not clear whether and how amygdala circuits participate in the earlier steps of olfactory processing at the level of the olfactory bulb. Unraveling the organization of this circuitry is critical to understand the function of amygdala circuits. Combining cre-dependent viral tracing with optogenetic-assisted patch clamp electrophysiology, the present work maps the synaptic connectivity and physiology of a cortical amygdala pathway innervating primary olfactory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Polymorphic sites preferentially avoid co-evolving residues in MHC class I proteins</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by cross-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may also have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid those under co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Implications for human odor sensing revealed from the statistics of odorant-receptor interactions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J. Jang, Changbong Hyeon&lt;/p&gt;

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systematic interrogation of diverse Omic data reveals interpretable, robust, and generalizable transcriptomic features of clinically successful therapeutic targets</title>

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features. Code, documentation, and data for this study have been deposited on GitHub at https://github.com/arouillard/omic-features-successful-targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vNbdSy5pqZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Perceptual Oscillation of Audio-Visual Time Simultaneity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action and perception are tightly coupled systems requiring coordination and synchronization over time. How the brain achieves synchronization is still a matter of debate, but recent experiments suggest that brain oscillations may play an important role in this process. Brain oscillations have been also proposed to be fundamental in determining time perception. Here, we had subjects perform an audio-visual temporal order judgment task to investigate the fine dynamics of temporal bias and sensitivity before and after the execution of voluntary hand movement (button-press). The reported order of the audio-visual sequence was rhythmically biased as a function of delay from hand action execution. Importantly, we found that it oscillated at a theta range frequency, starting about 500 ms before and persisting about 250 ms after the button-press, with consistent phase-locking across participants. Our results show that the perception of cross-sensory simultaneity oscillates rhythmically in synchrony with the programming phase of a voluntary action, demonstrating a link between action preparation and bias in temporal perceptual judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Judgments of the temporal order of a visual and auditory stimulus are not constant over time but fluctuate rhythmically in the theta range (around 7 Hz) in synchrony with the execution of a voluntary movement. Interestingly, these oscillations precede the action execution by about half a second, indicating active synchronization between temporal criterion and the intention to move. Overall, the results point to the presence of a single shared clock for perception and action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Moment-to-Moment Fluctuations in Neuronal Excitability Bias Subjective Perception Rather than Strategic Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus not only depends on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual acuity, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task-independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e. 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing low-frequency oscillations (8–30 Hz), has a strong influence on perception. However, the specific mechanism underlying this influence is a continuing subject of debate in neuroscience. Previous research showed that states of heightened excitability make observers report the presence of a sensory stimulus even when none is present. Heightened excitability may therefore indicate a state of strategic decision-making (i.e. observers prefer to report &quot;Yes, I saw the stimulus&quot;) or a state of amplified subjective perception (i.e. observers experience a stimulus even when none is present). Here, we tested these alternative interpretations and found evidence that fluctuations in neuronal excitability bias the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: RGS14 Restricts Plasticity in Hippocampal CA2 by Limiting Postsynaptic Calcium Signaling</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer Collateral synapses. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin, and CaMKII. Here, we investigate whether RGS14 regulates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We find the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses due to genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies of hippocampal area CA2 have provided strong evidence in support of a clear role for this apparently plasticity-resistant subregion of the hippocampus in social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a critical factor that inhibits synaptic plasticity in CA2, but the molecular mechanisms by which RGS14 limits LTP remained unknown. Here we provide new evidence that RGS14 restricts spine calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in CA2 neurons and that key downstream Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated signaling pathways are required for CA2 plasticity in mice lacking RGS14. These results define a previously unrecognized role for RGS14 as a natural inhibitor of postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in hippocampal area CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in Hearing Acuity among &quot;Normal-Hearing&quot; Young Adults Modulate the Neural Basis for Speech Comprehension</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0263-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0263-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate how subtle differences in hearing acuity affect the neural systems supporting speech processing in young adults. Auditory sentence comprehension requires perceiving a complex acoustic signal and performing linguistic operations to extract the correct meaning. We used fMRI to monitor human brain activity while adults aged 18–41 listened to spoken sentences. The sentences varied in their level of syntactic processing demands, containing either a subject-relative or object-relative center-embedded clause. All participants self-reported normal hearing, confirmed by audiometric testing, with some variation within a clinically normal range. We found that participants showed activity related to sentence processing in a left-lateralized frontotemporal network. Although accuracy was generally high, participants still made some errors, which were associated with increased activity in bilateral cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal attention networks. A whole-brain regression analysis revealed that activity in a right anterior middle frontal gyrus (aMFG) component of the frontoparietal attention network was related to individual differences in hearing acuity, such that listeners with poorer hearing showed greater recruitment of this region when successfully understanding a sentence. The activity in right aMFG’s for listeners with poor hearing did not differ as a function of sentence type, suggesting a general mechanism that is independent of linguistic processing demands. Our results suggest that even modest variations in hearing ability impact the systems supporting auditory speech comprehension, and that auditory sentence comprehension entails the coordination of a left perisylvian network that is sensitive to linguistic variation with an executive attention network that responds to acoustic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Hearing loss is associated with increased cognitive demand during speech comprehension. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity while healthy adults with self-reported normal hearing listened to spoken sentences. We found that regions of right frontal cortex, outside of the traditional perisylvian language network, are more active for listeners with poorer hearing as measured with pure-tone audiometry. These findings suggest executive attention varies with hearing ability, even in the absence of clinical hearing loss, during successful auditory sentence comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine neurons project to numerous targets throughout the brain to modulate various behaviors and brain states. Within this small population of neurons exists significant heterogeneity based on physiology, circuitry, and disease susceptibility. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons can be subdivided based on gene expression; however, the extent to which genetic markers represent functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations has not been fully explored. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse dopamine neurons and validated studies showing that &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; are selective markers for dopaminergic subpopulations. Using a combination of multiplex fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology in mice of both sexes, we defined the anatomy, projection targets, physiological properties, and disease vulnerability of dopamine neurons based on &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; expression. We find that the combinatorial expression of &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; defines dopaminergic subpopulations with unique features. &lt;i&gt;Grp+/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;+ dopamine neurons reside in the ventromedial VTA, send projections to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, and have non-canonical physiological properties. &lt;i&gt;Grp+/Neurod6-&lt;/i&gt; DA neurons are found in the VTA as well as in the ventromedial portion of the SNc where they project selectively to the dorsomedial striatum. &lt;i&gt;Grp-/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;+ DA neurons represent a smaller VTA subpopulation, which is preferentially spared in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s disease. Together our work provides detailed characterization of &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; expression in the midbrain and generates new insights into how these markers define functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations with distinct projection patterns, physiology, and disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent single cell gene profiling studies have uncovered new subpopulations of midbrain dopamine neurons defined by their specific genetic signature. How these genetically-defined cell types map onto known dopaminergic circuits and functionally-defined cell types is unknown. This study elucidates the anatomy, circuitry, physiologic properties, and disease susceptibility of subpopulations of midbrain DA neurons defined by their expression of two genetic markers. This work not only advances our understanding of the dopaminergic system by providing new information about the properties of specific dopamine neuron subpopulations, it also demonstrates that unbiased genetic classification of neurons can reveal functionally relevant cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: TRPV1 Agonist, Capsaicin, Induces Axon Outgrowth after Injury via Ca2+/PKA Signaling</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-conditioning nerve injuries activate a pro-regenerative program that enhances axon regeneration for most classes of sensory neurons. However, nociceptive sensory neurons and central nervous system neurons regenerate poorly. In hopes of identifying novel mechanisms that promote regeneration, we screened for drugs that mimicked the pre-conditioning response, and identified a nociceptive ligand that activates a pre-conditioning-like response to promote axon outgrowth. We show that activating the ion channel TRPV1 with capsaicin induces axon outgrowth of cultured DRG sensory neurons, and that this effect is blocked in TRPV1 knockout neurons. Regeneration only occurs in NF200-negative nociceptive neurons, consistent with a cell autonomous mechanism. Moreover, we identify a signaling pathway in which TRPV1 activation leads to calcium influx and PKA activation to induce a pre-conditioning-like response. Finally, capsaicin administration to the mouse sciatic nerve activates a similar pre-conditioning-like response and induces enhanced axonal outgrowth, indicating that this pathway can be induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings highlight the use of local ligands to induce regeneration, and suggest that it may be possible to target selective neuronal populations for repair, including cell types that often fail to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; After injury or neurodegenerative disease, axons need to regenerate to restore function. Unfortunately, no current therapies achieve this goal. We performed a drug screen in adult sensory neurons to identify agents that effectively re-program neurons into a pro-growth state. We demonstrate that capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, activates a pro-axon growth program. This mechanism requires calcium influx and PKA activity, and leads to the activation of the pro-regenerative transcription factor CREB. Hence, activation of ion channels can promote axon regeneration, an exciting finding since many ion channels are druggable targets. Moreover, these findings suggest an approach for enhancing axon regeneration in selective populations of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Contribution of the Axon Initial Segment to Action Potentials Recorded Extracellularly</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature (the extracellular action potential, EAP) generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. Soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potential recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signficance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Action potentials in most neurons initiate in the axon initial segment (AIS). However, the AIS is often neglected in computational studies. We studied the consequences of this initiation mechanism on the extracellular signatures of action potentials. We show that at the time of AP initiation AIS forms a dipole with the soma. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the extracellular action potential (EAP) generated by this dipole changes little with changing soma–AIS distance while the width of the EAP increases with the soma–AIS distance. This may help to monitor dynamic changes in the soma–AIS distance in experimental &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Atomic resolution mechanism of ligand binding to a solvent inaccessible cavity in T4 lysozyme</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E. Kay, Pramodh Vallurupalli&lt;/p&gt;

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Resembles Cortical Architecture at Various Levels of Isoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy114</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy114/4999310?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical single neuron activity and local field potential patterns change at different depths of general anesthesia. Here, we investigate the associated network level changes of functional connectivity. We recorded ongoing electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from temporo-parieto-occipital cortex of 6 ferrets at various levels of isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia and determined functional connectivity by computing amplitude envelope correlations. Through hierarchical clustering, we derived typical connectivity patterns corresponding to light, intermediate and deep anesthesia. Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied, at the deepest level, by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalization of functional connectivity to the distribution of correlation coefficients showed that the topographical patterns remained similar across depths of anesthesia, reflecting the functional association of the underlying cortical areas. Thus, while strength and temporal properties of amplitude co-modulation vary depending on the activity of local neural circuits, their network-level interaction pattern is presumably most strongly determined by the underlying structural connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Correct Laminar Positioning in the Neocortex Influences Proper Dendritic and Synaptic Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy113</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy113/4999309?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neocortex is a 6-layered laminated structure with a precise anatomical and functional organization ensuring proper function. Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down doublecortin (Dcx), a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines, and functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prior Knowledge Guides Speech Segregation in Human Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy052</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy052/4999308?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Segregating concurrent sound streams is a computationally challenging task that requires integrating bottom-up acoustic cues (e.g. pitch) and top-down prior knowledge about sound streams. In a multi-talker environment, the brain can segregate different speakers in about 100 ms in auditory cortex. Here, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate the temporal and spatial signature of how the brain utilizes prior knowledge to segregate 2 speech streams from the same speaker, which can hardly be separated based on bottom-up acoustic cues. In a primed condition, the participants know the target speech stream in advance while in an unprimed condition no such prior knowledge is available. Neural encoding of each speech stream is characterized by the MEG responses tracking the speech envelope. We demonstrate that an effect in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus is much stronger in the primed condition than in the unprimed condition. Priming effects are observed at about 100 ms latency and last more than 600 ms. Interestingly, prior knowledge about the target stream facilitates speech segregation by mainly suppressing the neural tracking of the non-target speech stream. In sum, prior knowledge leads to reliable speech segregation in auditory cortex, even in the absence of reliable bottom-up speech segregation cue.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Excitability and Local Connectivity of mPFC-PAG Neurons in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4829?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a major role in both sensory and affective aspects of pain. There is extensive evidence that chronic pain produces functional changes within the mPFC. However, our understanding of local circuit changes to defined subpopulations of mPFC neurons in chronic pain models remains unclear. A major subpopulation of mPFC neurons project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a key midbrain structure involved in endogenous pain suppression and facilitation. Here, we used laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate to map cortical circuits of retrogradely labeled cortico-PAG (CP) neurons in layer 5 (L5) of mPFC in brain slices prepared from male mice having undergone chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Whole-cell recordings revealed a significant reduction in excitability for L5 CP neurons contralateral to CCI in the prelimbic (PL), but not infralimbic (IL), region of mPFC. Circuit mapping showed that excitatory inputs to L5 CP neurons in both PL and IL arose primarily from layer 2/3 (L2/3) and were significantly reduced in CCI mice. Glutamate stimulation of L2/3 and L5 elicited inhibitory inputs to CP neurons in both PL and IL, but only L2/3 input was significantly reduced in CP neurons of CCI mice. We also observed significant reduction in excitability and L2/3 inhibitory input to CP neurons ipsilateral to CCI. These results demonstrating region and laminar specific changes to mPFC-PAG neurons suggest that a unilateral CCI bilaterally alters cortical circuits upstream of the endogenous analgesic network, which may contribute to persistence of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a significant unresolved medical problem that is refractory to traditional analgesics and can negatively affect emotional health. The role of central circuits in mediating the persistent nature of chronic pain remains unclear. Local circuits within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) process ascending pain inputs and can modulate endogenous analgesia via direct projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG). However, the mechanisms by which chronic pain alters intracortical circuitry of mPFC-PAG neurons are unknown. Here, we report specific changes to local circuits of mPFC-PAG neurons in mice displaying chronic pain behavior after nerve injury. These findings provide evidence for a neural mechanism by which chronic pain disrupts the descending analgesic system via functional changes to cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: mTORC1 Is Transiently Reactivated in Injured Nerves to Promote c-Jun Elevation and Schwann Cell Dedifferentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4811?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4811?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are endowed with a remarkable plasticity. When peripheral nerves are injured, SCs dedifferentiate and acquire new functions to coordinate nerve repair as so-called repair SCs. Subsequently, SCs redifferentiate to remyelinate regenerated axons. Given the similarities between SC dedifferentiation/redifferentiation in injured nerves and in demyelinating neuropathies, elucidating the signals involved in SC plasticity after nerve injury has potentially wider implications. c-Jun has emerged as a key transcription factor regulating SC dedifferentiation and the acquisition of repair SC features. However, the upstream pathways that control c-Jun activity after nerve injury are largely unknown. We report that the mTORC1 pathway is transiently but robustly reactivated in dedifferentiating SCs. By inducible genetic deletion of the functionally crucial mTORC1-subunit Raptor in mouse SCs (including male and female animals), we found that mTORC1 reactivation is necessary for proper myelin clearance, SC dedifferentiation, and consequently remyelination, without major alterations in the inflammatory response. In the absence of mTORC1 signaling, c-Jun failed to be upregulated correctly. Accordingly, a c-Jun binding motif was found to be enriched in promoters of genes with reduced expression in injured mutants. Furthermore, using cultured SCs, we found that mTORC1 is involved in c-Jun regulation by promoting its translation, possibly via the eIF4F-subunit eIF4A. These results provide evidence that proper c-Jun elevation after nerve injury involves also mTORC1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation to ensure timely dedifferentiation of SCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A crucial evolutionary acquisition of vertebrates is the envelopment of axons in myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS. When myelin is damaged, conduction of action potentials along axons slows down or is blocked, leading to debilitating diseases. Unlike oligodendrocytes, SCs have a high regenerative potential, granted by their remarkable plasticity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying SC plasticity may uncover new therapeutic targets in nerve regeneration and demyelinating diseases. Our work reveals that reactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in SCs is essential for efficient SC dedifferentiation after nerve injury. Accordingly, modulating this signaling pathway might be of therapeutic relevance in peripheral nerve injury and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional neuronal connectivity requires proper neuronal morphogenesis and its dysregulation causes neurodevelopmental diseases. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines play pivotal roles in development, but little is known about their contribution to morphological development of neurons. Here we show that the Smad-dependent canonical signaling of TGF-β family cytokines negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis during brain development. Mechanistically, activated Smads form a complex with transcriptional repressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF), and downregulate the expression of a neuronal polarity regulator, collapsin response mediator protein 2. We also demonstrate that TGF-β family signaling inhibits neurite elongation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Furthermore, the expression of TGF-β receptor 1, Smad4, or TGIF, which have mutations found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, disrupted neuronal morphogenesis in both mouse (male and female) and human (female) neurons. Together, these findings suggest that the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by an evolutionarily conserved function of TGF-β signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a crucial role in multiple organ development, including brain, and mutations in components of the signaling pathway associated with several human developmental disorders. In this study, we found that Smads/TG-interacting factor-dependent canonical TGF-β signaling regulates neuronal morphogenesis through the suppression of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) expression during brain development, and that function of this signaling is evolutionarily conserved in the mammalian brain. Mutations in canonical TGF-β signaling factors identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt the morphological development of neurons. Thus, our results suggest that proper control of TGF-β/Smads/CRMP2 signaling pathways is critical for the precise execution of neuronal morphogenesis, whose impairment eventually results in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Term or Preterm Cesarean Section Delivery Does Not Lead to Long-term Detrimental Consequences in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy112</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy112/4996561?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological studies have provided contradictory data on the deleterious sequels of cesarean section (C-section) delivery and their links with developmental brain disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. To gain better insight on these issues, we have now compared physiological, morphological, and behavioral parameters in vaginal, term, and preterm C-section delivered mice. We report that C-section delivery does not lead to long-term behavioral alterations though preterm C-section delivery modifies communicative behaviors in pups. Moreover, C-section delivery neither alters the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) developmental excitatory to inhibitory shift nor the frequency or amplitude of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, these neurons present an underdeveloped dendritic arbor at birth in pups born by C-section delivery, but this difference disappears 1 day later suggesting an accelerated growth after birth. Therefore, C-section delivery, with prematurity as an aggravating factor, induces transient developmental delays but neither impacts the GABA developmental sequence nor leads to long-term consequences in mice. The deleterious sequels of C-section delivery described in epidemiological studies might be due to a perinatal insult that could be aggravated by C-section delivery.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Local Cortical Gyrification is Increased in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, but Decreases Rapidly in Adolescents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy111</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy111/4996560?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extensive MRI evidence indicates early brain overgrowth in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Local gyrification may reflect the distribution and timing of aberrant cortical expansion in ASDs. We examined MRI data from (Study 1) 64 individuals with ASD and 64 typically developing (TD) controls (7–19 years), and from (Study 2) an independent sample from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 31/group). Local Gyrification Index (lGI), cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) were measured. In Study 1, differences in lGI (ASD &amp;gt; TD) were found in left parietal and temporal and right frontal and temporal regions. lGI decreased bilaterally with age, but more steeply in ASD in left precentral, right lateral occipital, and middle frontal clusters. CT differed between groups in right perisylvian cortex (TD &amp;gt; ASD), but no differences were found for SA. Partial correlations between lGI and CT were generally negative, but associations were weaker in ASD in several clusters. Study 2 results were consistent, though less extensive. Altered gyrification may reflect unique information about the trajectory of cortical development in ASDs. While early overgrowth tends to be undetectable in later childhood in ASDs, findings may indicate that a trace of this developmental abnormality could remain in a disorder-specific pattern of gyrification.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Multiple Regions of a Cortical Network Commonly Encode the Meaning of Words in Multiple Grammatical Positions of Read Sentences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy110</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy110/4996559?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Deciphering how sentence meaning is represented in the brain remains a major challenge to science. Semantically related neural activity has recently been shown to arise concurrently in distributed brain regions as successive words in a sentence are read. However, what semantic content is represented by different regions, what is common across them, and how this relates to words in different grammatical positions of sentences is weakly understood. To address these questions, we apply a semantic model of word meaning to interpret brain activation patterns elicited in sentence reading. The model is based on human ratings of 65 sensory/motor/emotional and cognitive features of experience with words (and their referents). Through a process of mapping functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activation back into model space we test: which brain regions semantically encode content words in different grammatical positions (e.g., subject/verb/object); and what semantic features are encoded by different regions. In left temporal, inferior parietal, and inferior/superior frontal regions we detect the semantic encoding of words in all grammatical positions tested and reveal multiple common components of semantic representation. This suggests that sentence comprehension involves a common core representation of multiple words’ meaning being encoded in a network of regions distributed across the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sex Differences in the Adult Human Brain: Evidence from 5216 UK Biobank Participants</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The non-cell autonomous transfer of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor into juvenile mouse cerebral cortex regulates parvalbumin interneuron maturation and critical period timing. By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Otx2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/GFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice at plastic and nonplastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; upregulation. Viral expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b&lt;/span&gt; in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The dentate gyrus (DG) is hypothesized to be a pattern separator crucial for distinguishing similar memories. In this issue of Neuron, a new study by van Dijk and Fenton (2018) revealed that transient changes of firing patterns of DG ensembles, but not the remapping of session-averaged place fields, contributed to a place discrimination task.</description>

	<description>Live imaging studies in mice show that adult-born oligodendrocytes and myelin are remarkably stable. Neural activity enhances oligodendrocyte integration, arguing that internode addition rather than alteration represents the mechanism for any experience-dependent cortical myelination changes that might underpin learning.</description>

	<description>Ataxin-2 is an RNA-binding protein involved in translation regulation and mutated in neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. In this issue of Neuron, Bakthavachalu et al. (2018) demonstrate that higher order ataxin-2 RNA/protein assemblies are necessary for both translation-dependent learning and ALS-associated neurodegeneration in Drosophila.</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Zhang et al. (2018) report a powerful new method for probing subcellular microdomain-specific signaling in cellular function. Through a microdomain-targeting approach, they delineate how Ras-family GTPases balance signaling diversity with specificity required for various forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</description>

	<description>Stimuli suppress cortical correlated variability. Hennequin et al. show that a cortical operating regime of inhibitory stabilization around a single stable state—the “stabilized supralinear network”—explains this suppression’s tuning and timing, while alternative proposed regimes do not.</description>

	<description>Interplay between genetic and environmental factors during critical time windows can have effects that span from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration. We present the concept of the ‘neuroexposome’, emphasizing the brain’s distinctive response to environmental exposure, and how current ‘omics’ sciences can inform on both disease pathogenesis and future public health policies.</description>

A study demonstrates that different forms of synaptic homeostasis respond to distinct aspects of circuit activity, suggesting that neurons can gauge and adapt to the both the quality and quantity of circuit activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/FFtaTRZ7d_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Deployment of Visual Attention During Interactive Approach and Avoidance Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy105</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy105/4994603?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to coordinate approach and avoidance actions in dynamic environments represents the boundary between extinction and the continued survival of many animal species. It is therefore crucial that sensory systems allocate limited attentional resources to the most relevant information to facilitate planning and execution of appropriate actions. Prominent theories of how attention regulates visual processing focus on the distinction between behaviorally relevant and irrelevant visual inputs. To date, however, no study has directly compared the deployment of attention to visual inputs relevant for approach and avoidance behaviors, which naturally occur in dynamic, interactive environments. In two experiments, we combined electroencephalography, frequency tagging, and eye gaze measures to investigate whether the deployment of visual selective attention differs for items relevant for approach and avoidance actions. Participants maneuvered a cursor to approach and avoid contact with moving items in a continuous interactive task. The results indicated that while the approach and avoidance tasks recruited equivalent attentional resources overall, attentional biases were directed toward task-relevant items during approach, and away from task-relevant items during avoidance. We conclude that the deployment of visual attention is guided not only by relevance to a behavioral goal, but also by the nature of that goal.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Independent Early and Late Sensory Processes for Proprioceptive Integration When Planning a Step</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy104</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy104/4994602?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Somatosensory inputs to the cortex undergo an early and a later stage of processing which are characterized by an early and a late somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). The early response is highly representative of the stimulus characteristics whereas the late response reflects a more integrative, task specific, stage of sensory processing. We hypothesized that the later processing stage is independent of the early processing stage. We tested the prediction that a reduction of the first volley of input to the cortex should not prevent the increase of the late SEP. Using the sensory interference phenomenon, we halved the amplitude of the early response to somatosensory input of the ankle joints (evoked by vibration) when participants either planned a step forward or remained still. Despite the initial cortical response to the vibration being massively decreased in both tasks, the late response was still enhanced during step planning. Source localization indicated the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the likely origin of the late response modulation. Overall these results support the dissociation between the processes underlying the early and late SEP. The later processing stage could involve both direct and indirect thalamic connections to PPC which bypass the postcentral somatosensory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Teixeira et al. report that neurotransmitter release from hippocampal serotonin terminals modulates CA3-to-CA1 excitatory transmission and spatial memory formation. 5-HT4 receptors are centrally involved in relaying both modulatory consequences, supporting the rationale to target this receptor subtype for pharmacotherapy of cognitive impairment.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In this issue of Cerebral Cortex, Cipriani et al. are following up on the recent report of Sorrels et al. to add novel immunohistological observations indicating that, unlike rodents, adult and aging humans do not acquire new neurons in the hippocampus. The common finding emerging from these 2 different, but almost simultaneous studies is highly significant because the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was, until recently, considered as the only structure in the human brain that may continue neurogenesis throughout the full life span.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: RIPK3/MLKL-Mediated Neuronal Necroptosis Modulates the M1/M2 Polarization of Microglia/Macrophages in the Ischemic Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy089</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy089/4994243?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cell death and subsequent inflammation are 2 key pathological changes occurring in cerebral ischemia. Active microglia/macrophages play a double-edged role depending on the balance of their M1/M2 phenotypes. Necrosis is the predominant type of cell death following ischemia. However, how necrotic cells modulate the M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages remains poorly investigated. Here, we reported that ischemia induces a rapid RIPK3/MLKL-mediated neuron-dominated necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Ablating RIPK3 or MLKL could switch the activation of microglia/macrophages from M1 to the M2 type in the ischemic cortex. Conditioned medium of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated wild-type (WT) neurons induced M1 polarization, while that of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons favored M2 polarization. OGD treatment induces proinflammatory IL-18 and TNFα in WT but not in RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which in turn upregulate anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, the expression of Myd88—a common downstream adaptor of toll-like receptors—is significantly upregulated in the microglia/macrophages of ischemic WT but not of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; or MLKL&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cortices. Antagonizing the function of Myd88 could phenocopy the effects of RIPK3/MLKL-knockout on the polarization of microglia/macrophages and was neuroprotective. Our data revealed a novel role of necroptotic neurons in modulating the M1/M2 balance of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic cortex, possibly through Myd88 signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
