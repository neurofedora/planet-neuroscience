	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Riemannian tangent space mapping and elastic net regularization for cost-effective EEG markers of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. (arXiv:1711.08359v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in routine clinical practice is
most commonly based on subjective clinical interpretations. Quantitative
electroencephalography (QEEG) measures have been shown to reflect
neurodegenerative processes in AD and might qualify as affordable and thereby
widely available markers to facilitate the objectivization of AD assessment.
Here, we present a novel framework combining Riemannian tangent space mapping
and elastic net regression for the development of brain atrophy markers. While
most AD QEEG studies are based on small sample sizes and psychological test
scores as outcome measures, here we train and test our models using data of one
of the largest prospective EEG AD trials ever conducted, including MRI
biomarkers of brain atrophy.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Subthreshold signal encoding in coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. (arXiv:1711.08309v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08309</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08309</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite intensive research, the mechanisms underlying how neurons encode
external inputs remain poorly understood. Recent work has focused on the
response of a single neuron to a weak, subthreshold periodic signal. By
simulating the FitzHugh-Nagumo stochastic model and then using a symbolic
method to analyze the firing activity of the neuron, preferred and infrequent
spike patterns (defined by the relative timing of the spikes) were detected,
whose probabilities encode information about the signal. As not individual
neurons in isolation but neuronal populations are responsible for the emergence
of complex behaviors, a relevant question is whether this coding mechanism is
robust when the neuron is not isolated. We study how a second neuron, which
does not perceive the subthreshold signal, affects the detection and the
encoding of the signal, done by the first neuron. Through simulations of two
coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons we show that the coding mechanism is indeed
robust, as the neuron that perceives the signal fires a spike train that has
symbolic patterns whose probabilities depend on the features of the signal.
Moreover, we show that the second neuron facilitates the detection of the
signal, by lowering the firing threshold of the first neuron. This in turn
decreases the internal noise level need to fire the spikes that encode the
signal. We also show that the probabilities of the symbolic patterns achieve
maximum or minimum values when the period of the external signal is close to
(or is half of) the mean firing period of the neuron.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Clonal analysis of newborn hippocampal dentate granule cell proliferation and development in temporal lobe epilepsy. (arXiv:1711.08063v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08063</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08063</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal dentate granule cells are among the few neuronal cell types
generated throughout adult life in mammals. In the normal brain, new granule
cells are generated from progenitors in the subgranular zone and integrate in a
typical fashion. During the development of epilepsy, granule cell integration
is profoundly altered. The new cells migrate to ectopic locations and develop
misoriented basal dendrites. Although it has been established that these
abnormal cells are newly generated, it is not known whether they arise
ubiquitously throughout the progenitor cell pool or are derived from a smaller
number of bad actor progenitors. To explore this question, we conducted a
clonal analysis study in mice expressing the Brainbow fluorescent protein
reporter construct in dentate granule cell progenitors. Mice were examined 2
months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, a treatment that leads to
the development of epilepsy. Brain sections were rendered translucent so that
entire hippocampi could be reconstructed and all fluorescently labeled cells
identified. Our findings reveal that a small number of progenitors produce the
majority of ectopic cells following status epilepticus, indicating that either
the affected progenitors or their local microenvironments have become
pathological. By contrast, granule cells with basal dendrites were equally
distributed among clonal groups. This indicates that these progenitors can
produce normal cells and suggests that global factors sporadically disrupt the
dendritic development of some new cells. Together, these findings strongly
predict that distinct mechanisms regulate different aspects

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous &quot;bump&quot; attractors are an established model of cortical working
memory for continuous variables and can be implemented using various neuron and
network models. Here, we develop a generalizable approach for the approximation
of bump states of continuous attractor networks implemented in networks of both
rate-based and spiking neurons. The method relies on a low-dimensional
parametrization of the spatial shape of firing rates, allowing to apply
efficient numerical optimization methods. Using our theory, we can establish a
mapping between network structure and attractor properties that allows the
prediction of the effects of network parameters on the steady state firing rate
profile and the existence of bumps, and vice-versa, to fine-tune a network to
produce bumps of a given shape.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuronal resonance in the theta (4-10 Hz) frequency range is modulated by dynamic changes in the input resistance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/224253v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Most neurons of the mammalian brain display intrinsic resonance with frequency selectivity (fR) for inputs within the theta-range (4-10 Hz). Variations in network oscillation along this range depend on the animal behavior; however, whether neurons can dynamically tune their fR has not been addressed. Using slice electrophysiology, dynamic clamping and computer modeling we studied three types of cortical neurons, finding that the input resistance (Rin) inversely sets fR into the theta range, following a power law. We demonstrate that physiological changes in Rin modulate fR and response phase, serving as a mechanism that instantaneously tunes oscillatory responses. Moreover, these modulations are translated into spiking regimes, modifying spike frequency and timing. Since synaptic inputs reduce Rin, this modulation provides a mean for adjusting the frequency and timing of firing of individual neurons in interplay with the network fluctuations. This might be a widespread property among resonant neurons.</description>

	<description>Since the middle of the 1990s, studies of resting-state fMRI/BOLD data have explored the correlation patterns of activity across the whole brain, which is referred to as functional connectivity (FC). Among the many methods that have been developed to interpret FC, a recently proposed model-based approach describes the propagation of fluctuating BOLD activity within the recurrently connected brain network by inferring the effective connectivity (EC). In this model, EC quantifies the strengths of directional interactions between brain regions, viewed from the proxy of BOLD activity. In addition, the tuning procedure for the model provides estimates for the local variability (input variances) to explain how the observed FC is generated. Generalizing, the network dynamics can be studied in the context of an input-output mapping - determined by EC - for the second-order statistics of fluctuating nodal activities. The present paper focuses on the following detection paradigm: observing output covariances, how discriminative is the (estimated) network model with respect to various input covariance patterns? An application with the model fitted to experimental fMRI data - movie viewing versus resting state - illustrates that changes in excitability and changes in brain coordination go hand in hand.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Real-Time Tracking of Selective Auditory Attention from M/EEG: A Bayesian Filtering Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/222661v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Humans are able to identify and track a target speaker amid a cacophony of acoustic interference, which is often referred to as the cocktail party phenomenon. Results from several decades of studying this phenomenon have culminated in recent years in various promising attempts to decode the attentional state of a listener in a competing-speaker environment from non-invasive neuroimaging recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, most existing approaches compute correlation-based measures by either regressing the features of each speech stream to the M/EEG channels (the decoding approach) or vice versa (the encoding approach). These procedures operate in an offline fashion, i.e., require the entire duration of the experiment and multiple trials to provide robust results. Therefore, they cannot be used in emerging applications such as smart hearing aid devices, where a single trial must be used in real-time to decode the attentional state. In this paper, we close this gap by developing an algorithmic pipeline for real-time decoding of the attentional state. Our proposed framework consists of three main modules: 1) Real-time and robust estimation of encoding or decoding coefficients, achieved by sparse adaptive filtering, 2) Extracting reliable markers of the attentional state, and thereby generalizing the widely-used correlation-based measures thereof, and 3) Devising a near real-time state-space estimator that translates the noisy and variable attention markers to robust and reliable estimates of the attentional state with minimal delay. Our proposed algorithms integrate various techniques including forgetting factor-based adaptive filtering, l1-regularization, forward-backward splitting algorithms, fixed-lag smoothing, and Expectation Maximization. We validate the performance of our proposed framework using comprehensive simulations as well as application to experimentally acquired M/EEG data. Our results reveal that the proposed real-time algorithms perform nearly as accurate as the existing state-of-the-art offline techniques, while providing a significant degree of adaptivity, statistical robustness, and computational savings.</description>

	<description>In the early developing nervous system, self-renewing neural stem cells are polarized and maintain an apical domain facing a central lumen. The presence of apical membrane is thought to have a profound influence on maintaining the stem cell state. With the onset of neurogenesis cells lose their polarization and the concomitant loss of the apical domain coincides with a loss of the stem cell identity. Very little is known about the molecular signals controlling apical membrane size. Here we use two neuroepithelial cell systems, one derived from regenerating axolotl spinal cord and the other from human ESCs to identify a conserved molecular signalling pathway initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that controls apical membrane size and consequently controls and maintains epithelial organization and lumen size in neuroepithelial rosettes. This apical domain size increase occurs independently of effects on proliferation and involves a SRF-dependent transcriptional induction of junctional and apical membrane components.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sensitivity to Pain Expectations: A Bayesian Model of Individual Differences</title>

	<description>The thoughts and feelings people have about pain (referred to as &quot;Pain expectations&quot;) are known to alter the perception of pain. However we know very little about the cognitive processes that underpin pain expectations, or what drives the differing effect that pain expectations have between individuals. This paper details the testing of a model of pain perception which formalises the response to pain in terms of a Bayesian prior-to-posterior updating process. Using data acquired from a short and deception-free predictive cue task, it was found that this Bayesian model predicted ratings of pain better than other, simpler models. At the group level, the results confirmed two core predictions of Hierarchical Predictive Processing; that expectation alters perception and that increased uncertainty in the expectation reduces its impact on perception. The addition to the model of parameters relating to trait differences in pain expectation, improved its fit, suggesting that such traits (which have been relatively neglected in experimental work on pain perception) play a significant role in perception beyond those expectations triggered by the pain cue. When model parameters were allowed to vary by participant, the fit improved further. This final model produced a characterisation of the sensitivity of each individual to pain expectations. These findings are relevant for the understanding of the cognitive basis of pain expectations, and potentially useful for guiding patient stratification and clinical experimentation.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fragmentation modes and the evolution of life cycles</title>

Reproduction is a defining feature of living systems. To reproduce, aggregates of biological units (e.g., multicellular organisms or colonial bacteria) must fragment into smaller parts. Fragmentation modes in nature range from binary fission in bacteria to collective-level fragmentation and the production of unicellular propagules in multicellular organisms. Despite this apparent ubiquity, the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes has received little attention. Here, we develop a model in which groups arise from the division of single cells that do not separate but stay together until the moment of group fragmentation. We allow for all possible fragmentation patterns and calculate the population growth rate of each associated life cycle. Fragmentation modes that maximise growth rate comprise a restrictive set of patterns that include production of unicellular propagules and division into two similar size groups. Life cycles marked by single-cell bottlenecks maximise population growth rate under a wide range of conditions. This surprising result offers a new evolutionary explanation for the widespread occurrence of this mode of reproduction. All in all, our model provides a framework for exploring the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes and their associated life cycles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wDROTWJQqu0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Right Temporoparietal Junction Supports Speech Tracking During Selective Listening: Evidence from Concurrent EEG-fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11505?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Listening selectively to one out of several competing speakers in a &quot;cocktail party&quot; situation is a highly demanding task. It relies on a widespread cortical network, including auditory sensory, but also frontal and parietal brain regions involved in controlling auditory attention. Previous work has shown that, during selective listening, ongoing neural activity in auditory sensory areas is dominated by the attended speech stream, whereas competing input is suppressed. The relationship between these attentional modulations in the sensory tracking of the attended speech stream and frontoparietal activity during selective listening is, however, not understood. We studied this question in young, healthy human participants (both sexes) using concurrent EEG-fMRI and a sustained selective listening task, in which one out of two competing speech streams had to be attended selectively. An EEG-based speech envelope reconstruction method was applied to assess the strength of the cortical tracking of the to-be-attended and the to-be-ignored stream during selective listening. Our results show that individual speech envelope reconstruction accuracies obtained for the to-be-attended speech stream were positively correlated with the amplitude of sustained BOLD responses in the right temporoparietal junction, a core region of the ventral attention network. This brain region further showed task-related functional connectivity to secondary auditory cortex and regions of the frontoparietal attention network, including the intraparietal sulcus and the inferior frontal gyrus. This suggests that the right temporoparietal junction is involved in controlling attention during selective listening, allowing for a better cortical tracking of the attended speech stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Listening selectively to one out of several simultaneously talking speakers in a &quot;cocktail party&quot; situation is a highly demanding task. It activates a widespread network of auditory sensory and hierarchically higher frontoparietal brain regions. However, how these different processing levels interact during selective listening is not understood. Here, we investigated this question using fMRI and concurrently acquired scalp EEG. We found that activation levels in the right temporoparietal junction correlate with the sensory representation of a selectively attended speech stream. In addition, this region showed significant functional connectivity to both auditory sensory and other frontoparietal brain areas during selective listening. This suggests that the right temporoparietal junction contributes to controlling selective auditory attention in &quot;cocktail party&quot; situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Development of the Visual Word Form Area Requires Visual Experience: Evidence from Blind Braille Readers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11495?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11495?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning to read causes the development of a letter- and word-selective region known as the visual word form area (VWFA) within the human ventral visual object stream. Why does a reading-selective region develop at this anatomical location? According to one hypothesis, the VWFA develops at the nexus of visual inputs from retinotopic cortices and linguistic input from the frontotemporal language network because reading involves extracting linguistic information from visual symbols. Surprisingly, the anatomical location of the VWFA is also active when blind individuals read Braille by touch, suggesting that vision is not required for the development of the VWFA. In this study, we tested the alternative prediction that VWFA development is in fact influenced by visual experience. We predicted that in the absence of vision, the &quot;VWFA&quot; is incorporated into the frontotemporal language network and participates in high-level language processing. Congenitally blind (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10, 9 female, 1 male) and sighted control (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15, 9 female, 6 male), male and female participants each took part in two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments: (1) word reading (Braille for blind and print for sighted participants), and (2) listening to spoken sentences of different grammatical complexity (both groups). We find that in blind, but not sighted participants, the anatomical location of the VWFA responds both to written words and to the grammatical complexity of spoken sentences. This suggests that in blindness, this region takes on high-level linguistic functions, becoming less selective for reading. More generally, the current findings suggest that experience during development has a major effect on functional specialization in the human cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region in the human cortex that becomes specialized for the recognition of written letters and words. Why does this particular brain region become specialized for reading? We tested the hypothesis that the VWFA develops within the ventral visual stream because reading involves extracting linguistic information from visual symbols. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that in congenitally blind Braille readers, but not sighted readers of print, the VWFA region is active during grammatical processing of spoken sentences. These results suggest that visual experience contributes to VWFA specialization, and that different neural implementations of reading are possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GFP-Mutant Human Tau Transgenic Mice Develop Tauopathy Following CNS Injections of Alzheimer's Brain-Derived Pathological Tau or Synthetic Mutant Human Tau Fibrils</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative proteinopathies characterized by intracellular aggregates of tau proteins, termed tauopathies, include Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with tau pathology (FTLD-tau), and related disorders. Pathological tau proteins derived from human AD brains (AD-tau) act as proteopathic seeds that initiate the templated aggregation of soluble tau upon intracerebral injection into tau transgenic (Tg) and wild-type mice, thereby modeling human tau pathology. In this study, we found that aged Tg mice of both sexes expressing human tau proteins harboring a pathogenic P301L &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; mutation labeled with green fluorescent protein (T40PL-GFP Tg mouse line) exhibited hyperphosphorylated tau mislocalized to the somatodentritic domain of neurons, but these mice did not develop &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; insoluble tau aggregates, which are characteristic of human AD and related tauopathies. However, intracerebral injections of either T40PL preformed fibrils (PFFs) or AD-tau seeds into T40PL-GFP mice induced abundant intraneuronal pathological inclusions of hyperphosphorylated T40PL-GFP. These injections of pathological tau resulted in the propagation of tau pathology from the injection site to neuroanatomically connected brain regions, and these tau inclusions consisted of both T40PL-GFP and WT endogenous mouse tau. Primary neurons cultured from the brains of neonatal T40PL-GFP mice provided an informative &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model for examining the uptake and localization of tau PFFs. These findings demonstrate the seeded aggregation of T40PL-GFP &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by synthetic PFFs and human AD-tau and the utility of this system to study the neuropathological spread of tau aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The stereotypical spread of pathological tau protein aggregates have recently been attributed to the transmission of proteopathic seeds. Despite the extensive use of transgenic mouse models to investigate the propagation of tau pathology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, details of the aggregation process such as the early seeding events leading to new tau pathology have remained elusive. This study validates the use of GFP-labeled tau expressed by neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; as models for investigating mechanisms underlying the seeded transmission of tau pathology as well as tau-focused drug discovery to identify disease-modifying therapies for AD and related tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Domain Specificity of Oculomotor Learning after Changes in Sensory Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11469?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans visually process the world with varying spatial resolution and can program their eye movements optimally to maximize information acquisition for a variety of everyday tasks. Diseases such as macular degeneration can change visual sensory processing, introducing central vision loss (a scotoma). However, humans can learn to direct a new preferred retinal location to regions of interest for simple visual tasks. Whether such learned compensatory saccades are optimal and generalize to more complex tasks, which require integrating information across a large area of the visual field, is not well understood. Here, we explore the possible effects of central vision loss on the optimal saccades during a face identification task, using a gaze-contingent simulated scotoma. We show that a new foveated ideal observer with a central scotoma correctly predicts that the human optimal point of fixation to identify faces shifts from just below the eyes to one that is at the tip of the nose and another at the top of the forehead. However, even after 5000 trials, humans of both sexes surprisingly do not change their initial fixations to adapt to the new optimal fixation points to faces. In contrast, saccades do change for tasks such as object following and to a lesser extent during search. Our findings argue against a central brain motor-compensatory mechanism that generalizes across tasks. They instead suggest task specificity in the learning of oculomotor plans in response to changes in front-end sensory processing and the possibility of separate domain-specific representations of learned oculomotor plans in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanism by which humans adapt eye movements in response to central vision loss is still not well understood and carries importance for gaining a fundamental understanding of brain plasticity. We show that although humans adapt their eye movements for simpler tasks such as object following and search, these adaptations do not generalize to more complex tasks such as face identification. We provide the first computational model to predict where humans with central vision loss should direct their eye movements in face identification tasks, which could become a critical tool in making patient-specific recommendations. Based on these results, we suggest a novel theory for oculomotor learning: a distributed representation of learned eye-movement plans represented in domain-specific areas of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Concerted Interneuron Activity in the Cerebellar Molecular Layer During Rhythmic Oromotor Behaviors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11455?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Molecular layer interneurons (MLIs, stellate and basket cells) of the cerebellar cortex are linked together by chemical and electrical synapses and exert a potent feedforward inhibition on Purkinje cells. The functional role of MLIs during specific motor tasks is uncertain. Here, we used two-photon imaging to study the patterns of activity of neighboring individual MLIs in the Crus II region of awake female mice during two types of oromotor activity, licking and bruxing, using specific expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator protein GCaMP6s. We found that both stellate and basket cells engaged in synchronized waves of calcium activity during licking and bruxing, with high degrees of correlation among the signals collected in individual MLIs. In contrast, no calcium activity was observed during whisking. MLI activity tended to lag behind the onset of sustained licking episodes, indicating a regulatory action of MLIs during licking. Furthermore, during licking, stellate cell activity was anisotropic: the coordination was constant along the direction of parallel fibers (PFs), but fell off with distance along the orthogonal direction. These results suggest a PF drive for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals during licking. In contrast, during bruxing, MLI activity was neither clearly organized spatially nor temporally correlated with oromotor activity. In conclusion, MLI activity exhibits a high degree of correlation both in licking and in bruxing, but spatiotemporal patterns of activity display significant differences for the two types of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is known that, during movement, the activity of molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex is enhanced. However, MLI–MLI interactions are complex because they depend both from excitatory electrical synapses and from potentially inhibitory chemical synapses. Accordingly, the pattern of MLI activity during movement has been unclear. Here, during two oromotor tasks, licking and bruxism, individual neighboring MLIs displayed highly coordinated activity, showing that the positive influences binding MLIs together are predominant. We further find that spatiotemporal patterns differ between licking and bruxing, suggesting that the precise pattern of MLI activity depends on the nature of the motor task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Seizures and Sleep in the Thalamus: Focal Limbic Seizures Show Divergent Activity Patterns in Different Thalamic Nuclei</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11441?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11441?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The thalamus plays diverse roles in cortical-subcortical brain activity patterns. Recent work suggests that focal temporal lobe seizures depress subcortical arousal systems and convert cortical activity into a pattern resembling slow-wave sleep. The potential simultaneous and paradoxical role of the thalamus in both limbic seizure propagation, and in sleep-like cortical rhythms has not been investigated. We recorded neuronal activity from the central lateral (CL), anterior (ANT), and ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei of the thalamus in an established female rat model of focal limbic seizures. We found that population firing of neurons in CL decreased during seizures while the cortex exhibited slow waves. In contrast, ANT showed a trend toward increased neuronal firing compatible with polyspike seizure discharges seen in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, VPM exhibited a remarkable increase in sleep spindles during focal seizures. Single-unit juxtacellular recordings from CL demonstrated reduced overall firing rates, but a switch in firing pattern from single spikes to burst firing during seizures. These findings suggest that different thalamic nuclei play very different roles in focal limbic seizures. While limbic nuclei, such as ANT, appear to participate directly in seizure propagation, arousal nuclei, such as CL, may contribute to depressed cortical function, whereas sleep spindles in relay nuclei, such as VPM, may interrupt thalamocortical information flow. These combined effects could be critical for controlling both seizure severity and impairment of consciousness. Further understanding of differential effects of seizures on different thalamocortical networks may lead to improved treatments directly targeting these modes of impaired function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Temporal lobe epilepsy has a major negative impact on quality of life. Previous work suggests that the thalamus plays a critical role in thalamocortical network modulation and subcortical arousal maintenance, but its precise seizure-associated functions are not known. We recorded neuronal activity in three different thalamic regions and found divergent activity patterns, which may respectively participate in seizure propagation, impaired level of conscious arousal, and altered relay of information to the cortex during focal limbic seizures. These very different activity patterns within the thalamus may help explain why focal temporal lobe seizures often disrupt widespread network function, and can help guide future treatments aimed at restoring normal thalamocortical network activity and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain perception is strongly influenced by descending pathways from &quot;higher&quot; brain centers that regulate the activity of spinal circuits. In addition to the extensively studied descending system originating from the medulla, the neocortex provides dense anatomical projections that directly target neurons in the spinal cord and the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (SpVc). Evidence exists that these corticotrigeminal pathways may modulate the processing of nociceptive inputs by SpVc, and regulate pain perception. We demonstrate here, with anatomical and optogenetic methods, and using both rats and mice (of both sexes), that corticotrigeminal axons densely innervate SpVc, where they target and directly activate inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that stimulation of primary somatosensory cortex potently suppresses SpVc responses to noxious stimuli and produces behavioral hypoalgesia. These findings demonstrate that the corticotrigeminal pathway is a potent modulator of nociception and a potential target for interventions to alleviate chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many chronic pain conditions are resistant to conventional therapy. Promising new approaches to pain management capitalize on the brain's own mechanisms for controlling pain perception. Here we demonstrate that cortical neurons directly innervate the brainstem to drive feedforward inhibition of nociceptive neurons. This corticotrigeminal pathway suppresses the activity of these neurons and produces analgesia. This corticotrigeminal pathway may constitute a therapeutic target for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Subconscious Interaction between Fixation and Anticipatory Pursuit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11424?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11424?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ocular smooth pursuit and fixation are typically viewed as separate systems, yet there is evidence that the brainstem fixation system inhibits pursuit. Here we present behavioral evidence that the fixation system modulates pursuit behavior outside of conscious awareness. Human observers (male and female) either pursued a small spot that translated across a screen, or fixated it as it remained stationary. As shown previously, pursuit trials potentiated the oculomotor system, producing anticipatory eye velocity on the next trial before the target moved that mimicked the stimulus-driven velocity. Randomly interleaving fixation trials reduced anticipatory pursuit, suggesting that a potentiated fixation system interacted with pursuit to suppress eye velocity in upcoming pursuit trials. The reduction was not due to passive decay of the potentiated pursuit signal because interleaving &quot;blank&quot; trials in which no target appeared did not reduce anticipatory pursuit. Interspersed short fixation trials reduced anticipation on long pursuit trials, suggesting that fixation potentiation was stronger than pursuit potentiation. Furthermore, adding more pursuit trials to a block did not restore anticipatory pursuit, suggesting that fixation potentiation was not overridden by certainty of an imminent pursuit trial but rather was immune to conscious intervention. To directly test whether cognition can override fixation suppression, we alternated pursuit and fixation trials to perfectly specify trial identity. Still, anticipatory pursuit did not rise above that observed with an equal number of random fixation trials. The results suggest that potentiated fixation circuitry interacts with pursuit circuitry at a subconscious level to inhibit pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When an object moves, we view it with smooth pursuit eye movements. When an object is stationary, we view it with fixational eye movements. Pursuit and fixation are historically regarded as controlled by different neural circuitry, and alternating between invoking them is thought to be guided by a conscious decision. However, our results show that pursuit is actively suppressed by prior fixation of a stationary object. This suppression is involuntary, and cannot be avoided even if observers are certain that the object will move. The results suggest that the neural fixation circuitry is potentiated by engaging stationary objects, and interacts with pursuit outside of conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pathological Tau Strains from Human Brains Recapitulate the Diversity of Tauopathies in Nontransgenic Mouse Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pathological tau aggregates occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative tauopathies. It is not clearly understood why tauopathies vary greatly in the neuroanatomical and histopathological patterns of tau aggregation, which contribute to clinical heterogeneity in these disorders. Recent studies have shown that tau aggregates may form distinct structural conformations, known as tau strains. Here, we developed a novel model to test the hypothesis that cell-to-cell transmission of different tau strains occurs in nontransgenic (non-Tg) mice, and to investigate whether there are strain-specific differences in the pattern of tau transmission. By injecting pathological tau extracted from postmortem brains of AD (AD-tau), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP-tau), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD-tau) patients into different brain regions of female non-Tg mice, we demonstrated the induction and propagation of endogenous mouse tau aggregates. Specifically, we identified differences in tau strain potency between AD-tau, CBD-tau, and PSP-tau in non-Tg mice. Moreover, differences in cell-type specificity of tau aggregate transmission were observed between tau strains such that only PSP-tau and CBD-tau strains induce astroglial and oligodendroglial tau inclusions, recapitulating the diversity of neuropathology in human tauopathies. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the neuronal connectome, but not the tau strain, determines which brain regions develop tau pathology. Finally, CBD-tau- and PSP-tau-injected mice showed spatiotemporal transmission of glial tau pathology, suggesting glial tau transmission contributes to the progression of tauopathies. Together, our data suggest that different tau strains determine seeding potency and cell-type specificity of tau aggregation that underlie the diversity of human tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Tauopathies show great clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity, despite the fact that tau aggregates in each disease. This heterogeneity could be due to tau aggregates forming distinct structural conformations, or strains. We now report the development of a sporadic tauopathy model to study human tau strains by intracerebrally injecting nontransgenic mice with pathological tau enriched from human tauopathy brains. We show human tau strains seed different types and cellular distributions of tau neuropathology in our model that recapitulate the heterogeneity seen in these human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Serotonin Decreases the Gain of Visual Responses in Awake Macaque V1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin, an important neuromodulator in the brain, is implicated in affective and cognitive functions. However, its role even for basic cortical processes is controversial. For example, in the mammalian primary visual cortex (V1), heterogenous serotonergic modulation has been observed in anesthetized animals. Here, we combined extracellular single-unit recordings with iontophoresis in awake animals. We examined the role of serotonin on well-defined tuning properties (orientation, spatial frequency, contrast, and size) in V1 of two male macaque monkeys. We find that in the awake macaque the modulatory effect of serotonin is surprisingly uniform: it causes a mainly multiplicative decrease of the visual responses and a slight increase in the stimulus-selective response latency. Moreover, serotonin neither systematically changes the selectivity or variability of the response, nor the interneuronal correlation unexplained by the stimulus (&quot;noise-correlation&quot;). The modulation by serotonin has qualitative similarities with that for a decrease in stimulus contrast, but differs quantitatively from decreasing contrast. It can be captured by a simple additive change to a threshold-linear spiking nonlinearity. Together, our results show that serotonin is well suited to control the response gain of neurons in V1 depending on the animal's behavioral or motivational context, complementing other known state-dependent gain-control mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Serotonin is an important neuromodulator in the brain and a major target for drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about how it shapes information processing in sensory areas. Here we examined the serotonergic modulation of visual processing in the primary visual cortex of awake behaving macaque monkeys. We found that serotonin mainly decreased the gain of the visual responses, without systematically changing their selectivity, variability, or covariability. This identifies a simple computational function of serotonin for state-dependent sensory processing, depending on the animal's affective or motivational state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Presynaptic Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors Differentially Shape Select Inputs to Auditory Thalamus and Are Negatively Impacted by Aging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine (ACh) is a potent neuromodulator capable of modifying patterns of acoustic information flow. In auditory cortex, cholinergic systems have been shown to increase salience/gain while suppressing extraneous information. However, the mechanism by which cholinergic circuits shape signal processing in the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) is poorly understood. The present study, in male Fischer Brown Norway rats, seeks to determine the location and function of presynaptic neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) at the major inputs to MGB and characterize how nAChRs change during aging. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological/optogenetic methods were used to examine responses of MGB neurons after activation of nAChRs during a paired-pulse paradigm. Presynaptic nAChR activation increased responses evoked by stimulation of excitatory corticothalamic and inhibitory tectothalamic terminals. Conversely, nAChR activation appeared to have little effect on evoked responses from inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus and excitatory tectothalamic terminals. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization data showed nAChR subunit transcripts in GABAergic inferior colliculus neurons and glutamatergic auditory cortical neurons supporting the present slice findings. Responses to nAChR activation at excitatory corticothalamic and inhibitory tectothalamic inputs were diminished by aging. These findings suggest that cholinergic input to the MGB increases the strength of tectothalamic inhibitory projections, potentially improving the signal-to-noise ratio and signal detection while increasing corticothalamic gain, which may facilitate top-down identification of stimulus identity. These mechanisms appear to be affected negatively by aging, potentially diminishing speech perception in noisy environments. Cholinergic inputs to the MGB appear to maximize sensory processing by adjusting both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in conditions of attention and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is the source of cholinergic innervation for sensory thalamus and is a critical part of an ascending arousal system that controls the firing mode of thalamic cells based on attentional demand. The present study describes the location and impact of aging on presynaptic neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) within the circuitry of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB). We show that nAChRs are located on ascending inhibitory and descending excitatory presynaptic inputs onto MGB neurons, likely increasing gain selectively and improving temporal clarity. In addition, we show that aging has a deleterious effect on nAChR efficacy. Cholinergic dysfunction at the level of MGB may affect speech understanding negatively in the elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Parkinson's Disease-Associated LRRK2 Hyperactive Kinase Mutant Disrupts Synaptic Vesicle Trafficking in Ventral Midbrain Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11366?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized pathologically by the selective loss of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons. Recent evidence has suggested a role of LRRK2, linked to the most frequent familial PD, in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking. However, the mechanism whereby LRRK2 mutants contribute to nigral vulnerability remains unclear. Here we show that the most common PD mutation &lt;i&gt;LRRK2 G2019S&lt;/i&gt; impairs SV endocytosis in ventral midbrain (MB) neurons, including DA neurons, and the slowed endocytosis can be rescued by inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity. A similar endocytic defect, however, was not observed in LRRK2 mutant neurons from the neocortex (hereafter, cortical neurons) or the hippocampus, suggesting a brain region-specific vulnerability to the G2019S mutation. Additionally, we found MB-specific impairment of SV endocytosis in neurons carrying heterozygous deletion of &lt;i&gt;SYNJ1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PARK20&lt;/i&gt;), a gene that is associated with recessive Parkinsonism. Combining &lt;i&gt;SYNJ1&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LRRK2 G2019S&lt;/i&gt; does not exacerbate SV endocytosis but impairs sustained exocytosis in MB neurons and alters specific motor functions of 1-year-old male mice. Interestingly, we show that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates synaptojanin1 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in the disruption of endophilin-synaptojanin1 interaction required for SV endocytosis. Our work suggests a merge of &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SYNJ1&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic pathways in deregulating SV trafficking in MB neurons as an underlying molecular mechanism of early PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron-selective vulnerability in PD is essential for the development of targeted therapeutics. We report, for the first time, a nerve terminal impairment in SV trafficking selectively in MB neurons but not cortical neurons caused by two PARK genes: &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; (PARK8) and &lt;i&gt;SYNJ1&lt;/i&gt; (PARK20). We demonstrate that the enhanced kinase activity resulting from the most frequent &lt;i&gt;G2019S&lt;/i&gt; mutation in &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; is the key to this impairment. We provide evidence suggesting that &lt;i&gt;LRRK2 G2019S&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SYNJ1&lt;/i&gt; loss of function share a similar pathogenic pathway in deregulating DAergic neuron SV endocytosis and that they play additive roles in facilitating each other's pathogenic functions in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gaze-Stabilizing Central Vestibular Neurons Project Asymmetrically to Extraocular Motoneuron Pools</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11353?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within reflex circuits, specific anatomical projections allow central neurons to relay sensations to effectors that generate movements. A major challenge is to relate anatomical features of central neural populations, such as asymmetric connectivity, to the computations the populations perform. To address this problem, we mapped the anatomy, modeled the function, and discovered a new behavioral role for a genetically defined population of central vestibular neurons in rhombomeres 5–7 of larval zebrafish. First, we found that neurons within this central population project preferentially to motoneurons that move the eyes downward. Concordantly, when the entire population of asymmetrically projecting neurons was stimulated collectively, only downward eye rotations were observed, demonstrating a functional correlate of the anatomical bias. When these neurons are ablated, fish failed to rotate their eyes following either nose-up or nose-down body tilts. This asymmetrically projecting central population thus participates in both upward and downward gaze stabilization. In addition to projecting to motoneurons, central vestibular neurons also receive direct sensory input from peripheral afferents. To infer whether asymmetric projections can facilitate sensory encoding or motor output, we modeled differentially projecting sets of central vestibular neurons. Whereas motor command strength was independent of projection allocation, asymmetric projections enabled more accurate representation of nose-up stimuli. The model shows how asymmetric connectivity could enhance the representation of imbalance during nose-up postures while preserving gaze stabilization performance. Finally, we found that central vestibular neurons were necessary for a vital behavior requiring maintenance of a nose-up posture: swim bladder inflation. These observations suggest that asymmetric connectivity in the vestibular system facilitates representation of ethologically relevant stimuli without compromising reflexive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Interneuron populations use specific anatomical projections to transform sensations into reflexive actions. Here we examined how the anatomical composition of a genetically defined population of balance interneurons in the larval zebrafish relates to the computations it performs. First, we found that the population of interneurons that stabilize gaze preferentially project to motoneurons that move the eyes downward. Next, we discovered through modeling that such projection patterns can enhance the encoding of nose-up sensations without compromising gaze stabilization. Finally, we found that loss of these interneurons impairs a vital behavior, swim bladder inflation, that relies on maintaining a nose-up posture. These observations suggest that anatomical specialization permits neural circuits to represent relevant features of the environment without compromising behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1/5s) are critical to synapse formation and participate in synaptic LTP and LTD in the brain. mGlu1/5 signaling alterations have been documented in cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative disorders, and psychiatric diseases, but underlying mechanisms for its modulation are not clear. Here, we report that transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), a transmembrane protein of the clathrin complex, modulates the trafficking of mGlu1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) from male mice. We show that conditional knock-out of TFR1 in PCs does not affect the cytoarchitecture of PCs, but reduces mGlu1 expression at synapses. This regulation by TFR1 acts in concert with that by Rab8 and Rab11, which modulate the internalization and recycling of mGlu1, respectively. TFR1 can bind to Rab proteins and facilitate their expression at synapses. PC ablation of TFR1 inhibits parallel fiber–PC LTD, whereas parallel fiber–LTP and PC intrinsic excitability are not affected. Finally, we demonstrate that PC ablation of TFR1 impairs motor coordination, but does not affect social behaviors in mice. Together, these findings underscore the importance of TFR1 in regulating mGlu1 trafficking and suggest that mGlu1- and mGlu1-dependent parallel fiber–LTD are associated with regulation of motor coordination, but not autistic behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu1/5) signaling alterations have been documented in cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative disorders, and psychiatric diseases. Recent work suggests that altered mGlu1 signaling in Purkinje cells (PCs) may be involved in not only motor learning, but also autistic-like behaviors. We find that conditional knock-out of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) in PCs reduces synaptic mGlu1 by tethering Rab8 and Rab11 in the cytosol. PC ablation of TFR1 inhibits parallel fiber–PC LTD, whereas parallel fiber–PC LTP and PC intrinsic excitability are intact. Motor coordination is impaired, but social behaviors are normal in TFR1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;;pCP2-cre mice. Our data reveal a new regulator for trafficking and synaptic expression of mGlu1 and suggest that mGlu1-dependent LTD is associated with motor coordination, but not autistic-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An {alpha}II Spectrin-Based Cytoskeleton Protects Large-Diameter Myelinated Axons from Degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11323?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axons must withstand mechanical forces, including tension, torsion, and compression. Spectrins and actin form a periodic cytoskeleton proposed to protect axons against these forces. However, because spectrins also participate in assembly of axon initial segments (AISs) and nodes of Ranvier, it is difficult to uncouple their roles in maintaining axon integrity from their functions at AIS and nodes. To overcome this problem and to determine the importance of spectrin cytoskeletons for axon integrity, we generated mice with αII spectrin-deficient peripheral sensory neurons. The axons of these neurons are very long and exposed to the mechanical forces associated with limb movement; most lack an AIS, and some are unmyelinated and have no nodes. We analyzed αII spectrin-deficient mice of both sexes and found that, in myelinated axons, αII spectrin forms a periodic cytoskeleton with βIV and βII spectrin at nodes of Ranvier and paranodes, respectively, but that loss of αII spectrin disrupts this organization. &lt;i&gt;Avil-cre;Sptan1&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice have reduced numbers of nodes, disrupted paranodal junctions, and mislocalized Kv1 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. We show that the density of nodal βIV spectrin is constant among axons, but the density of nodal αII spectrin increases with axon diameter. Remarkably, &lt;i&gt;Avil-cre;Sptan1&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice have intact nociception and small-diameter axons, but severe ataxia due to preferential degeneration of large-diameter myelinated axons. Our results suggest that nodal αII spectrin helps resist the mechanical forces experienced by large-diameter axons, and that αII spectrin-dependent cytoskeletons are also required for assembly of nodes of Ranvier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A periodic axonal cytoskeleton consisting of actin and spectrin has been proposed to help axons resist the mechanical forces to which they are exposed (e.g., compression, torsion, and stretch). However, until now, no vertebrate animal model has tested the requirement of the spectrin cytoskeleton in maintenance of axon integrity. We demonstrate the role of the periodic spectrin-dependent cytoskeleton in axons and show that loss of αII spectrin from PNS axons causes preferential degeneration of large-diameter myelinated axons. We show that nodal αII spectrin is found at greater densities in large-diameter myelinated axons, suggesting that nodes are particularly vulnerable domains requiring a specialized cytoskeleton to protect against axon degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}II Spectrin Forms a Periodic Cytoskeleton at the Axon Initial Segment and Is Required for Nervous System Function</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spectrins form a submembranous cytoskeleton proposed to confer strength and flexibility to neurons and to participate in ion channel clustering at axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier. Neuronal spectrin cytoskeletons consist of diverse β subunits and αII spectrin. Although αII spectrin is found in neurons in both axonal and somatodendritic domains, using proteomics, biochemistry, and superresolution microscopy, we show that αII and βIV spectrin interact and form a periodic AIS cytoskeleton. To determine the role of spectrins in the nervous system, we generated &lt;i&gt;Sptan1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt; mice for deletion of CNS αII spectrin. We analyzed αII spectrin-deficient mice of both sexes and found that loss of αII spectrin causes profound reductions in all β spectrins. αII spectrin-deficient mice die before 1 month of age and have disrupted AIS and many other neurological impairments including seizures, disrupted cortical lamination, and widespread neurodegeneration. These results demonstrate the importance of the spectrin cytoskeleton both at the AIS and throughout the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spectrin cytoskeletons play diverse roles in neurons, including assembly of excitable domains such as the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier. However, the molecular composition and structure of these cytoskeletons remain poorly understood. Here, we show that αII spectrin partners with βIV spectrin to form a periodic cytoskeleton at the AIS. Using a new αII spectrin conditional knock-out mouse, we show that αII spectrin is required for AIS assembly, neuronal excitability, cortical lamination, and to protect against neurodegeneration. These results demonstrate the broad importance of spectrin cytoskeletons for nervous system function and development and have important implications for nervous system injuries and diseases because disruption of the spectrin cytoskeleton is a common molecular pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Delayed Maturation of Fast-Spiking Interneurons Is Rectified by Activation of the TrkB Receptor in the Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/47/11298?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability, and the most common known cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is broadly characterized by sensory hypersensitivity and several developmental alterations in synaptic and circuit function have been uncovered in the sensory cortex of the mouse model of FXS (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO). GABA-mediated neurotransmission and fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons are central to cortical circuit development in the neonate. Here we demonstrate that there is a delay in the maturation of the intrinsic properties of FS interneurons in the sensory cortex, and a deficit in the formation of excitatory synaptic inputs on to these neurons in neonatal &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Both these delays in neuronal and synaptic maturation were rectified by chronic administration of a TrkB receptor agonist. These results demonstrate that the maturation of the GABAergic circuit in the sensory cortex is altered during a critical developmental period due in part to a perturbation in BDNF-TrkB signaling, and could contribute to the alterations in cortical development underlying the sensory pathophysiology of FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fragile X (FXS) individuals have a range of sensory related phenotypes, and there is growing evidence of alterations in neuronal circuits in the sensory cortex of the mouse model of FXS (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO). GABAergic interneurons are central to the correct formation of circuits during cortical critical periods. Here we demonstrate a delay in the maturation of the properties and synaptic connectivity of interneurons in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice during a critical period of cortical development. The delays both in cellular and synaptic maturation were rectified by administration of a TrkB receptor agonist, suggesting reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling as a contributing factor. These results provide evidence that the function of fast-spiking interneurons is disrupted due to a deficiency in neurotrophin signaling during early development in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of 141 PET and SPECT studies that have investigated striatal presynaptic dopamine function in Parkinson's disease (PD) was performed. Subregional estimates of striatal dopamine metabolism are presented. The aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) defect appears to be consistently smaller than the dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) defects, suggesting up-regulation of AADC function in PD. The correlation between disease severity and dopamine loss appears linear but the majority of longitudinal studies point to a negative exponential progression pattern of dopamine loss in PD.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantifying Performance of Bipedal Standing with Multi-channel EMG. (arXiv:1711.07894v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation has enabled humans with motor complete spinal cord
injury (SCI) to independently stand and recover some lost autonomic function.
Quantifying the quality of bipedal standing under spinal stimulation is
important for spinal rehabilitation therapies and for new strategies that seek
to combine spinal stimulation and rehabilitative robots (such as exoskeletons)
in real time feedback. To study the potential for automated electromyography
(EMG) analysis in SCI, we evaluated the standing quality of paralyzed patients
undergoing electrical spinal cord stimulation using both video and
multi-channel surface EMG recordings during spinal stimulation therapy
sessions. The quality of standing under different stimulation settings was
quantified manually by experienced clinicians. By correlating features of the
recorded EMG activity with the expert evaluations, we show that multi-channel
EMG recording can provide accurate, fast, and robust estimation for the quality
of bipedal standing in spinally stimulated SCI patients. Moreover, our analysis
shows that the total number of EMG channels needed to effectively predict
standing quality can be reduced while maintaining high estimation accuracy,
which provides more flexibility for rehabilitation robotic systems to
incorporate EMG recordings.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Hierarchical internal representation of spectral features in deep convolutional networks trained for EEG decoding. (arXiv:1711.07792v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07792</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07792</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, there is increasing interest and research on the interpretability
of machine learning models, for example how they transform and internally
represent EEG signals in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This can
help to understand the limits of the model and how it may be improved, in
addition to possibly provide insight about the data itself. Schirrmeister et
al. (2017) have recently reported promising results for EEG decoding with deep
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) trained in an end-to-end manner and,
with a causal visualization approach, showed that they learn to use spectral
amplitude changes in the input. In this study, we investigate how ConvNets
represent spectral features through the sequence of intermediate stages of the
network. We show higher sensitivity to EEG phase features at earlier stages and
higher sensitivity to EEG amplitude features at later stages. Intriguingly, we
observed a specialization of individual stages of the network to the classical
EEG frequency bands alpha, beta, and high gamma. Furthermore, we find first
evidence that particularly in the later layer, the network learns to detect
more complex oscillatory patterns beyond spectral phase and amplitude,
reminiscent of the representation of complex visual features in later layer of
ConvNets in computer vision tasks. Our findings thus provide insights into how
ConvNets hierarchically represent spectral EEG features in their intermediate
layers and suggest that ConvNets can exploit and might help to better
understand the compositional structure of EEG time series.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The temporal evolution of conceptual object representations revealed through models of behavior, semantics and deep neural networks</title>

	<description>Visual object representations are commonly thought to emerge rapidly, yet it has remained unclear to what extent early brain responses reflect purely low-level visual features of these objects and how strongly those features contribute to later categorical or conceptual representations. Here, we aimed to estimate a lower temporal bound for the emergence of conceptual representations by defining two criteria that characterize such representations: 1) conceptual object representations should generalize across different exemplars of the same object, and 2) these representations should reflect high-level behavioral judgments. To test these criteria, we compared magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings between two groups of participants (n = 16 per group) exposed to different exemplar images of the same object concepts. Further, we disentangled low-level from high-level MEG responses by estimating the unique and shared contribution of models of behavioral judgments, semantics, and different layers of deep neural networks of visual object processing. We find that 1) both generalization across exemplars as well as generalization of object-related signals across time increase after 150 ms, peaking around 230 ms; 2) behavioral judgments explain the most unique variance in the response after 150 ms. Collectively, these results suggest a lower bound for the emergence of conceptual object representations around 150 ms following stimulus onset.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Immediate effects of psychosocial stress on attention depend on subjective experience and not directly on stress-related physiological changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223909v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223909v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Acute psychosocial stress is associated with physiological, subjective and cognitive changes. In particular, attention, which is considered one of the main processes driving cognition, has been related to different stress outcomes, such as anxiety, cortisol levels and autonomic responses, individually. Nonetheless, their specific contributions to and association with attention is still not fully understood. To study this association, 42 male participants were asked to perform an attentional task just before and immediately after being exposed to either an experimental treatment designed to induce psychosocial stress using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) or a matching stress-free control condition. The salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate, and self-reported anxiety were measured to assess the physiological response to stress and the subjective experience during the protocol. As expected, psychosocial stress induced increases in heart rate, salivary cortisol levels and anxiety. The behavioral analysis revealed that members of the control group performed better on the attentional task after the protocol, while members of the TSST group showed no changes. Moreover, after dividing the stress group into sub-groups of participants with high and low anxiety, we observed that participants in the high-anxiety group not only failed to perform better but also performed worse. Finally, after testing several single-level mediation models, we found that anxiety is sufficient to explain the changes in attention and that it mediates the effects between heart rate and cortisol levels on attention. Our results suggest that the immediate effects of acute psychosocial stress on attention are highly dependent on the participant's subjective experience, which, in turn, is affected and can mediate stress-related physiological changes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cerebral Autoregulation, CSF outflow resistance and outcome following CSF diversion in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223867v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223867v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Introduction: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is not simply the result of a disturbance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, but often includes cardiovascular comorbidity and abnormalities within the cerebral mantle. In this study, we have examined the relationship between the global autoregulation pressure reactivity index (PRx), the profile of disturbed CSF circulation and pressure-volume compensation, and their possible effects on outcome after surgery. Materials and methods: We studied a cohort of 131 patients, investigated for possible NPH. Parameters describing CSF compensation and circulation were calculated during the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion test and PRx was calculated from CSF pressure and arterial pressure recordings. A simple scale was used to mark the patients' outcome 6 months after surgery (improvement, temporary improvement, and no improvement). Results: PRx was negatively correlated with Rout (R=-0.18; p=0.044); patients with normal CSF circulation tended to have worse autoregulation. The correlation for patients who were surgically- managed (N=83) was: R=-0.28; p=0.03, and stronger in patients who improved after surgery (N=64; R=-0.36; p=0.03). In patients who did not improve, the correlation was not significantly different from zero (N= 19; R=0.17; p=0.15). There was a trend towards higher values for PRx in non-responders than in responders (PRx =0.16+/- 0.04 vs 0.09 +/-0.02 respectively; p=0.061), associated with higher MAP values (107.2+/-8.2 in non-responders vs 89.5+/-3.5 in responders; p=0.195). The product of MAP* (1+PRx), proposed as a measure of combined arterial hypertension and deranged autoregulation, showed a significant association with outcome (greater value in non-responders; p=0.013). Conclusion: Autoregulation proves to associate with cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and appears strongest in shunt responders. Outcome following CSF diversion is possibly most favorable when CSF outflow resistance is increased and global cerebral autoregulation is intact, in combination with arterial normotension.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Task-dependent modulation of spinal and transcortical stretch reflexes linked to motor learning rate</title>

	<description>It is generally believed that task-dependent control of body configuration (posture) is achieved by adjusting voluntary motor activity and transcortical &quot;long-latency&quot; reflexes. Spinal monosynaptic circuits are thought not to be engaged in such task-level control. Similarly, being in a state of motor learning has been strongly associated only with an upregulation of feedback responses at transcortical latencies and beyond. In two separate experiments, the current study examined the task-dependent modulation of stretch reflexes by perturbing the hand of human subjects while they were waiting for a &quot;Go&quot; signal to move at the different stages of a classic kinematic learning task (visuomotor rotation). Although the subjects had to resist all haptic perturbations equally, the study leveraged that task-dependent feedback controllers may already be loaded at the movement anticipation stage. In addition to an upregulation of short- and long-latency reflex gains during early exposure to the visual distortion, I found a relative inhibition of reflex responses in the &quot;washout&quot; stage (sensory realignment state). For more distal muscles (brachioradialis), this inhibition also extended to the monosynaptic reflex response (R1). These R1 gains reflected individual motor learning performance in the visuomotor task. The results demonstrate that the systems control policy in visuomotor adaptation can also include inhibition of proprioceptive reflexes, and that aspects of this policy can affect monosynaptic spinal circuits. The latter finding suggests a novel form of state-related control, probably realized by independent control of fusimotor neurons, through which segmental circuits can tune to higher-level features of a sensorimotor task.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Advanced NeuroGPS-Tree: dense reconstruction of brain-wideneuronal population close to ground truth</title>

	<description>Neuron is the basic structure and functional unit of the brain, its projection and connections with other neurons provide a basic physical infrastructure for neural signal storage, allocation, processing, and integration. Recent technique progresses allow for labeling and imaging specific neuronal populations at single axonal level across a whole mouse brain. However, digital reconstruction of these neuron individuals needs months of human labor or sometimes is even an impossible task. Here we developed a software tool, Advanced NeuroGPS-Tree (AdTree), to solve this problem. AdTree offers a special error screening system to achieve reconstruction close to the round truth. Moreover, AdTree equips with algorithms significantly reduces intense manual interferences and achieves high-level automated reconstruction. We demonstrated using AdTree to get almost complete reconstruction from basal dendrites to far-end axonal terminals on dense datasets that challenge state-of-the-art software tools, and even the manual reconstruction with commercial software, whose accuracy is well acknowledged. We also demonstrated about 5 times speed faster over commercial software in brain-wide reconstruction. In addition, AdTree is applicable on datasets collected with different types of light microscopies such as confocal, two-photon, and light-sheet and serial sectioning wide-field tomography. This tool will provide a starting point to reconstruct neuronal population for cell type, circuit, and neurocomputing studies at single cell level.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of background and contour luminance on the hue and brightness of the Watercolor effect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223792v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223792v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We used a conjoint measurement paradigm to investigate the joint influences of the luminance of the background and the inner contour on hue- and brightness filling-in for a stimulus configuration generating a water-color effect (WCE), i.e., a wiggly bi-chromatic contour enclosing a region with the lower luminance component on the exterior. Two stimuli with the background and inner contour luminances covarying independently were successively presented, and in separate experiments, the observer judged which member of the pair's interior regions contained a stronger hue or was brighter. Braided-contour control stimuli that generated little or no perceptual filling-in were also used to assess whether observers were judging the interior regions and not the contours themselves. Three nested models of the contributions of the background and inner contour to the judgments were fit to the data by maximum likelihood and evaluated by likelihood ratio tests. Both stimulus components contributed to both the hue and brightness of the interior region with increasing luminance of the inner contour generating an assimilative filling-in for the hue judgments but a contrast effect for the brightness judgments. Control analyses showed negligible effects for the order of the luminance of the background or inner contour on the judgments. An additive contribution of both components was rejected in favor of a saturated model in which the responses depended on the levels of both stimulus components. For the hue judgments, increased background luminance led to greater hue filling-in at higher luminances of the interior contour. For the brightness judgments, the higher background luminance generated a lower brightness contrast at higher luminances of the interior contour. The results indicate different effects of the inner contour and background on the induction of the brightness and coloration percepts of the WCE, suggesting that they are mediated by different mechanisms.</description>

	<description>Chronic pain is a common and often disabling condition, and is thought to involve a combination of peripheral and central neurobiological factors. However, the extent and nature of changes in the brain is poorly understood. Here, we investigated brain network architecture using resting state fMRI data collected from chronic back pain patients in UK and Japan (41 patients, 56 controls). Using a machine learning approach (support vector machine), we found that brain network patterns reliably classified chronic pain patients in a third, independent open data set with an accuracy of 63%, whilst 68% was attained in cross validation of all data. We then developed a deep learning classifier using a conditional variational autoencoder, which also yield yielded 63% generalisation and 68% cross-validation accuracy. Given the existence of reliable network changes, we next studied the graph topology of the network, and found consistent evidence of hub disruption based on clustering and betweenness centrality of brain nodes in pain patients. To examine this in more detail, we developed a multislice modularity algorithm to identify a consensus pattern of modular reorganisation of brain nodes across the entire data set. This revealed evidence of significant changes in the modular identity of several brain regions, most notably including broad regions of bilateral sensorimotor cortex, subregions of which also contributed to classifier performance. These results provide evidence of consistent and characteristic brain network changes in chronic pain, and highlight extensive reorganisaton of the network architecture of sensorimotor cortex.</description>

	<description>Phenomena of synchronization, rhythmogenesis and coherence found in brain networks are believed to be a dynamical substrate for cognitive functions such as learning and memory. However, it is still debated whether the rhythmic activity emerges from network morphology developed in neurogenesis or as a result of neuronal dynamics realized under certain conditions. In this research we found, that in neural networks formed in mature hippocampal cultures with high cellular density the spiking activity self-organized and converged to long, complex and rhythmically repeated superbursts. The superburst lasted tens of seconds and consisted of hundreds of short (50-100 ms) small bursts with a high spiking rate of 139.0 p.m. 78.6 Hz that can be associated with high-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus. In turn, the interval between peak burst activities in the range of 100-150 ms can be treated as a theta rhythm (11.2 p.m. 1.5 Hz). Distribution of spikes within the bursts was non-random, representing a set of well-defined space-time base patterns or motifs. We found that the long superburst can be classified into two types. Each type was associated with a unique direction of spike propagation and, hence, can be encoded by a binary sequence with random switching between the two functional states. Such precisely structured bidirectional rhythmic activity developed in self-organizing cultured networks were quite similar to what observed in the in vivo experiments.</description>

A standard view in neuroeconomics is that to make a choice, an agent first assigns subjective values to available options, and then compares them to select the best. In choice tasks, these cardinal values are typically inferred from the preference expressed by subjects between options presented in pairs. Alternatively, cardinal values can be directly elicited by asking subjects to place a cursor on an analog scale (rating task) or to exert a force on a power grip (effort task). These tasks can vary in many respects: they can notably be more or less costly and consequential. Here, we compared the value functions elicited by choice, rating and effort tasks on options composed of two monetary amounts: one for the subject (gain) and one for a charity (donation). Bayesian model selection showed that despite important differences between the three tasks, they all elicited a same value function, with similar weighting of gain and donation, but variable concavity. Moreover, value functions elicited by the different tasks could predict choices with equivalent accuracy. Our finding therefore suggests that comparable value functions can account for various motivated behaviors, beyond economic choice. Nevertheless, we report slight differences in the computational efficiency of parameter estimation that may guide the design of future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iy3NDzd9fuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Timings of human activities are marked by circadian clocks which in turn are entrained to different environmental signals. In an urban environment the presence of artificial lighting and various social cues tend to disrupt the natural entrainment with the sunlight. However, it is not completely understood to what extent this is the case. Here we exploit the large-scale data analysis techniques to study the mobile phone calling activity of people in large cities to infer the dynamics of urban daily rhythms. From the calling patterns of about 1,000,000 users spread over different cities but lying inside the same time-zone, we show that the onset and termination of the calling activity synchronizes with the east-west progression of the sun. We also find that the onset and termination of the calling activity of users follows a yearly dynamics, varying across seasons, and that its timings are entrained to solar midnight. Furthermore, we show that the average mid-sleep time of people living in urban areas depends on the age and gender of each cohort as a result of biological and social factors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nTki-D4ps3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Schools of fish and flocks of birds can move together in synchrony and decide on new directions of movement in a seamless way. This is possible because group members constantly share directional information with their neighbors. Although detecting the directionality of other group members is known to be important to maintain cohesion, it is not clear how many neighbors each individual can simultaneously track and pay attention to, and what the spatial distribution of these influential neighbors is. Here, we address these questions on shoals of &lt;i&gt;Hemigrammus rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt;, a species of fish exhibiting strong schooling behavior. We adopt a data-driven analysis technique based on the study of short-term directional correlations to identify which neighbors have the strongest influence over the participation of an individual in a collective U-turn event. We find that fish mainly react to one or two neighbors at a time. Moreover, we find no correlation between the distance rank of a neighbor and its likelihood to be influential. We interpret our results in terms of fish allocating sequential and selective attention to their neighbors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3M1-zYlXyOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Organisms have evolved adaptive mechanisms in response to stress for cellular survival. During acute hypoxic stress, cells down-regulate energy-consuming enzymes such as Na,K-ATPase. Within minutes of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) exposure to hypoxia, protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ) phosphorylates the α1-Na,K-ATPase subunit and triggers it for endocytosis, independently of the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/XBkUlSz6sBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins (ACPAs) are present in two-thirds of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ACPAs are produced in the absence of identified T cell responses for each citrullinated protein. Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), which binds proteins and citrullinates them, is the target of autoantibodies in early RA. This...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/lm04vNsjcQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Human regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress other T cells by converting the latent, inactive form of TGF-β1 into active TGF-β1. In Tregs, TGF-β1 activation requires GARP, a transmembrane protein that binds and presents latent TGF-β1 on the surface of Tregs stimulated through their T cell receptor. However, GARP is not...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/OJb1rgNy31s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Mammalian spermatogenesis is an elaborately organized differentiation process, starting with diploid spermatogonia, which include germ-line stem cells, and ending with haploid spermatozoa. The process involves four pivotal transitions occurring in physical proximity: spermatogonial differentiation, meiotic initiation, initiation of spermatid elongation, and release of spermatozoa. We report how the four transitions...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/bD6WRBgxwQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A ranking algorithm named RADIAL that predicts the molecular diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype of a patient has been developed to guide genetic testing and to align genetic findings with the clinical context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25084-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An algorithm that follows clinical practice, including patient history, clinical, magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography, and biomarker features, was developed following a review of the literature on 67 autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias and personal clinical experience. Frequency and specificity of each feature were defined for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, and corresponding prediction scores were assigned. Clinical and paraclinical features of patients are entered into the algorithm, and a patient's total score for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia is calculated, producing a ranking of possible diagnoses. Sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were assessed by blinded analysis of a multinational cohort of 834 patients with molecularly confirmed autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. The performance of the algorithm was assessed versus a blinded panel of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25084-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correct diagnosis was ranked within the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses at a sensitivity and specificity of &amp;gt;90% for 84% and 91% of the evaluated genes, respectively. Mean sensitivity and specificity of the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses were 92% and 95%, respectively. The algorithm outperformed the panel of ataxia experts (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25084-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our algorithm is highly sensitive and specific, accurately predicting the underlying molecular diagnoses of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, thereby guiding targeted sequencing or facilitating interpretation of next-generation sequencing data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Machine Interaction (BMI) system motivates interesting and promising
results in forward/feedback control consistent with human intention. It holds
great promise for advancements in patient care and applications to
neurorehabilitation. Here, we propose a novel neurofeedback-based BCI robotic
platform using a personalized social robot in order to assist patients having
cognitive deficits through bilateral rehabilitation and mental training. For
initial testing of the platform, electroencephalography (EEG) brainwaves of a
human user were collected in real time during tasks of imaginary movements.
First, the brainwaves associated with imagined body kinematics parameters were
decoded to control a cursor on a computer screen in training protocol. Then,
the experienced subject was able to interact with a social robot via our
real-time BMI robotic platform. Corresponding to subject's imagery performance,
he/she received specific gesture movements and eye color changes as
neural-based feedback from the robot. This hands-free neurofeedback interaction
not only can be used for mind control of a social robot's movements, but also
sets the stage for application to enhancing and recovering mental abilities
such as attention via training in humans by providing real-time neurofeedback
from a social robot.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A core aspect of human intelligence is the ability to learn new tasks quickly
and switch between them flexibly. Here, we describe a modular continual
reinforcement learning paradigm inspired by these abilities. We first introduce
a visual interaction environment that allows many types of tasks to be unified
in a single framework. We then describe a reward map prediction scheme that
learns new tasks robustly in the very large state and action spaces required by
such an environment. We investigate how properties of module architecture
influence efficiency of task learning, showing that a module motif
incorporating specific design principles (e.g. early bottlenecks, low-order
polynomial nonlinearities, and symmetry) significantly outperforms more
standard neural network motifs, needing fewer training examples and fewer
neurons to achieve high levels of performance. Finally, we present a
meta-controller architecture for task switching based on a dynamic neural
voting scheme, which allows new modules to use information learned from
previously-seen tasks to substantially improve their own learning efficiency.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a fusion approach that combines features from simultaneously
recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
signals to improve classification performances in motor imagery-based
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We applied our approach to a group of 15
healthy subjects and found a significant classification performance enhancement
as compared to standard single-modality approaches in the alpha and beta bands.
Taken together, our findings demonstrate the advantage of considering
multimodal approaches as complementary tools for improving the impact of
non-invasive BCIs.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07205</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel data-driven approach to discover and decode features in
the neural code coming from large population neural recordings with minimal
assumptions, using cohomological learning. We apply our approach to neural
recordings of mice moving freely in a box, where we find a circular feature. We
then observe that the decoded value corresponds well to the head direction of
the mouse. Thus we capture head direction cells and decode the head direction
from the neural population activity without having to process the behaviour of
the mouse. Interestingly, the decoded values convey more information about the
neural activity than the tracked head direction does, with differences that
have some spatial organization. Finally, we note that the residual population
activity, after the head direction has been accounted for, retains some
low-dimensional structure but with no discernible shape.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flow is a hyper-engaged state of consciousness most commonly described in
athletics, popularly termed being in the zone. Quantitative research into flow
has been hampered by the disruptive nature of gathering subjective reports.
Here we show that a passive probe (suppression of Auditory Evoked Potential in
EEG) that allowed our participants to remain engaged in a first-person shooting
game while we continually tracked the depth of their immersion corresponded
with the participants' subjective experiences, and with their objective
performance levels. Comparing this time-varying record of flow against the
overall EEG record, we identified neural correlates of flow in the anterior
cingulate cortex and the temporal pole. These areas displayed increased beta
band activity, mutual connectivity, and feedback connectivity with primary
motor cortex. These results corroborate the notion that the flow state is an
objective and quantifiable state of consciousness, which we identify and
characterize across subjective, behavioral and neural measures.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of the mediodorsal and anterior thalamus enhances correlation between thalamic BOLD activity and alpha EEG rhythm. (arXiv:1702.04195v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04195</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04195</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) with simultaneous EEG allows
volitional modulation of BOLD activity of target brain regions and
investigation of related electrophysiological activity. We applied this
approach to study correlations between thalamic BOLD activity and alpha EEG
rhythm. Healthy volunteers in the experimental group (EG, n=15) learned to
upregulate BOLD activity of the target region consisting of the mediodorsal
(MD) and anterior (AN) thalamic nuclei using the rtfMRI-nf during retrieval of
happy autobiographical memories. Healthy subjects in the control group (CG,
n=14) were provided with a sham feedback. The EG participants were able to
significantly increase BOLD activities of the MD and AN. Functional
connectivity between the MD and the inferior precuneus was significantly
enhanced during the rtfMRI-nf task. Average individual changes in the occipital
alpha EEG power significantly correlated with the average MD BOLD activity
levels for the EG. Temporal correlations between the occipital alpha EEG power
and BOLD activities of the MD and AN were significantly enhanced, during the
rtfMRI-nf task, for the EG compared to the CG. Temporal correlations with the
alpha power were also significantly enhanced for the posterior nodes of the
default mode network, including the precuneus/posterior cingulate, and for the
dorsal striatum. Our findings suggest that the temporal correlation between the
MD BOLD activity and posterior alpha EEG power is modulated by the interaction
between the MD and the inferior precuneus, reflected in their functional
connectivity. Our results demonstrate the potential of the rtfMRI-nf with
simultaneous EEG for non-invasive neuromodulation studies of human brain
function.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A model of multifractality as observed in the neuronal activity of the human basal ganglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223164v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223164v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neuronal signals are usually characterized in terms of their discharge rate. However, this level of description is inadequate to account for the complex temporal organization of spike trains. In particular, fractal and multifractal patterns can be described using methods based on the so-called structure functions. Here, increasing order temporal structure functions are applied to neuronal signals obtained from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) of patients with Parkinson disease. It is shown that these spike trains exhibit a characteristic multifractal spectrum, which is interpreted as a hallmark of the neuronal activity of the human, parkinsonian basal ganglia. Further, a neural field model is proposed to study the observed multifractality. The model consists of a partial differential equation that relates temporal to spatial activity considering a gradient field and a diffusive term. As the model is perturbed with stochastic initial conditions, the following is observed: 1. multifractality depends on the diffusive term; 2. multifractality is present for a range of diffusion coefficients; and 3. multifractal temporal properties are mirrored in space, which can be explained from the physical properties of the electric field governing neuronal activity. These results predict that passive electric properties of neuronal activity are far more relevant to the human brain than what has been usually considered.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/223156v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Surface color appearance depends on both local surface chromaticity and global context. Understanding these inter-dependencies provides insight into the network properties of the visual system. Combining functional imaging and psychophysics, we ask whether color from long-range filling-in and from a matched region of uniform chromaticity engage common pathways. We find that color from filling-in is best classified and best correlated with appearance by two dorsal areas, V3A and V3B/KO. In contrast, a uniform chromaticity is best classified by ventral areas hV4 and LO. Dynamic causal modeling revealed feedback modulation from area LO to areas V1 and V3A for uniform color surfaces, contrasting with feedback from V3A modulating areas V1 and LO for filling-in. These results indicate a dorsal stream role in color filling-in via feedback modulation of area V1 coupled with a cross-stream modulation of ventral areas suggesting that local and distant influences on color appearance engage distinct neural networks.</description>

	<description>Resting state (RS) connectivity has been increasingly studied in healthy and diseased brains in humans and animals. This paper presents a new method to analyze RS data from fMRI that combines multiple seed correlation analysis with graph-theory (MSRA). We characterize and evaluate this new method in relation to two other graph-theoretical methods and ICA. The graph-theoretical methods calculate cross-correlations of regional average time-courses, one using seed regions of the same size (SRCC) and the other using whole brain structure regions (RCCA). We evaluated the reproducibility, power, and capacity of these methods to characterize short term RS modulation to unilateral physiological whisker stimulation in rats. Graph-theoretical networks found with the MSRA approach were highly reproducible, and their communities showed large overlaps with ICA components. Additionally, MSRA was the only one of all tested methods that had the power to detect significant RS modulations induced by whisker stimulation that are controlled by family-wise error rate (FWE). Compared to the reduced resting state network connectivity during task performance, these modulations implied decreased connectivity strength in the bilateral sensorimotor and entorhinal cortex. Additionally, the contralateral ventromedial thalamus (part of the barrel field related lemniscal pathway) and the hypothalamus showed reduced connectivity. Enhanced connectivity was observed in the amygdala, especially the contralateral basolateral amygdala (involved in emotional learning processes). In conclusion, MSRA is a powerful analytical approach that can reliably detect tiny modulations of RS connectivity. It shows a great promise as a method for studying RS dynamics in healthy and pathological conditions.</description>

	<description>Configural face processing is considered to be vital for face perception. If configural face processing requires an evaluation of spatial information, might this process involve interactions between ventral stream face-processing regions and dorsal stream visuospatial-processing regions? We explored this possibility using thetaburst stimulation (TBS) with fMRI in humans. Participants were shown two faces that differed in either the shape (featural differences) or the spatial configuration (configural differences) of their features. TBS applied on dorsal location processing regions: 1) reduced fMRI activity within ventral stream face-processing regions during configural but not featural face processing; and 2) reduced functional connectivity between these face regions significantly more for configural than featural face processing. No changes occurred when TBS was delivered on the vertex control site for either face task. We conclude that ventral stream face-processing regions receive visuospatial information from dorsal stream location-processing regions during configural face processing.</description>

	<description>Learning complex vocal behaviors, like speech and birdsong, is thought to rely on continued performance evaluation. Whether candidate performance evaluation circuits in the brain are sufficient to guide vocal learning is not known. Here, we test the sufficiency of VTA projections to the vocal basal ganglia (Area X) in singing zebra finches, a songbird species that learns to produce a complex and stereotyped multi-syllabic courtship song during development. We optogenetically manipulate VTA axon terminals in singing birds contingent on how the pitch of individual song syllables are naturally performed. We find that optical excitation and inhibition of VTA terminals have opponent effects on future performances of targeted song syllables and are each sufficient to reliably guide learned changes in song, consistent with positive and negative reinforcement of performance outcomes. These findings define a central role for reinforcement mechanisms in learning vocalizations and provide the first demonstration of minimal circuit elements for learning vocal behaviors.</description>

	<description>Tonic pain after injury characterises a behavioural state that prioritises recovery. Although generally suppressing cognition and attention, tonic pain needs to allow effective relief learning so that the cause of the pain can be reduced if possible. Here, we describe a central learning circuit that supports learning of relief and concurrently suppresses the level of ongoing pain. We used computational modelling of behavioural, physiological and neuroimaging data in two experiments in which subjects learned to terminate tonic pain in static and dynamic escape-learning paradigms. In both studies, we show that relief-seeking involves a reinforcement learning process manifest by error signals in the dorsal putamen. Critically, this system also uses an uncertainty signal detected in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex that both controls the relief learning rate, and endogenously and parametrically modulates tonic pain. The results define a self-organising learning circuit that allows reduction of ongoing pain when learning about potential relief.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Active sampling state dynamically enhances olfactory bulb odor representation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/222588v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The olfactory bulb (OB) is the very first site of odor information processing, yet a wealth of contextual and learned information has been described in its activity. To investigate the mechanistic basis of contextual modulation, we use whole-cell recordings to measure odor responses across rapid (&amp;lt;30 min) learning episodes in identified mitral/tufted cells (MTCs). Across these learning episodes, we found that diverse response changes occur already during the first sniff cycle. Motivated mice develop active sniffing strategies across learning, and it is this change of active sampling state that dynamically modulates odor responses, resulting in enhanced discriminability and detectability of odor representation with learning. Evoking fast sniffing in different behavioral states demonstrates that response changes during active sampling exceed those predicted from purely feed-forward input. Finally, response changes are highly correlated in tufted cells, but not mitral cells, indicating cell-type specificity in the effect of active sampling, and resulting in increased odor detectability in the tufted and enhanced discriminability in the mitral cell population over the rapid learning episodes. Altogether, we show that active sampling state is a crucial component in modulating and enhancing olfactory bulb responsiveness on rapid timescales.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensation, mechanoreceptor and nerve fiber function after nerve regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25102</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Sensation is essential for recovery after peripheral nerve injury. However, the relationship between sensory modalities and function of regenerated fibers is uncertain. We have investigated the relationships between touch threshold, tactile gnosis and mechanoreceptor and sensory fiber function after nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Twenty-one median or ulnar nerve lesions were repaired by a collagen nerve conduit or direct suture. Quantitative sensory hand function and sensory conduction studies by near-nerve technique including tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors were followed for 2 years, and results were compared to non-injured hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At both repair methods, touch thresholds at the finger tips recovered to 81±3% and tactile gnosis only to 20±4% (P&amp;lt;0.001) of control. The sensory action potentials (SNAPs) remained dispersed and areas recovered to 23±2% and the amplitudes only to 7±1% (P&amp;lt;0.001). The areas of SNAPs after tactile stimulation recovered to 61±11% and remained slowed. Touch sensation correlated with SNAP areas (P&amp;lt;0.005) and was negatively related to the prolongation of tactile latencies (P&amp;lt;0.01); tactile gnosis was not related to electrophysiological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: The recovered function of regenerated peripheral nerve fibers and reinnervated mechanoreceptors may differentially influence recovery of sensory modalities. Touch was affected by the number and function of regenerated fibers and mechanoreceptors. In contrast, tactile gnosis depends on the input and plasticity of the CNS, which may explain the absence of a direct relation between electrophysiological parameters and poor recovery. Dispersed maturation of sensory nerve fibers with desynchronized inputs to the CNS also contributes to the poor recovery of tactile gnosis. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A hierarchical stochastic model for bistable perception</title>

Viewing of ambiguous stimuli can lead to bistable perception alternating between the possible percepts. During continuous presentation of ambiguous stimuli, percept changes occur as single events, whereas during intermittent presentation of ambiguous stimuli, percept changes occur at more or less regular intervals either as single events or bursts. Response patterns can be highly variable and have been reported to show systematic differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Existing models of bistable perception often use detailed assumptions and large parameter sets which make parameter estimation challenging. Here we propose a parsimonious stochastic model that provides a link between empirical data analysis of the observed response patterns and detailed models of underlying neuronal processes. Firstly, we use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the times between percept changes, which assumes one single state in continuous presentation and a stable and an unstable state in intermittent presentation. The HMM captures the observed differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, but remains descriptive. Therefore, we secondly propose a hierarchical Brownian model (HBM), which produces similar response patterns but also provides a relation to potential underlying mechanisms. The main idea is that neuronal activity is described as an activity difference between two competing neuronal populations reflected in Brownian motions with drift. This differential activity generates switching between the two conflicting percepts and between stable and unstable states with similar mechanisms on different neuronal levels. With only a small number of parameters, the HBM can be fitted closely to a high variety of response patterns and captures group differences between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. At the same time, it provides a link to mechanistic models of bistable perception, linking the group differences to potential underlying mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P8ypBhWLVZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Over the last ten years, isogenic tagging (IT) has revolutionised the study of bacterial infection dynamics in laboratory animal models. However, quantitative analysis of IT data has been hindered by the piecemeal development of relevant statistical models. The most promising approach relies on stochastic Markovian models of bacterial population dynamics within and among organs. Here we present an efficient numerical method to fit such stochastic dynamic models to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental IT data. A common approach to statistical inference with stochastic dynamic models relies on producing large numbers of simulations, but this remains a slow and inefficient method for all but simple problems, especially when tracking bacteria in multiple locations simultaneously. Instead, we derive and solve the systems of ordinary differential equations for the two lower-order moments of the stochastic variables (mean, variance and covariance). For any given model structure, and assuming linear dynamic rates, we demonstrate how the model parameters can be efficiently and accurately estimated by divergence minimisation. We then apply our method to an experimental dataset and compare the estimates and goodness-of-fit to those obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. While both sets of parameter estimates had overlapping confidence regions, the new method produced lower values for the division and death rates of bacteria: these improved the goodness-of-fit at the second time point at the expense of that of the first time point. This flexible framework can easily be applied to a range of experimental systems. Its computational efficiency paves the way for model comparison and optimal experimental design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9g47EDAHoGE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Public health related decisions often have to balance the cost of intervention strategies with the benefit of the reduction in disease burden. While the cost can often be inferred, forward modelling of the effect of different intervention options is complicated and disease specific. Here we introduce a package that is aimed to simplify this process. The package allows one to infer parameters using a Bayesian approach, perform forward modelling of the likely results of the proposed intervention and finally perform cost effectiveness analysis of the results. The package is based on a method previously used in the UK to inform vaccination strategies for influenza, with extensions to make it easily adaptable to other diseases and data sources.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ATHxyaSCsRU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The detailed knowledge of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; connectome for 3 decades has not contributed dramatically to our understanding of worm’s behavior. One of main reasons for this situation has been the lack of data on the type of synaptic signaling between particular neurons in the worm’s connectome. The aim of this study was to determine synaptic polarities for each connection in a small pre-motor circuit controlling locomotion. Even in this compact network of just 7 neurons the space of all possible patterns of connection types (excitation vs. inhibition) is huge. To deal effectively with this combinatorial problem we devised a novel and relatively fast technique based on genetic algorithms and large-scale parallel computations, which we combined with detailed neurophysiological modeling of interneuron dynamics and compared the theory to the available behavioral data. As a result of these massive computations, we found that the optimal connectivity pattern that matches the best locomotory data is the one in which all interneuron connections are inhibitory, even those terminating on motor neurons. This finding is consistent with recent experimental data on cholinergic signaling in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, and it suggests that the system controlling locomotion is designed to save metabolic energy. Moreover, this result provides a solid basis for a more realistic modeling of neural control in these worms, and our novel powerful computational technique can in principle be applied (possibly with some modifications) to other small-scale functional circuits in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K7E4bEqn2P8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

When we perform a cognitive task, multiple brain regions are engaged. Understanding how these regions interact is a fundamental step to uncover the neural bases of behavior. Most research on the interactions between brain regions has focused on the univariate responses in the regions. However, fine grained patterns of response encode important information, as shown by multivariate pattern analysis. In the present article, we introduce and apply multivariate pattern dependence (MVPD): a technique to study the statistical dependence between brain regions in humans in terms of the multivariate relations between their patterns of responses. MVPD characterizes the responses in each brain region as trajectories in region-specific multidimensional spaces, and models the multivariate relationship between these trajectories. We applied MVPD to the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and to the fusiform face area (FFA), using a searchlight approach to reveal interactions between these seed regions and the rest of the brain. Across two different experiments, MVPD identified significant statistical dependence not detected by standard functional connectivity. Additionally, MVPD outperformed univariate connectivity in its ability to explain independent variance in the responses of individual voxels. In the end, MVPD uncovered different connectivity profiles associated with different representational subspaces of FFA: the first principal component of FFA shows differential connectivity with occipital and parietal regions implicated in the processing of low-level properties of faces, while the second and third components show differential connectivity with anterior temporal regions implicated in the processing of invariant representations of face identity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JsgnsmP0h3k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In contrast, neurology lacks validated measurements of the physiological status, or dysfunction(s) of cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Accordingly, patients with chronic neurological diseases are often treated with a single disease-modifying therapy without understanding patient-specific drivers of disability. Therefore, using multiple sclerosis (MS) as an example of a complex polygenic neurological disease, we sought to determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are intraindividually stable, cell type-, disease- and/or process-specific, and responsive to therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

An independent validation cohort (n = 85) assessed the reliability of derived classifiers. The biological interpretation resulted from in vitro modeling of primary or stem cell–derived human CNS cells and cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

No classifiers could differentiate primary progressive from secondary progressive MS better than random guessing. Treatment-induced changes in biomarkers greatly exceeded intraindividual and technical variabilities of the assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Frequency locking and travelling bursts sequences in modular network of inhibitory neurons with differing time-scales. (arXiv:1711.06435v1 [nlin.CD])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We report the emergent dynamics of a community structured modular network of
chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with inhibitory synapses. We find the inhibitory
coupling between the neuronal modules leads to complete synchronization of
neurons in a module, and also pushes modules into interesting sequence of
travelling burst patterns. When differing dynamical time-scales are introduced
for neurons in each module, hence breaking the symmetry between them, we see
specific sequences of travelling burst patterns that are characteristic of the
time-scale mismatch and coupling strengths. For a modular network with only two
time-scales, the neuronal sub-ensembles enter into synchronized frequency
locked clusters with the bursting sequences having recurring patterns. Our
results have significance in the process of information coding in terms of
frequency of firing dynamics among neurons and in selective communication based
on the sequences of bursts.

This rescue occurs with a transition in tau aggregation from oligomeric to fibrillar forms of tau. These findings suggest a key role for RNA binding proteins in the pathophysiology of tau.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/MfulZMZVa8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Emerging Neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder</title>

	<description>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a leading cause of global disability. Its biological basis is unknown, and its treatment unsatisfactory. Here, we review two recent areas of progress. First, the discovery of risk genes and their implications, with a focus on voltage-gated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target. Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes.</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: October 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 46&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Scott W   Linderman, Samuel J   Gershman&lt;br /&gt; Computational neuroscience is, to first order, dominated by two approaches: the ‘bottom-up’ approach, which searches for statistical patterns in large-scale neural recordings, and the ‘top-down’ approach, which begins with a theory of computation and considers plausible neural implementations. While this division is not clear-cut, we argue that these approaches should be much more intimately linked. From a Bayesian perspective, computational theories provide constrained prior distributions on neural data—albeit highly sophisticated ones. By connecting theory to observation via a probabilistic model, we provide the link necessary to test, evaluate, and revise our theories in a data-driven and statistically rigorous fashion. This review highlights examples of this theory-driven pipeline for neural data analysis in recent literature and illustrates it with a worked example based on the temporal difference learning model of dopamine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Mary A   Logan&lt;br /&gt; Glial cells are essential for proper formation and maintenance of the nervous system. During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Alicia   Hidalgo, Ann   Logan&lt;br /&gt; The regenerative response of ensheating glia to central nervous system (CNS) injury involves proliferation and differentiation, axonal re-enwrapment and some recovery of behaviour. Understanding this limited response could enable the enhancement of it. In Drosophila, the glial progenitor state is maintained by Notch, an activator of cell division and Prospero (Pros), a repressor. Injury provokes the activation of NFκB and up-regulation of Kon-tiki (Kon), driving cell proliferation. Homeostatic switch-off comes about as two negative feedback loops involving Pros terminate the response. Importantly, the functions of the kon and pros homologues NG2 and prox1, respectively, are conserved in mammalian NG2 glia. Controlling these genes is key for therapeutic manipulation of progenitors and stem cells to promote regeneration of the damaged CNS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Mümine   Şentürk, Hugo J   Bellen&lt;br /&gt;  Drosophila melanogaster is a genetic model organism that has contributed to the discovery of numerous genes whose human homologues are associated with diseases. The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Natural History of Infantile-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25101</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, typically resulting in death prior to age 2. Clinical trials in this population require an understanding of disease progression and identification of meaningful biomarkers to hasten therapeutic development and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A longitudinal, multi-center, prospective natural history study enrolled 26 SMA infants, and 27 control infants less than six months of age. Recruitment occurred at 14 centers over 21 months within the NINDS-sponsored NeuroNEXT Network. Infant motor function scales (TIMPSI, CHOP-INTEND and AIMS) and putative physiologic and molecular biomarkers were assessed prior to 6 months of age and at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24-months with progression, correlations between motor function and biomarkers and hazard ratios were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Motor function scores (MFS) and CMAP decreased rapidly in SMA infants, whereas MFS in all healthy infants rapidly increased. Correlations were identified between TIMPSI and CMAP in SMA infants. TIMPSI at first study visit was associated with risk of combined endpoint of death or permanent invasive ventilation in SMA infants. Post hoc analysis of survival to combined endpoint in SMA infants with 2 copies of &lt;em&gt;SMN2&lt;/em&gt; indicated a median age of 8 months at death (95%CI: 6,17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: These data of SMA and control outcome measures delineates meaningful change in clinical trials in infantile-onset SMA. The power and utility of NeuroNEXT to provide “real world”, prospective natural history data sets to accelerate public and private drug development programs for rare disease is demonstrated.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction associates with nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss. Cholinergic neuronal loss co-occurs, particularly within a brainstem structure, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). We isolated single cholinergic neurons from post-mortem PPNs of aged controls and PD patients. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mtDNA deletions were increased significantly in PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, compared to controls the PD patients had significantly more PPN cholinergic neurons containing mtDNA deletion levels exceeding 60%, a level associated with deleterious effects on oxidative phosphorylation. The current results differ from studies reporting mtDNA depletion in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Trade-off and flexibility in the dynamic regulation of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase repertoire</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005869</guid>

Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) catalyze the ubiquitylation of substrates many of which are degraded by the 26S proteasome. Their modular architecture enables recognition of numerous substrates via exchangeable substrate receptors that competitively bind to a cullin scaffold with high affinity. Due to the plasticity of these interactions there is ongoing uncertainty how cells maintain a flexible CRL repertoire in view of changing substrate loads. Based on a series of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, different groups proposed that the exchange of substrate receptors is mediated by a protein exchange factor named Cand1. Here, we have performed mathematical modeling to provide a quantitative underpinning of this hypothesis. First we show that the exchange activity of Cand1 necessarily leads to a trade-off between high ligase activity and fast receptor exchange. Supported by measurements we argue that this trade-off yields an optimal Cand1 concentration in cells where the time scale for substrate degradation becomes minimal. In a second step we show through simulations that (i) substrates bias the CRL repertoire leading to preferential assembly of ligases for which substrates are available and (ii) differences in binding affinities or substrate receptor abundances create a temporal hierarchy for the degradation of substrates. Finally, we compare the Cand1-mediated exchange cycle with an alternative architecture lacking Cand1 which indicates superiority of a system with exchange factor if substrate receptors bind substrates and the cullin scaffold in a random order. Together, our results provide general constraints for the operating regimes of molecular exchange systems and suggest that Cand1 endows the CRL network with the properties of an “on demand” system allowing cells to dynamically adjust their CRL repertoire to fluctuating substrate abundances.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEw-9pFCpBw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern time series gene expression and other omics data sets have enabled unprecedented resolution of the dynamics of cellular processes such as cell cycle and response to pharmaceutical compounds. In anticipation of the proliferation of time series data sets in the near future, we use the Hopfield model, a recurrent neural network based on spin glasses, to model the dynamics of cell cycle in HeLa (human cervical cancer) and &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells. We study some of the rich dynamical properties of these cyclic Hopfield systems, including the ability of populations of simulated cells to recreate experimental expression data and the effects of noise on the dynamics. Next, we use a genetic algorithm to identify sets of genes which, when selectively inhibited by local external fields representing gene silencing compounds such as kinase inhibitors, disrupt the encoded cell cycle. We find, for example, that inhibiting the set of four kinases &lt;i&gt;AURKB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NEK1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TTK&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;WEE1&lt;/i&gt; causes simulated HeLa cells to accumulate in the M phase. Finally, we suggest possible improvements and extensions to our model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dik1D-o7ObU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of Allee effect in modelling post resection recurrence of glioblastoma</title>

Resection of the bulk of a tumour often cannot eliminate all cancer cells, due to their infiltration into the surrounding healthy tissue. This may lead to recurrence of the tumour at a later time. We use a reaction-diffusion equation based model of tumour growth to investigate how the invasion front is delayed by resection, and how this depends on the density and behaviour of the remaining cancer cells. We show that the delay time is highly sensitive to qualitative details of the proliferation dynamics of the cancer cell population. The typically assumed logistic type proliferation leads to unrealistic results, predicting immediate recurrence. We find that in glioblastoma cell cultures the cell proliferation rate is an increasing function of the density at small cell densities. Our analysis suggests that cooperative behaviour of cancer cells, analogous to the Allee effect in ecology, can play a critical role in determining the time until tumour recurrence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q0we1iWZQm4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The use of ambient humidity conditions to improve influenza forecast</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005844</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Shaman, Sasikiran Kandula, Wan Yang, Alicia Karspeck&lt;/p&gt;

Laboratory and epidemiological evidence indicate that ambient humidity modulates the survival and transmission of influenza. Here we explore whether the inclusion of humidity forcing in mathematical models describing influenza transmission improves the accuracy of forecasts generated with those models. We generate retrospective forecasts for 95 cities over 10 seasons in the United States and assess both forecast accuracy and error. Overall, we find that humidity forcing improves forecast performance (at 1–4 lead weeks, 3.8% more peak week and 4.4% more peak intensity forecasts are accurate than with no forcing) and that forecasts generated using daily climatological humidity forcing generally outperform forecasts that utilize daily observed humidity forcing (4.4% and 2.6% respectively). These findings hold for predictions of outbreak peak intensity, peak timing, and incidence over 2- and 4-week horizons. The results indicate that use of climatological humidity forcing is warranted for current operational influenza forecast.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i0JXQofTLZQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating the probabilities of rare arrhythmic events in multiscale computational models of cardiac cells and tissue</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005783</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark A. Walker, Viatcheslav Gurev, John J. Rice, Joseph L. Greenstein, Raimond L. Winslow&lt;/p&gt;

Ectopic heartbeats can trigger reentrant arrhythmias, leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Such events have been attributed to perturbed Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; handling in cardiac myocytes leading to spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). However, the ways in which perturbation of specific molecular mechanisms alters the probability of ectopic beats is not understood. We present a multiscale model of cardiac tissue incorporating a biophysically detailed three-dimensional model of the ventricular myocyte. This model reproduces realistic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves and DADs driven by stochastic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channel (RyR) gating and is used to study mechanisms of DAD variability. In agreement with previous experimental and modeling studies, key factors influencing the distribution of DAD amplitude and timing include cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations, inwardly rectifying potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;) density, and gap junction conductance. The cardiac tissue model is used to investigate how random RyR gating gives rise to probabilistic triggered activity in a one-dimensional myocyte tissue model. A novel spatial-average filtering method for estimating the probability of extreme (i.e. rare, high-amplitude) stochastic events from a limited set of spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release profiles is presented. These events occur when randomly organized clusters of cells exhibit synchronized, high amplitude Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release flux. It is shown how reduced I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt; density and gap junction coupling, as observed in heart failure, increase the probability of extreme DADs by multiple orders of magnitude. This method enables prediction of arrhythmia likelihood and its modulation by alterations of other cellular mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HW_jVhxIPps&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pitch and timbre discrimination at wave-to-spike transition in the cochlea. (arXiv:1711.05596v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05596</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05596</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A new definition of musical pitch is proposed. A Finite-Difference Time
Domain (FDTM) model of the cochlea is used to calculate spike trains caused by
tone complexes and by a recorded classical guitar tone. All harmonic tone
complexes, musical notes, show a narrow-band Interspike Interval (ISI) pattern
at the respective fundamental frequency of the tone complex. Still this
fundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the
respective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark
bands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the
basically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These
drop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time
spans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the
fundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary
to pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over
bark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with residue
pitches. The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause
undertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case
overtones can appear. This might explain the musical minor scale, which was
proposed to be caused by undertones already in 1880 by Hugo Riemann, still
until now without knowledge about any physical realization of such undertones.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Altered structural connectivity of the left visual thalamus in developmental dyslexia. (arXiv:1711.05517v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05517</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental dyslexia is characterized by persistent reading and spelling
deficits. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical
sensory structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by-and-large focuses
on the cerebral cortex. These studies found that dyslexia is typically
associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed
left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network. However, findings from animal models
and post-mortem studies in humans suggest that developmental dyslexia might
also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways.
Whether these alterations also exist in developmental dyslexia in-vivo and how
they relate to dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here we used ultra-high
resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and
probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the
visual sensory pathway in dyslexia in-vivo. We discovered that individuals with
developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connections in the direct
pathway between the left visual thalamus (LGN) and left middle temporal area
V5/MT, but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex (V1). In
addition, left V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming
abilities - a key deficit in dyslexia [14]. These findings provide the first
evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the
sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental dyslexia. The results challenge
current standard models and provide novel evidence for the importance of
cortico-thalamic interactions in explaining dyslexia.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Statistical crossover and nonextensive behavior of the neuronal short-term depression. (arXiv:1701.03164v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03164</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03164</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theoretical basis of neuronal coding, associated with short term
degradation in synaptic transmission, is a matter of debate in the literature.
In fact, electrophysiological signals are commonly characterized as inversely
proportional to stimulus intensity. Among theoretical descriptions of this
phenomenon, models based on $1/f$-dependency are employed to investigate the
biophysical properties of the short term synaptic depression. In this work we
formulated a model based on a paradigmatic \textit{q}-differential equation to
obtain a generalized formalism useful for investigation of nonextensivity in
this specific type of synaptic plasticity. Our analysis reveals nonextensivity
in data from electrophysiological recordings and also a statistical crossover
in neurotransmission. In particular, statistical transitions providesadditional
support to the hypothesis of heterogeneous release probability of
neurotransmitters. On the other hand, the simple vesicle model agrees with data
only at low frequency stimulations. Thus, the present work presents a method to
demonstrate that short-term depression is not only governed by random
mechanisms but also by a nonextensive behavior. Our findings also conciliate
morphological and electrophysiological investigations into a coherent
biophysical scenario.

	<description>How Wnt signaling coordinates vascular remodeling and barrier maturation in the retina is poorly understood. Mazzoni et al. demonstrate that mice lacking Apcdd1 exhibit decreased vessel pruning and precocious formation of the blood-retina barrier. Conversely, Apcdd1 overexpression in endothelial cells induces the opposite phenotype. Apcdd1 precisely sculpts Wnt activity to coordinate vascular pruning and barrier maturation.</description>

Compositional data consist of vectors of proportions normalized to a constant sum from a basis of unobserved counts. The sum constraint makes inference on correlations between unconstrained features challenging due to the information loss from normalization. However, such correlations are of long-standing interest in fields including ecology. We propose a novel Bayesian framework (BAnOCC: Bayesian Analysis of Compositional Covariance) to estimate a sparse precision matrix through a LASSO prior. The resulting posterior, generated by MCMC sampling, allows uncertainty quantification of any function of the precision matrix, including the correlation matrix. We also use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the transformation from the unobserved counts to the composition in order to investigate what characteristics of the unobserved counts can make the correlations more or less difficult to infer. On simulated datasets, we show that BAnOCC infers the true network as well as previous methods while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Larger and more realistic simulated datasets further showed that BAnOCC performs well as measured by type I and type II error rates. Finally, we apply BAnOCC to a microbial ecology dataset from the Human Microbiome Project, which in addition to reproducing established ecological results revealed unique, competition-based roles for Proteobacteria in multiple distinct habitats.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3ybTOXu3yrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A coupled-oscillator model of olfactory bulb gamma oscillations</title>

The olfactory bulb transforms not only the information content of the primary sensory representation, but also its underlying coding metric. High-variance, slow-timescale primary odor representations are transformed by bulbar circuitry into secondary representations based on principal neuron spike patterns that are tightly regulated in time. This emergent fast timescale for signaling is reflected in gamma-band local field potentials, presumably serving to efficiently integrate olfactory sensory information into the temporally regulated information networks of the central nervous system. To understand this transformation and its integration with interareal coordination mechanisms requires that we understand its fundamental dynamical principles. Using a biophysically explicit, multiscale model of olfactory bulb circuitry, we here demonstrate that an inhibition-coupled intrinsic oscillator framework, pyramidal resonance interneuron network gamma (PRING), best captures the diversity of physiological properties exhibited by the olfactory bulb. Most importantly, these properties include global zero-phase synchronization in the gamma band, the phase-restriction of informative spikes in principal neurons with respect to this common clock, and the robustness of this synchronous oscillatory regime to multiple challenging conditions observed in the biological system. These conditions include substantial heterogeneities in afferent activation levels and excitatory synaptic weights, high levels of uncorrelated background activity among principal neurons, and spike frequencies in both principal neurons and interneurons that are irregular in time and much lower than the gamma frequency. This coupled cellular oscillator architecture permits stable and replicable ensemble responses to diverse sensory stimuli under various external conditions as well as to changes in network parameters arising from learning-dependent synaptic plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AGOv1I-gt9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A memory mechanism based on two dimensional code of neurosome pattern. (arXiv:1711.05042v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05042</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have recognized that 2D codes, i.e., a group of strongly connected
neurosomes that can be simultaneously excited, are the basic data carriers for
memory in a brain. An echoing mechanism between two neighboring layers of
neurosomes is assumed to establish temporary memory, and repeating processes
enhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory
information are statistically. The maximum capacity of memory storage in a
human brain is estimated to be one billion of 2D codes. By triggering one or
more neurosomes in a neurosome-based 2D code, the whole strongly connected
neurosome network is capable of exciting simultaneously and projecting its
excitation onto an analysis layer of neurons in cortex, thus retrieving the
stored memory data. The capability of comparing two 2D codes in the analysis
layer is one of the major brain functions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modelling stochastic resonance in humans: the influence of lapse rate. (arXiv:1711.04950v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04950</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04950</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adding noise to a sensory signal generally decreases human performance.
However noise can improve performance too, due to a process called stochastic
resonance (SR). This paradoxical effect may be exploited in psychophysical
experiments, to provide additional insights into how the sensory system deals
with noise. Here, I develop a model for stochastic resonance to study the
influence of noise on human perception, in which the biological parameter of
`lapse rate' was included. I show that the inclusion of lapse rate allows for
the occurrence of stochastic resonance in terms of the performance metric d'.
At the same time, I show that high levels of lapse rate cause stochastic
resonance to disappear. It is also shown that noise generated in the brain
(i.e., internal noise) may obscure any effect of stochastic resonance in
experimental settings. I further relate the model to a standard equivalent
noise model, the linear amplifier model, and show that the lapse rate can
function to scale the threshold versus noise (TvN) curve, similar to the
efficiency parameter in equivalent noise (EN) models. Therefore, lapse rate
provides a psychophysical explanation for reduced efficiency in EN paradigms.
Furthermore, I note that ignoring lapse rate may lead to an overestimation of
internal noise in equivalent noise paradigms. Overall, describing stochastic
resonance in terms of signal detection theory, with the inclusion of lapse
rate, may provide valuable new insights into how human performance depends on
internal and external noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A model of electrical impedance tomography on peripheral nerves for a neural-prosthetic control interface. (arXiv:1711.04377v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04377</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04377</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: A model is presented to evaluate the viability of using electrical
impedance tomography (EIT) with a nerve cuff to record neural activity in
peripheral nerves. Approach: Established modelling approaches in neural-EIT are
expanded on to be used, for the first time, on myelinated fibres which are
abundant in mammalian peripheral nerves and transmit motor commands. Main
results: Fibre impedance models indicate activity in unmyelinated fibres can be
screened out using operating frequencies above 100 Hz. At 1 kHz and 10 mm
electrode spacing, impedance magnitude of inactive intra-fascicle tissue and
the fraction changes during neural activity are estimated to be 1,142
{\Omega}.cm and -8.8x10-4, respectively, with a transverse current, and 328
{\Omega}.cm &amp;amp; -0.30, respectively with a longitudinal current. We show that a
novel EIT drive and measurement electrode pattern which utilises longitudinal
current and longitudinal differential boundary voltage measurements could
distinguish activity in different fascicles of a three-fascicle mammalian nerve
using pseudo-experimental data synthesised to replicate real operating
conditions. Significance: The results of this study provide an estimate of the
transient change in impedance of intra-fascicle tissue during neural activity
in mammalian nerve, and present a viable EIT electrode pattern, both of which
are critical steps towards implementing EIT in a nerve cuff for neural
prosthetics interfaces.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A free-boundary model of a motile cell explains turning behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005862</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/F3soywyLL-A/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Masoud Nickaeen, Igor L. Novak, Stephanie Pulford, Aaron Rumack, Jamie Brandon, Boris M. Slepchenko, Alex Mogilner&lt;/p&gt;

To understand shapes and movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, we systematically explore minimal free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility consisting of the force-balance and myosin transport equations. The models account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which in turn reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of the protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, which represent myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When the contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. Scanning of a model parameter space shows that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F3soywyLL-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Proteoglycans (PGs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) play vital roles in axon growth and navigation, plasticity, and regeneration of injured neurons. Different classes of PGs may support or inhibit cell growth, and their functions are determined in part by highly specific structural features. Among these, the pattern of sulfation on the PG sugar chains is a paramount determinant of a diverse and flexible set of outcomes. Recent studies of PG sulfation illustrate the challenges of attributing biological actions to specific sulfation patterns, and suggest ways in which highly similar molecules may exert opposing effects on neurons.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model-based clustering method to detect infectious disease transmission outbreaks from sequence variation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005868</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Rosemary M. McCloskey, Art F. Y. Poon&lt;/p&gt;

Clustering infections by genetic similarity is a popular technique for identifying potential outbreaks of infectious disease, in part because sequences are now routinely collected for clinical management of many infections. A diverse number of nonparametric clustering methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods are generally intuitive, rapid to compute, and readily scale with large data sets. However, we have found that nonparametric clustering methods can be biased towards identifying clusters of diagnosis—where individuals are sampled sooner post-infection—rather than the clusters of rapid transmission that are meant to be potential foci for public health efforts. We develop a fundamentally new approach to genetic clustering based on fitting a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which represents the evolution of transmission rates along the tree relating different infections. We evaluated this model-based method alongside five nonparametric clustering methods using both simulated and actual HIV sequence data sets. For simulated clusters of rapid transmission, the MMPP clustering method obtained higher mean sensitivity (85%) and specificity (91%) than the nonparametric methods. When we applied these clustering methods to published sequences from a study of HIV-1 genetic clusters in Seattle, USA, we found that the MMPP method categorized about half (46%) as many individuals to clusters compared to the other methods. Furthermore, the mean internal branch lengths that approximate transmission rates were significantly shorter in clusters extracted using MMPP, but not by other methods. We determined that the computing time for the MMPP method scaled linearly with the size of trees, requiring about 30 seconds for a tree of 1,000 tips and about 20 minutes for 50,000 tips on a single computer. This new approach to genetic clustering has significant implications for the application of pathogen sequence analysis to public health, where it is critical to robustly and accurately identify clusters for the most cost-effective deployment of outbreak management and prevention resources.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DCiNkk7egBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A craniofacial-specific monosynaptic circuit enables heightened affective pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A craniofacial-specific monosynaptic circuit enables heightened affective pain, Published online: 13 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0012-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0012-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The authors show that unlike body sensory neurons, craniofacial nociceptive neurons directly synapse with noxious-stimulus-activated lateral parabrachial neurons (PBL), which in turn project to multiple limbic centers processing emotions and affects. This monosynaptic pathway is both sufficient and necessary for craniofacial-pain-activated aversive behaviors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/eh7QEfg1seA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25094</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: A reduction in glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) predicts conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tracks disease progression, signifying its importance in AD. We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG PET measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent dataset (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=870). Lastly, we assessed whether significant SNPs influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=210 &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=159).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; and reduced [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG decline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;= 4.44 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;). In a follow-up analysis using an independent dataset, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 3.41 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered &lt;em&gt;PPPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretations&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heterogenous migraine aura symptoms correlate with visual cortex fMRI responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25096</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25096</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Migraine aura is sparsely studied due to the highly challenging task of capturing patients during aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is likely the underlying phenomenon of aura. The possible correlation between the multifaceted phenomenology of aura symptoms and the effects of CSD on the brain has not been ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Five migraine patients were studied during various forms of aura symptoms induced by hypoxia, sham or physical exercise and photostimulation. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signal response to visual stimulation was measured in retinotopic mapping defined visual cortex area V1 - V4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We found reduced BOLD response in patients reporting scotoma and increased response in patients who only experienced positive symptoms. Furthermore, patients with bilateral visual symptoms had corresponding bi-hemispherical changes in BOLD response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These findings suggest that different aura symptoms reflect different types of cerebral dysfunction, which correspond to specific changes in BOLD signal reactivity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of bilateral CSD recorded by fMRI during bilateral aura symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A localized pallidal physiomarker in cervical dystonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25095</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25095</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for direct recordings of neuronal activity from the human basal ganglia. In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia such a physiomarker is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. This way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlates with clinical improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Dystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta, but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (ρ=0.4; P=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (ρ=0.5; P=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (ρ=0.23; P=0.002), which coincided with three previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (ρ=0.38; P=0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Our findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutations in ABCD1 cause the neurodegenerative disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, which manifests as the spinal cord axonopathy adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in nearly all males surviving into adulthood. Microglial dysfunction has long been implicated in pathogenesis of brain disease, but its role in the spinal cord is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed spinal cord microglia in humans and mice with AMN and investigated the role of ABCD1 in microglial activity toward neuronal phagocytosis in cell culture. Because mutations in ABCD1 lead to incorporation of very-long-chain fatty acids into phospholipids, we separately examined the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) upon microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the spinal cord of humans and mice with AMN, upregulation of several phagocytosis-related markers, such as MFGE8 and TREM2, precedes complement activation and synapse loss. Unexpectedly, this occurs in the absence of overt inflammation. LPC C26:0 added to ABCD1-deficient microglia in culture further enhances MFGE8 expression, aggravates phagocytosis, and leads to neuronal injury. Furthermore, exposure to a MFGE8-blocking antibody reduces phagocytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord microglia lacking ABCD1 are primed for phagocytosis, affecting neurons within an altered metabolic milieu. Blocking phagocytosis or specific phagocytic receptors may alleviate synapse loss and axonal degeneration. Ann Neurol 2017;82:813–827&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region for gait recovery after stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25086</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-third of all stroke survivors are unable to walk, even after intensive physiotherapy. Thus, other concepts to restore walking are needed. Because electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is known to elicit gait movements, this area might be a promising target for restorative neurostimulation in stroke patients with gait disability. The present study aims to delineate the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the MLR (MLR-HFS) on gait impairment in a rodent stroke model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male Wistar rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode into the right MLR. Gait was assessed using clinical scoring of the beam-walking test and video-kinematic analysis (CatWalk) at baseline and on days 3 and 4 after experimental stroke with and without MLR-HFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinematic analysis revealed significant changes in several dynamic and static gait parameters resulting in overall reduced gait velocity. All rats exhibited major coordination deficits during the beam-walking challenge and were unable to cross the beam. Simultaneous to the onset of MLR-HFS, a significantly higher walking speed and improvements in several dynamic gait parameters were detected by the CatWalk system. Rats regained the ability to cross the beam unassisted, showing a reduced number of paw slips and misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLR-HFS can improve disordered locomotor function in a rodent stroke model. It may act by shielding brainstem and spinal locomotor centers from abnormal cortical input after stroke, thus allowing for compensatory and independent action of these circuits.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stereoelectroencephalography and surgical outcome in polymicrogyria-related epilepsy: A multicentric study</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to (1) assess the concordance between various polymicrogyria (PMG) types and the associated epileptogenic zone (EZ), as defined by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), and (2) determine the postsurgical seizure outcome in PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range, 2–50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia, or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74%, and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but 1 PMG patient with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean, 4.6 years; range, 1–16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, given that the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. Ann Neurol 2017;82:781–794&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A clinical predictive score for postoperative myasthenic crisis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mostly caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor associated with thymus abnormalities. Thymectomy has been proven to be an efficacious treatment for patients with MG, but postoperative myasthenic crisis often occurs and is a major complication. We aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system based on clinical characteristics in the preoperative status to predict the risk of postoperative myasthenic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 393 patients with MG who underwent thymectomy at 6 tertiary centers in Japan (275 patients for derivation and 118 for validation). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset and operation, body mass index, disease duration, MG subtype, severity, symptoms, preoperative therapy, operative data, and laboratory data, were reviewed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression with LASSO penalties was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative myasthenic crisis, and a score was assigned. Finally, the predictive score was evaluated using bootstrapping technique in the derivation and validation groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multivariate logistic regression identified 3 clinical factors for predicting postoperative myasthenic crisis risk: (1) vital capacity &amp;lt; 80%, (2) disease duration &amp;lt; 3 months, and (3) bulbar symptoms immediately before thymectomy. The postoperative myasthenic crisis predictive score, ranging from 0 to 6 points, had areas under the curve of 0.84 (0.66–0.96) in the derivation group and 0.80 (0.62–0.95) in the validation group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: A Systematic Look at Environmental Modulation and Its Impact in Brain Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30210-2?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30210-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Several experimental procedures are currently used to investigate the impact of the environment on brain plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. The available methodologies are aimed at obtaining global or specific reductions or intensifications of the stimuli, with initial standardization in animal models being paralleled by translational applications to humans. More procedures can be combined together or applied in series to obtain powerful experimental paradigms, and the choice of a given setting should take into account the specific genetic background, age, and phenotypic vulnerabilities of the target subjects.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Rebalancing the Addicted Brain: Oxytocin Interference with the Neural Substrates of Addiction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30200-X?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30200-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Drugs that act on the brain oxytocin (OXT) system may provide a much-needed treatment breakthrough for substance-use disorders. Targeting the brain OXT system has the potential to treat addiction to all major classes of addictive substance and to intervene across all stages of the addiction cycle. Emerging evidence suggests that OXT is able to interfere with such a wide range of addictive behaviours for such a wide range of addictive substances by rebalancing core neural systems that become dysregulated over the course of addiction.</description>

                        Arid1b haploinsufficiency causes autism and intellectual disability, yet the neurobiological basis of this is unknown. The authors demonstrate that Arid1b-heterozygous mice have impaired cortical interneuron development and epigenetic signatures. These mice also have cognitive and social deficits, which are reversed by treatment with a GABA&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;-receptor-positive allosteric modulator.&lt;/p&gt;, isJats=true)&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/aXWe6_DqvAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using optical imaging, electrophysiology, and local pharmacological infusions, Winder et al. found that resting hemodynamic signals were weakly correlated with neural activity and that these hemodynamic fluctuations persisted when neural activity was silenced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/SopjUiopxeg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The brain has the ability to sense, coordinate, and respond to environmental changes through biological processes involving activity-dependent gene expression. cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs) have recently emerged as novel transcriptional regulators of essential biological functions, while their deregulation is linked to age-related human diseases. In the brain, CRTCs are unique signaling factors that act as sensors and integrators of hormonal, metabolic, and neural signals contributing to brain plasticity and brain–body communication.</description>

Similar neural mechanisms might be used to form ‘maps’ of nonphysical spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/OAUPMVGkuwg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
