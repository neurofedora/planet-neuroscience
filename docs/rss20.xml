Spatially explicit livestock disease models require demographic data for individual farms or premises. In the U.S., demographic data are only available aggregated at county or coarser scales, so disease models must rely on assumptions about how individual premises are distributed within counties. Here, we addressed the importance of realistic assumptions for this purpose. We compared modeling of foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks using simple randomization of locations to premises configurations predicted by the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS), which infers location based on features such as topography, land-cover, climate, and roads. We focused on three premises-level Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed models available from the literature, all using the same kernel approach but with different parameterizations and functional forms. By computing the basic reproductive number of the infection (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) for both FLAPS and randomized configurations, we investigated how spatial locations and clustering of premises affects outbreak predictions. Further, we performed stochastic simulations to evaluate if identified differences were consistent for later stages of an outbreak. Using Ripley’s &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; to quantify clustering, we found that FLAPS configurations were substantially more clustered at the scales relevant for the implemented models, leading to a higher frequency of nearby premises compared to randomized configurations. As a result, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was typically higher in FLAPS configurations, and the simulation study corroborated the pattern for later stages of outbreaks. Further, both &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and simulations exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity in terms of differences between configurations. Thus, using realistic assumptions when de-aggregating locations based on available data can have a pronounced effect on epidemiological predictions, affecting if, where, and to what extent FMD may invade the population. We conclude that methods such as FLAPS should be preferred over randomization approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VWjvSF_hLYk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that proteins are locally synthesized in healthy, mature central nervous system axons and presynaptic terminals &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Presynaptic, mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins are locally synthesized in most adult axons of diverse cell types, linking local translation to axon function and survival. Accordingly, inhibiting the intra-axonal translation of key mRNAs or the function of their translational regulators causes dying-back axon degeneration, and human mutations in RNA metabolic pathways are increasingly being associated with neurodegenerative diseases that accompany axon degeneration. Here, we summarize recent relevant findings in a highly simplified ‘RNA operon’-based model and discuss open questions and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Optogenetic Control of Spine-Head JNK Reveals a Role in Dendritic Spine Regression</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we use an optogenetic inhibitor of c-Jun NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-terminal kinase (JNK) in dendritic spine sub-compartments of rat hippocampal neurons. We show that JNK inhibition exerts rapid (within seconds) reorganization of actin in the spine-head. Using real-time Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure JNK activity, we find that either excitotoxic insult (NMDA) or endocrine stress (corticosterone), activate spine-head JNK causing internalization of AMPARs and spine retraction. Both events are prevented upon optogenetic inhibition of JNK, and rescued by JNK inhibition even 2 h after insult. Moreover, we identify that the fast-acting anti-depressant ketamine reduces JNK activity in hippocampal neurons suggesting that JNK inhibition may be a downstream mediator of its anti-depressant effect. In conclusion, we show that JNK activation plays a role in triggering spine elimination by NMDA or corticosterone stress, whereas inhibition of JNK facilitates regrowth of spines even in the continued presence of glucocorticoid. This identifies that JNK acts locally in the spine-head to promote AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage following stress, and reveals a protective function for JNK inhibition in preventing spine regression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Poor concordance of floxed sequence recombination in single neural stem cells: Implications for cell autonomous studies</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;To manipulate target gene function in specific adult cell populations, tamoxifen-dependent CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; is widely used to drive inducible, site-specific recombination of loxP flanked sequences. In studies of cell autonomous target gene function, it is common practice to combine these CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;-lox systems with a ubiquitously expressed stop-floxed fluorescent reporter gene to identify single cells supposedly undergoing target gene recombination. Here, we studied the reliability of using Cre-induced recombination of one gene to predict recombination in another gene at the single cell level in adult hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using both probabilistic predictions in a generic experimental paradigm, as well as a mouse model with two separate stop-floxed reporters plus a Nestin promoter-driven CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;, we found that, in individual cells, recombination of one gene was a poor predictor of recombination in another. This poor concordance in floxed sequence recombination across genes suggests that use of stop-floxed reporters to investigate cell autonomous gene function may not be universally reliable and could lead to false conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the reliability of a widely used transgenic mouse model in studies of adult NSPCs. Ligand-dependent Cre recombinases, such as the CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; model, are a fundamental tool for inducible gene modification used to investigate gene function in many cell populations. It is common practice to combine NSPC-specific CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;-lox systems with a ubiquitously expressed stop-floxed fluorescent reporter gene to identify single cells undergoing target gene recombination in studies of cell autonomous gene function. Our probabilistic predictions and experimental data suggest that use of stop-floxed reporters to investigate cell autonomous gene function in NSPCs may lead to false conclusions because recombination in separate genes can show poor concordance in individual cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Learning of Movement Intent and Reaction Time for EEG-informed Adaptation of Rehabilitation Robots. (arXiv:2002.08354v1 [cs.RO])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08354</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08354</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence suggests that adaptation is a crucial mechanism for
rehabilitation robots in promoting motor learning. Yet, it is commonly based on
robot-derived movement kinematics, which is a rather subjective measurement of
performance, especially in the presence of a sensorimotor impairment. Here, we
propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses
electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective measurement of two kinematics
components that are typically used to assess motor learning and thereby
adaptation: i) the intent to initiate a goal-directed movement, and ii) the
reaction time (RT) of that movement. We evaluated our CNN on data acquired from
an in-house experiment where 13 subjects moved a rehabilitation robotic arm in
four directions on a plane, in response to visual stimuli. Our CNN achieved
average test accuracies of 80.08% and 79.82% in a binary classification of the
intent (intent vs. no intent) and RT (slow vs. fast), respectively. Our results
demonstrate how individual movement components implicated in distinct types of
motor learning can be predicted from synchronized EEG data acquired before the
start of the movement. Our approach can, therefore, inform robotic adaptation
in real-time and has the potential to further improve one's ability to perform
the rehabilitation task.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Geometrical Optical Illusion via Sub-Riemannian Geodesics in the Roto-Translation Group. (arXiv:2002.08063v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08063</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a neuro-mathematical model for geometrical optical illusions
(GOIs), a class of illusory phenomena that consists in a mismatch of
geometrical properties of the visual stimulus and its associated percept. They
take place in the visual areas V1/V2 whose functional architecture have been
modelled in previous works by Citti and Sarti as a Lie group equipped with a
sub-Riemannian (SR) metric. Here we extend their model proposing that the
metric responsible for the cortical connectivity is modulated by the modelled
neuro-physiological response of simple cells to the visual stimulus, hence
providing a more biologically plausible model that takes into account a
presence of visual stimulus. Illusory contours in our model are described as
geodesics in the new metric. The model is confirmed by numerical simulations,
where we compute the geodesics via SR-Fast Marching.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they
are typically limited by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own
complexity (the &quot;black box problem&quot;). In this paper, we train a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI)
connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply
this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically
developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterise with
inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings, we additionally
perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing
to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble
model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774,
0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and task vs rest, respectively.
Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two
visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional
connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification.
Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also
able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre dataset,
finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing
different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed),
and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep
learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal
and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate
nucleus and paracentral sulcus.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Unbalancing the Attentional Priority Map via Gaze-Contingent Displays Induces Neglect-Like Visual Exploration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Selective spatial attention is a crucial cognitive process that guides us to the behaviorally relevant objects in a complex visual world by using exploratory eye movements. The spatial location of objects, their (bottom-up) saliency and (top-down) relevance is assumed to be encoded in one “attentional priority map” in the brain, using different egocentric (eye-, head- and trunk-centered) spatial reference frames. In patients with hemispatial neglect, this map is supposed to be imbalanced, leading to a spatially biased exploration of the visual environment. As a proof of concept, we altered the visual saliency (and thereby attentional priority) of objects in a naturalistic scene along a left-right spatial gradient and investigated whether this can induce a bias in the exploratory eye movements of healthy humans (n = 28; all right-handed; mean age: 23 years, range 19–48). We developed a computerized mask, using high-end “gaze-contingent display (GCD)” technology, that immediately and continuously reduced the saliency of objects on the left—“left” with respect to the head (body-centered) and the current position on the retina (eye-centered). In both experimental conditions, task-free viewing and goal-driven visual search, this modification induced a mild but significant bias in visual exploration similar to hemispatial neglect. Accordingly, global eye movement parameters changed (reduced number and increased duration of fixations) and the spatial distribution of fixations indicated an attentional bias towards the right (rightward shift of first orienting, fixations favoring the scene’s outmost right over left). Our results support the concept of an attentional priority map in the brain as an interface between perception and behavior and as one pathophysiological ground of hemispatial neglect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;MRI gradient-fields may induce extrinsic voltage between electrodes and conductive neurostimulator enclosure of implanted deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems, and may cause unintended stimulation and/or malfunction. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations using detailed anatomical human models, therapy implant trajectories, and gradient coil models can be used to calculate clinically relevant induced voltage levels. Incorporating additional anatomical human models into the EM simulation library can help to achieve more clinically relevant and accurate induced voltage levels, however, adding new anatomical human models and developing implant trajectories is time-consuming, expensive and not always feasible.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MRI gradient-field induced voltage levels are simulated in six adult human anatomical models, along clinically relevant DBS implant trajectories to generate the dataset. Predictive artificial neural network (ANN) regression models are trained on the simulated dataset. Leave-one-out cross validation is performed to assess the performance of ANN regressors and quantify model prediction errors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;More than 180,000 unique gradient-induced voltage levels are simulated. ANN algorithm with two fully connected layers is selected due to its superior generalizability compared to support vector machine and tree-based algorithms in this particular application. The ANN regression model is capable of producing thousands of gradient-induced voltage predictions in less than a second with mean-squared-error less than 200 mV.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We have integrated machine learning (ML) with computational modeling and simulations and developed an accurate predictive model to determine MRI gradient-field induced voltage levels on implanted DBS systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mechanotransduction Activity Facilitates Hair Cell Toxicity Caused by the Heavy Metal Cadmium</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hair cells are sensitive to many insults including environmental toxins such as heavy metals. We show here that cadmium can consistently kill hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line. Disrupting hair cell mechanotransduction genetically or pharmacologically significantly reduces the amount of hair cell death seen in response to cadmium, suggesting a role for mechanotransduction in this cell death process, possibly as a means for cadmium uptake into the cells. Likewise, when looking at multiple cilia-associated gene mutants that have previously been shown to be resistant to aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, resistance to cadmium-induced hair cell death is only seen in those with mechanotransduction defects. In contrast to what was seen with mechanotransduction, significant protection was not consistently seen from other ions previously shown to compete for cadmium uptake into cells or tissue including zinc and copper. These results show that functional mechanotransduction activity is playing a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Filling the Gaps – A Call for Comprehensive Analysis of Extracellular Matrix of the Glial Scar in Region- and Injury-Specific Contexts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00032</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) injury results in chronic scar formation that interferes with function and inhibits repair. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is prominent in the scar and potently regulates cell behavior. However, comprehensive information about the ECM proteome is largely lacking, and region- as well as injury-specific differences are often not taken into account. These aspects are the focus of our perspective on injury and scar formation. To highlight the importance of such comprehensive proteome analysis we include data obtained with novel analysis tools of the ECM composition in the scar and show the contribution of monocytes to the ECM composition after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Monocyte invasion was reduced using the CCR2-/- mouse line and step-wise de-cellularization and proteomics allowed determining monocyte-dependent ECM composition and architecture of the glial scar. We find significant reduction in the ECM proteins Tgm1, Itih (1,2, and 3), and Ftl in the absence of monocyte invasion. We also describe the scar ECM comprising zones with distinctive composition and show a subacute signature upon comparison to proteome obtained at earlier times after TBI. These results are discussed in light of injury-, region- and time-specific regulation of scar formation highlighting the urgent need to differentiate injury conditions and CNS-regions using comprehensive ECM analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost. Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Longitudinal Characterization and Biomarkers of Age and Sex Differences in the Decline of Spatial Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current longitudinal study examined factors (sex, physical function, response to novelty, ability to adapt to a shift in light/dark cycle, brain connectivity), which might predict the emergence of impaired memory during aging. Male and female Fisher 344 rats were tested at 6, 12, and 18 months of age. Impaired spatial memory developed in middle-age (12 months), particularly in males, and the propensity for impairment increased with advanced age. A reduced response to novelty was observed over the course of aging, which is inconsistent with cross-sectional studies. This divergence likely resulted from differences in the history of environmental enrichment/impoverishment for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Animals that exhibited lower level exploration of the inner region on the open field test exhibited better memory at 12 months. Furthermore, males that exhibited a longer latency to enter a novel environment at 6 months, exhibited better memory at 12 months. For females, memory at 12 months was correlated with the ability to behaviorally adapt to a shift in light/dark cycle. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, conducted at 12 months, indicated that the decline in memory was associated with altered functional connectivity within different memory systems, most notably between the hippocampus and multiple regions such as the retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala. Overall, some factors, specifically response to novelty at an early age and the capacity to adapt to shifts in light cycle, predicted spatial memory in middle-age, and spatial memory is associated with corresponding changes in brain connectivity. We discuss similarities and differences related to previous longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, as well as the role of sex differences in providing a theoretical framework to guide future longitudinal research on the trajectory of cognitive decline. In addition to demonstrating the power of longitudinal studies, these data highlight the importance of middle-age for identifying potential predictive indicators of sexual dimorphism in the trajectory in brain and cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Can Brief Cognitive or Medication Management Tasks Identify the Potential for Dependence in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: The identification of functional performance deficits is critical to the community independence of older adults. We examined whether a combined cognitive and performance-based medication management measure would be able to better classify an individual’s functional cognitive status and potential for instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment than either measure alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Design and Methods: Community-dwelling adults age 55 and older (n = 185) were administered the Mini-Cog, the Medication Transfer Screen-Revised (MTS-R), a combination measure the Medi-Cog-Revised (Medi-Cog-R), the Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS) Checkbook Balancing and Shopping tasks (PCST), additional cognitive screening measures, and a self-report daily living scale. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were computed for the Mini-Cog, MTS-R and the Medi-Cog-R using the PCST performance as the criterion measure. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were computed for each measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The Medi-Cog-R most accurately identified individuals as impaired on the PCST. An AUC statistic of 0.82 for the Medi-Cog-R was greater than either the Mini-Cog (0.75) or the MTS-R (0.73). The Medi-Cog-R demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.78 in classifying individuals with impaired IADL as measured by the PCST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion and Implications: The Mini-Cog, the MTS-R, and the Medi-Cog-R all show discriminant validity, but the combined measure demonstrates greater sensitivity and specificity than either component measure alone in identifying IADL impairment. The Medi-Cog-R appears to be a useful screening measure for functional cognition and can be used to prompt further assessment and intervention to promote community independence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: ParB spreading on DNA requires cytidine triphosphate in vitro</title>

	<description>In all living organisms, it is essential to transmit genetic information faithfully to the next generation. The SMC-ParAB-&lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt; system is widely employed for chromosome segregation in bacteria. A DNA-binding protein ParB nucleates on &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt; sites and must associate with neighboring DNA, a process known as spreading, to enable efficient chromosome segregation. Despite its importance, how the initial few ParB molecules nucleating at &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt; sites recruit hundreds of further ParB to spread is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute a &lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt;-dependent ParB spreading event using purified proteins from &lt;i&gt;Caulobacter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;crescentus&lt;/i&gt; and show that CTP is required for spreading. We further show that ParB spreading requires a closed DNA substrate, and a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator can act as a roadblock to attenuate spreading unidirectionally &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our biochemical reconstitutions recapitulate many observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; properties of ParB and opens up avenues to investigate the interactions between ParB-&lt;i&gt;parS&lt;/i&gt; with ParA and SMC.</description>

	<description>Feedback inhibitory motifs are thought to be important for pattern separation across species. How feedback circuits may implement pattern separation of biologically plausible, temporally structured input in mammals is, however, poorly understood. We have quantitatively determined key properties of &lt;i&gt;net&lt;/i&gt;feedback inhibition in the mouse dentate gyrus, a region critically involved in pattern separation. Feedback inhibition is recruited steeply with a low dynamic range (0% to 4% of active GCs), and with a non-uniform spatial profile. Additionally, net feedback inhibition shows frequency-dependent facilitation, driven by strongly facilitating mossy fiber inputs. Computational analyses show a significant contribution of the feedback circuit to pattern separation of theta modulated inputs, even within individual theta cycles. Moreover, pattern separation was selectively boosted at gamma frequencies, in particular for highly similar inputs. This effect was highly robust, suggesting that frequency-dependent pattern separation is a key feature of the feedback inhibitory microcircuit.</description>

	<description>The hippocampus, a region critical for memory and spatial navigation, has been implicated in delay discounting, the decline in subjective reward value when a delay is imposed. However, how delay information is encoded in the hippocampus is poorly understood. Here we recorded from CA1 of mice performing a delay-discounting decision-making task, where delay lengths, delay positions, and reward amounts were changed across sessions, and identified subpopulations of CA1 neurons which increased or decreased their firing rate during long delays. The activity of both delay-active and -suppressive cells reflected delay length, delay position, and reward amount; however manipulating reward amount differentially impacted the two populations, suggesting distinct roles in the valuation process. Further, genetic deletion of NMDA receptor in hippocampal pyramidal cells impaired delay-discount behavior and diminished delay-dependent activity in CA1. Our results suggest that distinct subclasses of hippocampal neurons concertedly support delay-discounting decisions in a manner dependent on NMDA receptor function.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Rapid regulation of vesicle priming explains synaptic facilitation despite heterogeneous vesicle:Ca2+ channel distances</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51032</link>
	<description>Chemical synaptic transmission relies on the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced fusion of transmitter-laden vesicles whose coupling distance to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels determines synaptic release probability and short-term plasticity, the facilitation or depression of repetitive responses. Here, using electron- and super-resolution microscopy at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction we quantitatively map vesicle:Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel coupling distances. These are very heterogeneous, resulting in a broad spectrum of vesicular release probabilities within synapses. Stochastic simulations of transmitter release from vesicles placed according to this distribution revealed strong constraints on short-term plasticity; particularly facilitation was difficult to achieve. We show that postulated facilitation mechanisms operating via activity-dependent changes of vesicular release probability (e.g. by a facilitation fusion sensor) generate too little facilitation and too much variance. In contrast, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent mechanisms rapidly increasing the number of releasable vesicles reliably reproduce short-term plasticity and variance of synaptic responses. We propose activity-dependent inhibition of vesicle un-priming or release site activation as novel facilitation mechanisms.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The transpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of the major cell-wall synthesis machinery in E. coli</title>

	<description>Bacterial shape is physically determined by the peptidoglycan cell wall. The cell-wall-synthesis machinery responsible for rod shape in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;is the processive 'Rod complex'. Previously, cytoplasmic MreB filaments were thought to govern formation and localization of Rod complexes based on local cell-envelope curvature. Using single-particle tracking of the transpeptidase and Rod-complex component PBP2, we found that PBP2 binds to a substrate different from MreB. Depletion and localization experiments of other putative Rod-complex components provide evidence that none of those provide the sole rate-limiting substrate for PBP2 binding. Consistently, we found only weak correlations between MreB and envelope curvature in the cylindrical part of cells. Residual correlations do not require curvature-based Rod-complex initiation but can be attributed to persistent rotational motion. We therefore speculate that the local cell-wall architecture provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation, either through direct binding by PBP2 or through an unknown intermediate.</description>

	<description>How brains encode social stimuli and transform these representations into advantageous behavioral responses is not well-understood. Here, we show that social isolation activates an oxytocinergic, nociceptive circuit in the larval zebrafish hypothalamus. We further demonstrate that chemical cues released from conspecific animals modulate its activity to regulate defensive behaviors and appetite. Our collective data reveals a model through which social stimuli can be integrated into fundamental neural circuits to mediate adaptive behaviour.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chronic stress exacerbates acute stress-induced neuronal activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and ventral hippocampus that correlates with behavioral deficits in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.19.956672v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Altered activity of corticolimbic brain regions is a hallmark of stress-related illnesses, including mood disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and substance abuse disorders. Acute stress adaptively recruits brain region-specific functions for coping, while sustained activation under chronic stress may overwhelm feedback mechanisms and lead to pathological cellular and behavioral responses. The neural mechanisms underlying dysregulated stress response and how they contribute to behavioral deficits are poorly characterized. Here, we tested whether prior exposure to chronic restraint stress (CRS) or unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) in mice could alter neuronal response to acute stress and whether these changes are associated with chronic stress-induced behavioral deficits. More specifically, we assessed neuronal activation indexed by c-Fos+ cell counts in 24 stress- and mood-related brain regions, and determined if changes in acute stress-induced neuronal activation were linked to chronic stress-induced behavioral impairments. Results indicated that CRS and UCMS led to convergent physiological and anxiety-like deficits, whereas cognition was impaired only in UCMS mice. CRS and UCMS exposure exacerbated neuronal activation in response to an acute stressor in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) area 24b and ventral hippocampal (vHPC) CA1, CA3, and subiculum. In dysregulated brain regions, levels of neuronal activation were positively correlated with principal components capturing variance across widespread behavioral alterations relevant to stress-related disorders. Our data supports an association between a dysregulated stress response, altered corticolimbic excitation/inhibition balance, and the expression of maladaptive behaviors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Sigma-2 Receptor/TMEM97, PGRMC1, and LDL Receptor complex are responsible for the cellular uptake of Aβ42 and its protein aggregates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.19.956359v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.19.956359v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Our lab has recently shown that the Sigma-2 Receptor/Transmembrane Protein 97 (TMEM97) and Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1) form a complex with the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR), and this intact complex is required for efficient uptake of lipoproteins such as LDL and apolipoprotein E (apoE). These receptors are expressed in the nervous system where they have implications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where apoE is involved in neuronal uptake and accumulation of A{beta}42, eventually cascading into neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately, dementia. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the intact Sigma-2 receptor complex - TMEM97, PGRMC1, and LDLR - is necessary for internalization of apoE and A{beta}42 monomers (mA{beta}42) and oligomers (oA{beta}42), and the disruption of the receptor complex inhibits uptake. Results: The results of this study suggest that the intact Sigma-2 receptor complex is a binding site for mA{beta}42 and oA{beta}42, in the presence or absence of apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. The loss or pharmacological inhibition of one or both of these proteins results in the disruption of the complex leading to decreased uptake of mA{beta}42 and oA{beta}42 and apoE in primary neurons. Conclusion: The TMEM97, PGRMC1, and LDLR complex is a pathway for the cellular uptake of A{beta}42 via apoE dependent and independent mechanisms. This study suggests that the complex may potentially be a novel pharmacological target to decrease neuronal A{beta}42 internalization and accumulation, which may represent a new strategy for inhibiting the rate of neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and progression of AD.</description>

	<description>Early adversity is a key risk factor for the development of adult psychopathology, including anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. Rodent models of early adversity program persistent behavioral, molecular, metabolic, and neurophysiological changes. Perturbed signaling via forebrain Gq-coupled neurotransmitter receptors is a common feature across multiple models of early adversity. We addressed whether enhanced Gq-mediated signaling in forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life can evoke long-lasting mood-related behavioral changes. Excitatory hM3Dq DREADD-mediated chemogenetic activation of CamKII-positive forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life (P2-14) increased anxiety- and despair-like behavior, and evoked sensorimotor gating deficits in adulthood. In contrast, chronic chemogenetic hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the juvenile or adult window did not evoke any mood-related behavioral alterations, highlighting the criticality of the postnatal temporal window. The enhanced anxiety-, despair- and schizophrenia-like behavioral changes evoked by chronic chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal life, was accompanied by an increased cortical and hippocampal metabolic rate of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in adulthood. Furthermore, animals with a history of postnatal hM3Dq activation exhibited a decline in the expression of activity-dependent and plasticity-associated markers within the hippocampus, along with perturbed hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory currents in adulthood. These results indicate that Gq signaling mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during the critical postnatal window is sufficient to program altered mood-related behavior, as well as metabolic and neurophysiological changes in forebrain glutamate and GABA systems, recapitulating specific aspects of the consequences of early adversity.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Connectome‐based propagation model in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25706?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral MRI data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n=208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group‐ and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, both at the group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore the potential as a prognostic biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: October 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 64&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Richard Mooney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vocalizations are an important medium for sexual and social signaling in mammals and birds. In most mammals other than humans, vocalizations are specified by innate mechanisms and develop normally in the absence of auditory experience. By contrast, juvenile songbirds memorize and copy the songs of adult tutors, a process with many parallels to human speech learning. Despite the centrality of vocal learning to human speech, vocal production in humans as well as in songbirds exploits ancestral circuitry for innate vocalizations, and effective vocal communication depends on the fluent blending of innate and learned elements. This review covers recent advances in our understanding of central mechanisms for learned and innate vocalizations in birds and mice, including brainstem mechanisms that help to ‘gate’ vocalizations on or off, cortical involvement in learned and innate vocalizations, and the delineation of circuits that evaluate and reinforce song performance to facilitate vocal learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: MANF Ablation Causes Prolonged Activation of the UPR without Neurodegeneration in the Mouse Midbrain Dopamine System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein that regulates ER homeostasis and unfolded protein response (UPR). The biology of endogenous MANF in the mammalian brain is unknown and therefore we studied the brain phenotype of MANF-deficient female and male mice at different ages focusing on the midbrain dopamine system and cortical neurons. We show that a lack of MANF from the brain led to the chronic activation of UPR by upregulation of the endoribonuclease activity of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) pathway. Furthermore, in the aged MANF-deficient mouse brain in addition the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) branches of the UPR pathways were activated. Neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with chronic ER stress. In our mouse model, increased UPR activation did not lead to neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra (SN), decrease of striatal dopamine or behavioral changes of MANF-deficient mice. However, cortical neurons lacking MANF were more vulnerable to chemical induction of additional ER stress &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We conclude that embryonic neuronal deletion of MANF does not cause the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in mice. However, endogenous MANF is needed for maintenance of neuronal ER homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The zona incerta is a subthalamic nucleus proposed to link sensory stimuli with motor responses to guide behavior, but its functional role is not well established. Using mice of either sex, we studied the effect of manipulating zona incerta GABAergic cells on the expression of a signaled locomotor action, known as signaled active avoidance. We found that modulation of GABAergic zona incerta cells, but not of cells in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT), fully controls the expression of signaled active avoidance responses. Inhibition of zona incerta GABAergic cells drives active avoidance responses, while excitation of these cells blocks signaled active avoidance mainly by inhibiting cells in the midbrain pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). The zona incerta regulates signaled locomotion in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increase in blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a crucial step in neuroinflammatory processes. We previously showed that N Methyl D Aspartate Receptor (NMDARs), expressed on cerebral endothelial cells forming the BBB, regulate immune cell infiltration across this barrier in the mouse. Here, we describe the mechanism responsible for the action of NMDARs on BBB permeabilization. We report that mouse CNS endothelial NMDARs display the regulatory GluN3A subunit. This composition confers to NMDARs' unconventional properties: these receptors do not induce Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx but rather show nonionotropic properties. In inflammatory conditions, costimulation of human brain endothelial cells by NMDA agonists (NMDA or glycine) and the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator, previously shown to potentiate NMDAR activity, induces metabotropic signaling via the Rho/ROCK pathway. This pathway leads to an increase in permeability via phosphorylation of myosin light chain and subsequent shrinkage of human brain endothelial cells. Together, these data draw a link between NMDARs and the cytoskeleton in brain endothelial cells that regulates BBB permeability in inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The authors describe how NMDARs expressed on endothelial cells regulate blood–brain barrier function via myosin light chain phosphorylation and increase in permeability. They report that these non-neuronal NMDARs display distinct structural, functional, and pharmacological features than their neuronal counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Open spina bifida (OSB) is one of the most prevalent congenital malformations of the CNS that often leads to severe disabilities. Previous studies reported the volume and thickness of the neocortex to be altered in children and adolescents diagnosed with OSB. Until now, the onset and the underlying cause of the atypical neocortex organization in OSB patients remain largely unknown. To examine the effects of OSB on fetal neocortex development, we analyzed human fetuses of both sexes diagnosed with OSB between 11 and 15 weeks of gestation by immunofluorescence for established neuronal and neural progenitor marker proteins and compared the results with healthy controls of the same, or very similar, gestational age. Our data indicate that neocortex development in OSB fetuses is altered as early as 11 weeks of gestation. We observed a marked reduction in the radial thickness of the OSB neocortex, which appears to be attributable to a massive decrease in the number of deep- and upper-layer neurons per field, and found a marked reduction in the number of basal progenitors (BPs) per field in the OSB neocortex, consistent with an impairment of cortical neurogenesis underlying the neuronal decrease in OSB fetuses. Moreover, our data suggest that the decrease in BP number in the OSB neocortex may be associated with BPs spending a lesser proportion of their cell cycle in M-phase. Together, our findings expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of OSB and support the need for an early fetal therapy (i.e., in the first trimester of pregnancy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Open spina bifida (OSB) is one of the most prevalent congenital malformations of the CNS. This study provides novel data on neocortex development of human OSB fetuses. Our data indicate that neocortex development in OSB fetuses is altered as early as 11 weeks of gestation. We observed a marked reduction in the radial thickness of the OSB neocortex, which appears to be attributable a decrease in the number of deep- and upper-layer neurons per field, and found a marked reduction in the number of basal progenitors per field, indicating that impaired neurogenesis underlies the neuronal decrease in OSB fetuses. Our findings support the need for an early fetal therapy and expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of OSB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Mitochondria Modulation of LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and neuroinflammation are two prominent pathological features increasingly realized as important pathogenic mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases. However, little attempt has been taken to investigate the likely interactions between them. Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein regulating mitochondrial fusion, a dynamic process essential for mitochondrial function. To explore the significance of neuronal mitochondria in the regulation of neuroinflammation, male and female transgenic mice with forced overexpression of Mfn2 specifically in neurons were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a widely used approach to model neurodegeneration-associated neuroinflammation. Remarkably, LPS-induced lethality was almost completely abrogated in neuronal Mfn2 overexpression mice. Compared with nontransgenic wild-type mice, mice with neuronal Mfn2 overexpression also exhibited alleviated bodyweight loss, behavioral sickness, and myocardial dysfunction. LPS-induced release of IL-1β but not TNF-α was further found greatly inhibited in the CNS of mice with neuronal Mfn2 overexpression, whereas peripheral inflammatory responses in the blood, heart, lung, and spleen remained unchanged. At the cellular and molecular levels, neuronal Mfn2 suppressed the activation of microglia, prevented LPS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons, and importantly, upregulated the expression of CX3CL1, a unique chemokine constitutively produced by neurons to suppress microglial activation. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized possible role of neuronal mitochondria in the regulation of microglial activation, and propose neuronal Mfn2 as a likely mechanistic linker between neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our study suggests that Mfn2 in neurons contributes to the regulation of neuroinflammation. Based on the remarkable suppression of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and dynamic abnormalities by neuronal Mfn2, this study centered on Mfn2-mediated neuroinflammation reveals novel molecular mechanisms that are involved in both mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. The pharmacological targeting of Mfn2 may present a novel treatment for neuroinflammation-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Medial Prefrontal Cortex Neural Plasticity, Orexin Receptor 1 Signaling, and Connectivity with the Lateral Hypothalamus Are Necessary in Cue-Potentiated Feeding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive processes contribute to the control of feeding behavior and help organism's survival when they support physiological needs. They can become maladaptive, such as when learned food cues drive feeding in the absence of hunger. Associative learning is the basis for cue-driven food seeking and consumption, and behavioral paradigms with Pavlovian cue-food conditioning are well established. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying circuit plasticity across cue-food learning, cue memory recall, and subsequent food motivation are unknown. Here, we demonstrated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a site of learning-induced plasticity and signaling of the neuropeptide orexin within the mPFC mediates cue potentiated feeding (CPF). First, using a marker of neuronal activation, &lt;i&gt;c-fos,&lt;/i&gt; we confirmed that the mPFC is activated during CPF. Next, to assess whether the same mPFC neuronal ensemble is activated during cue-food learning and later CPF, we used the Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation method in &lt;i&gt;c-fos-lacZ&lt;/i&gt; transgenic male and female rats. Selective inactivation of the mPFC neurons that were active during the last cue-food training session abolished CPF during test, demonstrating that the mPFC is a site of plasticity. We postulated that integration of food cue memory and feeding motivation requires mPFC communications with lateral hypothalamus and showed that disconnection of that system abolished CPF. Then we showed that lateral hypothalamus orexin-producing neurons project to the mPFC. Finally, we blocked orexin receptor 1 signaling in the mPFC and showed that it is a neuromodulator necessary for the cue-driven consumption. Together, our findings identify a causal function for the mPFC in the cognitive motivation to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, and the associated health consequences are serious and costly. The causes of obesity are complex because, in addition to physiological energy and nutrient needs, environmental cues can drive feeding through hedonic and cognitive processes. Learned food cues from the environment can powerfully stimulate appetite and food consumption in the absence of hunger. Using an animal model for cue-potentiated feeding, the current study determined the mPFC neuronal plasticity and neuropeptide orexin signaling are critical circuit and neurotransmitter mechanisms involved in this form of cognitive motivation to eat. These findings identify key targets for potential treatment of excessive appetite and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Activation of the Basolateral Amygdala Promotes Both Appetitive Conditioning and the Instrumental Pursuit of Reward Cues</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1732?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reward-associated stimuli can both evoke conditioned responses and acquire reinforcing properties in their own right, becoming avidly pursued. Such conditioned stimuli (CS) can guide reward-seeking behavior in adaptive (e.g., locating food) and maladaptive (e.g., binge eating) ways. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulates conditioned responses evoked by appetitive CS, but less is known about how the BLA contributes to the instrumental pursuit of CS. Here we studied the influence of BLA neuron activity on both behavioral effects. Water-restricted male rats learned to associate a light-tone cue (CS) with water delivery into a port. During these Pavlovian conditioning sessions, we paired CS presentations with photo-stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing BLA neurons. BLA photo-stimulation potentiated CS-evoked port entries during conditioning, indicating enhanced conditioned approach and appetitive conditioning. Next, new rats received Pavlovian conditioning without photo-stimulation. These rats then received instrumental conditioning sessions where they could press an inactive lever or an active lever that produced CS presentation, without water delivery. Rats pressed more on the active versus inactive lever, and pairing CS presentation with BLA-ChR2 photo-stimulation intensified responding for the CS. This suggests that BLA-ChR2 photo-stimulation enhanced CS incentive value. In a separate experiment, rats did not reliably self-administer BLA-ChR2 stimulations, suggesting that BLA neurons do not carry a primary reward signal. Last, intra-BLA infusions of d-amphetamine also intensified lever-pressing for the CS. The findings suggest that BLA-mediated activity facilitates CS control over behavior by enhancing both appetitive Pavlovian conditioning and instrumental pursuit of CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cues paired with rewards can guide animals to valuable resources such as food. Cues can also promote dysfunctional reward-seeking behavior, as in overeating. Reward-paired cues influence reward seeking through two major mechanisms. First, reward-paired cues evoke conditioned anticipatory behaviors to prepare for impending rewards. Second, reward-paired cues are powerful motivators and they can evoke pursuit in their own right. Here we show that increasing neural activity in the basolateral amygdala enhances both conditioned anticipatory behaviors and pursuit of reward-paired cues. The basolateral amygdala therefore facilitates cue-induced control over behavior by both increasing anticipation of impending rewards and making reward cues more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Invariance in SCA6 Is Related to Smaller Cerebellar Lobule VI and Greater Disease Severity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1722?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulating muscle force and timing are fundamental for accurate motor performance. In spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), there is evidence that individuals have greater force dysmetria but display better temporal accuracy during fast goal directed contractions. Here, we test whether greater temporal accuracy occurs in all individuals with SCA6, and can be explained by lesser temporal variability. Further we examine whether it is linked to disease severity and specific degenerative changes in the cerebellum. Nineteen human participants with SCA6 (13 woman) and 18 healthy controls performed fast goal-directed ankle dorsiflexion contractions aiming at a spatiotemporal target. We quantified the endpoint control of these contractions, gray matter (GM) integrity of the cerebellum, and disease severity using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). SCA6 individuals exhibited lower temporal endpoint error and variability than the healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008). Statistically, SCA6 clustered into two distinct groups for temporal variability. A group with low temporal variability ranging from 10 to 19% (SCA6a) and a group with temporal variability similar to healthy controls (SCA6b; 19–40%).SCA6a exhibited greater disease severity than SCA6b, as assessed with ICARS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Lower temporal variability, which was not associated with disease duration (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.2), did correlate with both greater ICARS (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.3) and reduced GM volume in cerebellar lobule VI (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35). Other cerebellar lobules did not relate to temporal variability. We provide new evidence that a subset of SCA6 with greater loss of GM in cerebellum lobule VI exhibit temporal invariance and more severe ataxia than other SCA6 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Variability is an inherent feature of voluntary movement, and traditionally more variability in the targeted output infers impaired performance. For example, cerebellar patients present exacerbated temporal variability during multijoint movements, which is thought to contribute to their motor deficits. In the current work, we show that in a subgroup of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 individuals, temporal variability is lower than that of healthy controls when performing single-joint fast-goal directed movements. This invariance related to exacerbated atrophy of lobule VI of the cerebellum and exacerbated disease severity. The relation between invariance and disease severity suggests that pathological motor variability can manifest not only as an exacerbation but also as a reduction relative to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Relating Visual Production and Recognition of Objects in Human Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Drawing is a powerful tool that can be used to convey rich perceptual information about objects in the world. What are the neural mechanisms that enable us to produce a recognizable drawing of an object, and how does this visual production experience influence how this object is represented in the brain? Here we evaluate the hypothesis that producing and recognizing an object recruit a shared neural representation, such that repeatedly drawing the object can enhance its perceptual discriminability in the brain. We scanned human participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 31; 11 male) using fMRI across three phases of a training study: during training, participants repeatedly drew two objects in an alternating sequence on an MR-compatible tablet; before and after training, they viewed these and two other control objects, allowing us to measure the neural representation of each object in visual cortex. We found that: (1) stimulus-evoked representations of objects in visual cortex are recruited during visually cued production of drawings of these objects, even throughout the period when the object cue is no longer present; (2) the object currently being drawn is prioritized in visual cortex during drawing production, while other repeatedly drawn objects are suppressed; and (3) patterns of connectivity between regions in occipital and parietal cortex supported enhanced decoding of the currently drawn object across the training phase, suggesting a potential neural substrate for learning how to transform perceptual representations into representational actions. Together, our study provides novel insight into the functional relationship between visual production and recognition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans can produce simple line drawings that capture rich information about their perceptual experiences. However, the mechanisms that support this behavior are not well understood. Here we investigate how regions in visual cortex participate in the recognition of an object and the production of a drawing of it. We find that these regions carry diagnostic information about an object in a similar format both during recognition and production, and that practice drawing an object enhances transmission of information about it to downstream regions. Together, our study provides novel insight into the functional relationship between visual production and recognition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Progression from Feature-Specific Brain Activity to Hippocampal Binding during Episodic Encoding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1701?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of episodic memory is recollecting multiple perceptual details tied to a specific spatial-temporal context. To remember an event, it is therefore necessary to integrate such details into a coherent representation during initial encoding. Here we tested how the brain encodes and binds multiple, distinct kinds of features in parallel, and how this process evolves over time during the event itself. We analyzed data from 27 human subjects (16 females, 11 males) who learned a series of objects uniquely associated with a color, a panoramic scene location, and an emotional sound while fMRI data were collected. By modeling how brain activity relates to memory for upcoming or just-viewed information, we were able to test how the neural signatures of individual features as well as the integrated event changed over the course of encoding. We observed a striking dissociation between early and late encoding processes: left inferior frontal and visuo-perceptual signals at the onset of an event tracked the amount of detail subsequently recalled and were dissociable based on distinct remembered features. In contrast, memory-related brain activity shifted to the left hippocampus toward the end of an event, which was particularly sensitive to binding item color and sound associations with spatial information. These results provide evidence of early, simultaneous feature-specific neural responses during episodic encoding that predict later remembering and suggest that the hippocampus integrates these features into a coherent experience at an event transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding and remembering complex experiences are crucial for many socio-cognitive abilities, including being able to navigate our environment, predict the future, and share experiences with others. Probing the neural mechanisms by which features become bound into meaningful episodes is a vital part of understanding how we view and reconstruct the rich detail of our environment. By testing memory for multimodal events, our findings show a functional dissociation between early encoding processes that engage lateral frontal and sensory regions to successfully encode event features, and later encoding processes that recruit hippocampus to bind these features together. These results highlight the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of encoding processes supporting multimodal event representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity-Dependent Calcium Signaling in Neurons of the Medial Superior Olive during Late Postnatal Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of sensory circuits is partially guided by sensory experience. In the medial superior olive (MSO), these refinements generate precise coincidence detection to localize sounds in the azimuthal plane. Glycinergic inhibitory inputs to the MSO, which tune the sensitivity to interaural time differences, undergo substantial structural and functional refinements after hearing onset. Whether excitation and calcium signaling in the MSO are similarly affected by the onset of acoustic experience is unresolved. To assess the time window and mechanism of excitatory and calcium-dependent refinements during late postnatal development, we quantified EPSCs and calcium entry in MSO neurons of Mongolian gerbils of either sex raised in a normal and in an activity altered, omnidirectional white noise environment. Global dendritic calcium transients elicited by action potentials disappeared rapidly after hearing onset. Local synaptic calcium transients decreased, leaving a GluR2 lacking AMPAR-mediated influx as the only activity-dependent source in adulthood. Exposure to omnidirectional white noise accelerated the decrease in calcium entry, leaving membrane properties unaffected. Thus, sound-driven activity accelerates the excitatory refinement and shortens the period of activity-dependent calcium signaling around hearing onset. Together with earlier reports, our findings highlight that excitation, inhibition, and biophysical properties are differentially sensitive to distinct features of sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons in the medial superior olive, an ultra-fast coincidence detector for sound source localization, acquire their specialized function through refinements during late postnatal development. The refinement of inhibitory inputs that convey sensitivity to relevant interaural time differences is instructed by the experience of sound localization cues. Which cues instruct the refinement of excitatory inputs, calcium signaling, and biophysical properties is unknown. Here we demonstrate a time window for activity- and calcium-dependent refinements limited to shortly after hearing onset. Exposure to omnidirectional white noise, which suppresses sound localization cues but increases overall activity, accelerates the refinement of calcium signaling and excitatory inputs without affecting biophysical membrane properties. Thus, the refinement of excitation, inhibition, and intrinsic properties is instructed by distinct cues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Continuous Representations of Speed by Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1679?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1679?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum is critical for controlling motor output. However, it remains unclear how striatal output neurons encode and facilitate movement. A prominent theory suggests that striatal units encode movements in bursts of activity near specific events, such as the start or end of actions. These bursts are theorized to gate or permit specific motor actions, thereby encoding and facilitating complex sequences of actions. An alternative theory has suggested that striatal neurons encode continuous changes in sensory or motor information with graded changes in firing rate. Supporting this theory, many striatal neurons exhibit such graded changes without bursting near specific actions. Here, we evaluated these two theories in the same recordings of mice (both male and female). We recorded single-unit and multiunit activity from the dorsomedial striatum of mice as they spontaneously explored an arena. We observed both types of encoding, although continuous encoding was more prevalent than bursting near movement initiation or termination. The majority of recorded units did not exhibit positive linear relationships with speed but instead exhibited nonlinear relationships that peaked at a range of locomotor speeds. Bulk calcium recordings of identified direct and indirect pathway neurons revealed similar speed tuning profiles, indicating that the heterogeneity in response profiles was not due to this genetic distinction. We conclude that continuous encoding of speed is a central component of movement encoding in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The striatum is a structure that is linked to volitional movements and is a primary site of pathology in movement disorders. It remains unclear how striatal neurons encode motor parameters and use them to facilitate movement. Here, we evaluated two models for this: a &quot;discrete encoding model&quot; in which striatal neurons facilitate movements with brief burst of activity near the start and end of movements, and a &quot;continuous encoding model,&quot; in which striatal neurons encode the sensory or motor state of the animal with continuous changes in firing. We found evidence primarily in support of the continuous encoding model. This may have implications for understanding the striatal control of movement, as well as informing therapeutic approaches for treating movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Information-Limiting Correlations in Large Neural Populations</title>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1668?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neural code requires understanding how populations of neurons code information. Theoretical models predict that information may be limited by correlated noise in large neural populations. Nevertheless, analyses based on tens of neurons have failed to find evidence of saturation. Moreover, some studies have shown that noise correlations can be very small, and therefore may not affect information coding. To determine whether information-limiting correlations exist, we implanted eight Utah arrays in prefrontal cortex (PFC; area 46) of two male macaque monkeys, recording &amp;gt;500 neurons simultaneously. We estimated information in PFC about saccades as a function of ensemble size. Noise correlations were, on average, small (~10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt;). However, information scaled strongly sublinearly with ensemble size. After shuffling trials, destroying noise correlations, information was a linear function of ensemble size. Thus, we provide evidence for the existence of information-limiting noise correlations in large populations of PFC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent theoretical work has shown that even small correlations can limit information if they are &quot;differential correlations,&quot; which are difficult to measure directly. However, they can be detected through decoding analyses on recordings from a large number of neurons over a large number of trials. We have achieved both by collecting neural activity in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex of macaques using eight microelectrode arrays (768 electrodes), from which we were able to compute accurate information estimates. We show, for the first time, strong evidence for information-limiting correlations. Despite pairwise correlations being small (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt;), they affect information coding in populations on the order of 100 s of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Roles of Mediodorsal Nucleus of the Thalamus and Prefrontal Cortex in Decision-Making and State Representation in a Cognitive Control Task Measuring Deficits in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1650?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1650?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) is reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and although the MD has been implicated in a range of PFC-dependent cognitive functions (Watanabe and Funahashi, 2012; Mitchell and Chakraborty, 2013; Parnaudeau et al., 2018), little is known about how MD neurons in the primate participate specifically in cognitive control, a capability that reflects the ability to use contextual information (such as a rule) to modify responses to environmental stimuli. To learn how the MD-PFC thalamocortical network is engaged to mediate forms of cognitive control that are selectively disrupted in schizophrenia, we trained male monkeys to perform a variant of the AX continuous performance task, which reliably measures cognitive control deficits in patients (Henderson et al., 2012) and used linear multielectrode arrays to record neural activity in the MD and PFC simultaneously. We found that the two structures made clearly different contributions to distributed processing for cognitive control: MD neurons were specialized for decision-making and response selection, whereas prefrontal neurons were specialized to preferentially encode the environmental state on which the decision was based. In addition, we observed that functional coupling between MD and PFC was strongest when the decision as to which of the two responses in the task to execute was being made. These findings delineate unique contributions of MD and PFC to distributed processing for cognitive control and characterized neural dynamics in this network associated with normative cognitive control performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive control is fundamental to healthy human executive functioning (Miller and Cohen, 2001) and deficits in patients with schizophrenia relate to decreased functional activation of the MD thalamus and the prefrontal cortex (Minzenberg et al., 2009), which are reciprocally linked (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Xiao et al., 2009). We carry out simultaneous neural recordings in the MD and PFC while monkeys perform a cognitive control task translated from patients with schizophrenia to relate thalamocortical dynamics to cognitive control performance. Our data suggest that state representation and decision-making computations for cognitive control are preferentially performed by PFC and MD, respectively. This suggests experiments to parse decision-making and state representation deficits in patients while providing novel computational targets for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap between preclinical cellular models of disease and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of human cognitive network dynamics, there is a pressing need for informative biophysical models. Here we assess dynamic causal models (DCM) of cortical network responses, as generative models of magnetoencephalographic observations during an auditory oddball roving paradigm in healthy adults. This paradigm induces robust perturbations that permeate frontotemporal networks, including an evoked 'mismatch negativity' response and transiently induced oscillations. Here, we probe GABAergic influences in the networks using double-blind placebo-controlled randomized-crossover administration of the GABA reuptake inhibitor, tiagabine (oral, 10 mg) in healthy older adults. We demonstrate the facility of conductance-based neural mass mean-field models, incorporating local synaptic connectivity, to investigate laminar-specific and GABAergic mechanisms of the auditory response. The neuronal model accurately recapitulated the observed magnetoencephalographic data. Using parametric empirical Bayes for optimal model inversion across both drug sessions, we identify the effect of tiagabine on GABAergic modulation of deep pyramidal and interneuronal cell populations. We found a transition of the main GABAergic drug effects from auditory cortex in standard trials to prefrontal cortex in deviant trials. The successful integration of pharmaco- magnetoencephalography with dynamic causal models of frontotemporal networks provides a potential platform on which to evaluate the effects of disease and pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding human brain function and developing new treatments require good models of brain function. We tested a detailed generative model of cortical microcircuits that accurately reproduced human magnetoencephalography, to quantify network dynamics and connectivity in frontotemporal cortex. This approach identified the effect of a test drug (GABA-reuptake inhibitor, tiagabine) on neuronal function (GABA-ergic dynamics), opening the way for psychopharmacological studies in health and disease with the mechanistic precision afforded by generative models of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reorganization of the Primate Dorsal Horn in Response to a Deafferentation Lesion Affecting Hand Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1625?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of sensory input following a spinal deafferentation injury can be debilitating, and this is especially true in primates when the hand is involved. Although significant recovery of function occurs, little is currently understood about the reorganization of the neuronal circuitry, particularly within the dorsal horn. This region receives primary afferent input from the periphery, and cortical input via the somatosensory subcomponent of the corticospinal tract (S1 CST), and is critically important in modulating sensory transmission, both in normal and lesioned states. To determine how dorsal horn circuitry alters to facilitate recovery post-injury, we used an established deafferentation lesion model (dorsal root/dorsal column) in male monkeys to remove sensory input from just the opposing digits (digits 1–3) of one hand. This results in a deficit in fine dexterity that recovers over several months. Electrophysiological mapping, tract tracing, and immunolabeling techniques were combined to delineate specific changes to dorsal horn input circuitry. Our main findings show that (1) there is complementary sprouting of the primary afferent and S1 CST populations into an overlapping region of the reorganizing dorsal horn; (2) S1 CST and primary afferent inputs connect in different ways within this region to facilitate sensory integration; and (3) there is a loss of larger S1 CST terminal boutons in the affected dorsal horn, but no change in the size profile of the spared/sprouted primary afferent terminal boutons post-lesion. Understanding such changes helps to inform new and targeted therapies that best promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spinal injuries that remove sensation from the hand, can be debilitating, though functional recovery does occur. We examined changes to the neuronal circuitry of the dorsal horn in monkeys following a lesion that deafferented three digits of one hand. Little is understood about dorsal horn circuitry, despite the fact that this region loses most of its normal input after such an injury, and is clearly a major focus of reorganization. We found that both the spared primary afferents and somatosensory corticospinal efferents sprouted in an overlapping region of the dorsal horn after injury, and that larger (presumably faster) corticospinal terminals are lost, suggesting a significantly altered cortical modulation of primary afferents. Understanding this changing circuitry is important for designing targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Glutamatergic Synaptic Clefts Alkalinize Rather Than Acidify during Neurotransmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1611?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1611?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The dogma that the synaptic cleft acidifies during neurotransmission is based on the corelease of neurotransmitters and protons from synaptic vesicles, and is supported by direct data from sensory ribbon-type synapses. However, it is unclear whether acidification occurs at non–ribbon-type synapses. Here we used genetically encoded fluorescent pH indicators to examine cleft pH at conventional neuronal synapses. At the neuromuscular junction of female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, we observed alkaline spikes of over 1 log unit during fictive locomotion &lt;i&gt;in vivo. Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;, single action potentials evoked alkalinizing pH transients of only ~0.01 log unit, but these transients summated rapidly during burst firing. A chemical pH indicator targeted to the cleft corroborated these findings. Cleft pH transients were dependent on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; movement across the postsynaptic membrane, rather than neurotransmitter release per se, a result consistent with cleft alkalinization being driven by the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporting activity of the plasma membrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase at the postsynaptic membrane. Targeting the pH indicators to the microenvironment of the presynaptic voltage gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels revealed that alkalinization also occurred within the cleft proper at the active zone and not just within extrasynaptic regions. Application of the pH indicators at the mouse calyx of Held, a mammalian central synapse, similarly revealed cleft alkalinization during burst firing in both males and females. These findings, made at two quite different non–ribbon type synapses, suggest that cleft alkalinization during neurotransmission, rather than acidification, is a generalizable phenomenon across conventional neuronal synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurotransmission is highly sensitive to the pH of the extracellular milieu. This is readily evident in the neurological symptoms that accompany systemic acid/base imbalances. Imaging data from sensory ribbon-type synapses show that neurotransmission itself can acidify the synaptic cleft, likely due to the corelease of protons and glutamate. It is not clear whether the same phenomenon occurs at conventional neuronal synapses due to the difficulties in collecting such data. If it does occur, it would provide for an additional layer of activity-dependent modulation of neurotransmission. Our findings of alkalinization, rather than acidification, within the cleft of two different neuronal synapses encourages a reassessment of the scope of activity-dependent pH influences on neurotransmission and short-term synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;SynGAP is a potent regulator of biochemical signaling in neurons and plays critical roles in neuronal function. It was first identified in 1998, and has since been extensively characterized as a mediator of synaptic plasticity. Because of its involvement in synaptic plasticity, SynGAP has emerged as a critical protein for normal cognitive function. In recent years, mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene have been shown to cause intellectual disability in humans and have been linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. While the structure and biochemical function of SynGAP have been well characterized, a unified understanding of the various roles of SynGAP at the synapse and its contributions to neuronal function remains to be achieved. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current understanding of the multifactorial role of SynGAP in regulating neuronal function gathered over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Shared physiological correlates of multisensory and expectation-based facilitation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Perceptual performance in a visual task can be enhanced by simultaneous multisensory information, but can also be enhanced by a symbolic or amodal cue inducing a specific expectation. That similar benefits can arise from multisensory information and within-modality expectation raises the question of whether the underlying neurophysiological processes are the same or distinct. We investigated this by comparing the influence of three types of auxiliary probabilistic cues on visual motion discrimination in humans: i) acoustic motion, ii) a pre-motion visual symbolic cue, iii) a post-motion symbolic cue. Using multivariate analysis of the EEG data we show that both the multisensory and preceding visual symbolic cue enhance the encoding of visual motion direction as reflected by cerebral activity arising from occipital regions around 200-400ms post-stimulus onset. This suggests a common or overlapping physiological correlate of crossmodal and intramodal auxiliary information, pointing to neural mechanism susceptive to both multisensory and more abstract probabilistic cues. We also asked how pre-stimulus activity shapes the cue-stimulus combination and found a differential influence on crossmodal and intramodal combination: while alpha power modulated the relative weight of visual motion and the acoustic cue, it did not modulate the behavioural influence of a visual symbolic cue, pointing to differences in how pre-stimulus activity shapes the combination of multisensory and abstract cues with task-relevant information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Perception can be enhanced by the combination of multisensory information and by the exploitation of amodal or symbolic cues presented within the same modality as the task-relevant information. We here asked whether the physiological correlates reflecting the behavioural benefits induced by each type of cue are similar or not. Using multivariate analysis of EEG data we show that the perceptual enhancement induced by an acoustic cue and a visual-symbolic cue for the discrimination of visual motion arise from the same physiological source. This suggests that the impact of multisensory information and more abstract sensory expectations on perception arise from shared mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: More than a corepressor: the role of CoREST proteins in neurodevelopment</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms governing normal neurodevelopment are tightly regulated by the action of transcription factors. Repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is widely documented as a regulator of neurogenesis that acts by recruiting corepressor proteins and repressing neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells. The REST corepressor 1 (CoREST1), CoREST2 and CoREST3 are best described for their role as part of the REST complex. However, recent evidence has shown the proteins have the ability to repress expression of distinct target genes in a REST-independent manner. These findings indicate that each CoREST paralogue may have distinct and critical roles in regulating neurodevelopment and are more than simply &quot;REST corepressors&quot;, whereby they act as independent repressors orchestrating biological processes during neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The molecular mechanisms governing normal development of the brain are yet to be fully elucidated. The regulation of gene expression by transcription factors plays a significant role in the specification and maturation of neurons and glia. Repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) has been well characterised as a transcriptional regulator of neurogenesis through the formation of a complex with the REST corepressor (CoREST) proteins. Recently, the CoREST protein family has been shown to independently target unique genes, have distinct expression patterns, and important REST-independent functions during neurodevelopment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governed by the CoREST family will provide insight into the regulatory networks directing normal neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synaptic clock as a neural substrate of consciousness. (arXiv:2002.07716v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07716</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07716</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study the temporal aspect of consciousness is analyzed. We start from
the notion that while conscious experience seems to change constantly, yet for
any contents of experience to be consciously perceived they must last for some
non-zero duration of time, which appears to constitute a certain conflict. We
posit that, in terms of phenomenological analysis of consciousness, the
temporal aspect, and this apparent conflict in particular, is the most basic
property, likely inherent to any conceivable form of consciousness. We then put
forward arguments for the synaptic clock to be a content-specific neural
substrate of consciousness, showing how it would correspond to this temporal
aspect. This proposal is considered in light of the information integration
theory of consciousness, and other theories that relate consciousness to
processes of learning and memory. It is outlined how this can offer a concrete
way of relating the properties of consciousness directly to the neural
plasticity mechanisms of learning and memory. In this regard, we propose a
viewpoint, in which an association between different contents of conscious
experience can be created in a form of relational memory only if they occur at
the very same moment of subjective time, with moments of subjective time having
different durations depending on the type of information processed,
proportional to the time units of corresponding synaptic clocks, and being in
principle different for different brain regions and nervous systems in
different animal species. Finally, using this viewpoint, we consider the two
alternative views on the structure of consciousness, namely a static and a
dynamic one, and argue in favor of the latter, proposing that consciousness can
be best understood if change is considered its only dimension.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose an innovative machine learning paradigm enabling precision
medicine for prioritizing cognitive assessments according to their relevance to
Alzheimer's disease at the individual patient level. The paradigm tailors the
cognitive biomarker discovery and cognitive assessment selection process to the
brain morphometric characteristics of each individual patient. We implement
this paradigm using a newly developed learning-to-rank method PLTR. Our
empirical study on the ADNI data yields promising results to identify and
prioritize individual-specific cognitive biomarkers as well as cognitive
assessment tasks based on the individual's structural MRI data. The resulting
top ranked cognitive biomarkers and assessment tasks have the potential to aid
personalized diagnosis and disease subtyping.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Integrated Information Theory is one of the leading models of consciousness.
It aims to describe both the quality and quantity of the conscious experience
of a physical system, such as the brain, in a particular state. In this
contribution, we propound the mathematical structure of the theory, separating
the essentials from auxiliary formal tools. We provide a definition of a
generalized IIT which has IIT 3.0 of Tononi et. al., as well as the Quantum IIT
introduced by Zanardi et. al. as special cases. This provides an axiomatic
definition of the theory which may serve as the starting point for future
formal investigations and as an introduction suitable for researchers with a
formal background.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although cognitive engagement (CE) is crucial for motor learning, it remains
underutilized in rehabilitation robots, partly because its assessment currently
relies on subjective and gross measurements taken intermittently. Here, we
propose an end-to-end computational framework that assesses CE in real-time,
using electroencephalography (EEG) signals as objective measurements. The
framework consists of i) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that
extracts task-discriminative spatiotemporal EEG to predict the level of CE for
two classes -- cognitively engaged vs. disengaged; and ii) a novel sliding
window method that predicts continuous levels of CE in real-time. We evaluated
our framework on 8 subjects using an in-house Go/No-Go experiment that adapted
its gameplay parameters to induce cognitive fatigue. The proposed CNN had an
average leave-one-out accuracy of 88.13\%. The CE prediction correlated well
with a commonly used behavioral metric based on self-reports taken every 5
minutes ($\rho$=0.93). Our results objectify CE in real-time and pave the way
for using CE as a rehabilitation parameter for tailoring robotic therapy to
each patient's needs and skills.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Robotic vision introduces requirements for real-time processing of
fast-varying, noisy information in a continuously changing environment. In a
real-world environment, convenient assumptions, such as static camera systems
and deep learning algorithms devouring high volumes of ideally slightly-varying
data are hard to survive. Leveraging on recent studies on the neural connectome
associated with eye movements, we designed a neuromorphic oculomotor controller
and placed it at the heart of our in-house biomimetic robotic head prototype.
The controller is unique in the sense that (1) all data are encoded and
processed by a spiking neural network (SNN), and (2) by mimicking the
associated brain areas' connectivity, the SNN required no training to operate.
A biologically-constrained Hebbian learning further improved the SNN
performance in tracking a moving target. Here, we report the tracking
performance of the robotic head and show that the robotic eye kinematics are
similar to those reported in human eye studies. This work contributes to our
ongoing effort to develop energy-efficient neuromorphic SNN and harness their
emerging intelligence to control biomimetic robots with versatility and
robustness.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02021</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We first pose the Unsupervised Progressive Learning (UPL) problem: learning
salient representations from a non-stationary stream of unlabeled data in which
the number of object classes increases with time. To solve the UPL problem we
propose an architecture that involves a module called Self-Taught Associative
Memory (STAM). Layered hierarchies of STAM modules learn based on a combination
of online clustering, novelty detection, forgetting outliers, and storing only
prototypical representations rather than specific examples. We evaluate STAM
representations using clustering and classification tasks, relying on limited
labeled data for the latter. Even though there are no prior approaches that are
directly applicable to the UPL problem, we compare the STAM architecture to a
couple of unsupervised and self-supervised deep learning approaches adapted in
the UPL context.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on many visual tasks. Recently, they became useful models for the
visual system in neuroscience. However, it is still not clear what are learned
by CNNs in terms of neuronal circuits. When a deep CNN with many layers is used
for the visual system, it is not easy to compare the structure components of
CNNs with possible neuroscience underpinnings due to highly complex circuits
from the retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing
on single retinal ganglion cells with biophysical models and recording data
from animals. By training CNNs with white noise images to predict neuronal
responses, we found that fine structures of the retinal receptive field can be
revealed. Specifically, convolutional filters learned are resembling biological
components of the retinal circuit. This suggests that a CNN learning from one
single retinal cell reveals a minimal neural network carried out in this cell.
Furthermore, when CNNs learned from different cells are transferred between
cells, there is a diversity of transfer learning performance, which indicates
that CNNs are cell-specific. Moreover, when CNNs are transferred between
different types of input images, here white noise v.s. natural images, transfer
learning shows a good performance, which implies that CNNs indeed capture the
full computational ability of a single retinal cell for different inputs. Taken
together, these results suggest that CNNs could be used to reveal structure
components of neuronal circuits, and provide a powerful model for neural system
identification.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Passive Coping Strategies During Repeated Social Defeat Are Associated With Long-Lasting Changes in Sleep in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to severe stress has immediate and prolonged neuropsychiatric consequences and increases the risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Importantly, PTSD develops in only a subset of individuals after exposure to a traumatic event, with the understanding of this selective vulnerability being very limited. Individuals who go on to develop PTSD after a traumatic experience typically demonstrate sleep disturbances including persistent insomnia and recurrent trauma-related nightmares. We previously established a repeated social defeat paradigm in which rats segregate into either passively or actively coping subpopulations, and we found that this distinction correlates with measures of vulnerability or resilience to stress. In this study, we examined differences between these two behavioral phenotypes in sleep changes resulting from repeated social defeat stress. Our data indicate that, compared to control and actively coping rats, passively coping rats have less slow-wave sleep (SWS) for at least 2 weeks after the end of a series of exposures to social defeat. Furthermore, resilient rats show less exaggerated motor activation at awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and less fragmentation of REM sleep compared to control and passively coping rats. Together, these data associate a passive coping strategy in response to repeated social defeat stress with persisting sleep disturbances. Conversely, an active coping strategy may be associated with resilience to sleep disturbances. These findings may have both prognostic and therapeutic applications to stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, including PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous sensation is vital to controlling our hands and upper limbs. It helps close the motor control loop by informing adjustments of grasping forces during object manipulations and provides much of the information the brain requires to perceive our limbs as a part of our bodies. This sensory information is absent to upper-limb prosthesis users. Although robotic prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the absence of feedback imposes a reliance on open-loop control and limits the functional potential as an integrated part of the body. Experimental systems to restore physiologically relevant sensory information to prosthesis users are beginning to emerge. However, the impact of their long-term use on functional abilities, body image, and neural adaptation processes remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential to transition sensate prostheses from sophisticated assistive tools to integrated replacement limbs. We recruited three participants with high-level upper-limb amputation who previously received targeted reinnervation surgery. Each participant was fit with a neural-machine-interface prosthesis that allowed participants to operate their device by thinking about moving their missing limb. Additionally, we fit a sensory feedback system that allowed participants to experience touch to the prosthesis as touch on their missing limb. All three participants performed a long-term take-home trial. Two participants used their neural-machine-interface systems with touch feedback and one control participant used his prescribed, insensate prosthesis. A series of functional outcome metrics and psychophysical evaluations were performed using sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses before and after the take-home period to capture changes in functional abilities, limb embodiment, and neural adaptation. Our results demonstrated that the relationship between users and sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses is dynamic and changes with long-term use. The presence of touch sensation had a near-immediate impact on how the users operated their prostheses. In the multiple independent measures of users’ functional abilities employed, we observed a spectrum of performance changes following long-term use. Furthermore, after the take-home period, participants more appropriately integrated their prostheses into their body images and psychophysical tests provided strong evidence that neural and cortical adaptation occurred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a wireless distributed Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) architecture. It is based on a set of, potentially heterogeneous, distributed stimulation and measurement units managed by a wearable controller. Through a proof-of-concept application, the characterization of the wireless network performances was assessed to check the adequacy of this solution with open-loop and closed-loop control requirements. We show the guaranteed time performances over the network through the control of quadriceps and hamstrings stimulation parameters based on the monitoring of the knee joint angle. Our solution intends to be a tool for researchers and therapists to develop closed-loop control algorithms and strategies for rehabilitation, allowing the design of wearable systems for a daily use context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders in aging. Hyposmia has been described as an early symptom that can precede cognitive and motor deficits by decades. Certain regions within the olfactory system, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, display the neuropathological markers tau and amyloid-β or α-synuclein from the earliest stages of disease progression in a preferential manner. Specific neuronal subpopulations, namely those expressing somatostatin (SST), are preferentially affected throughout the olfactory and limbic systems. SST is a neuropeptide present in a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons throughout the brain and its main function is to inhibit principal neurons and/or other interneurons. It has been reported that SST expression is reduced by 50% in Alzheimer’s disease and that it is related to the formation of Aβ oligomers. The mechanisms underlying the preferential vulnerability of SST-expressing neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (and, to a minor extent, in Parkinson’s disease) are not known but analysis of the available data could shed light on their etiology. This short review aims to update the knowledge of functional features of somatostatin within the olfactory system and its role in olfactory deficits during neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Perspectives on Cannabis-Based Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis: A Mini-Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The consistency, efficacy, and safety of cannabis-based medicines have been demonstrated in humans, leading to the approval of the first cannabis-based therapy to alleviate spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, the evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for the management of pathological events related to this disease is ever increasing. Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for cannabis-based treatments in mouse models of demyelination, such as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler’s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus-Induced Demyelinating Disease (TMEV-IDD). Cells in the immune and nervous system express the machinery to synthesize and degrade endocannabinoids, as well as their CB1 and CB2 receptors, each mediating different intracellular pathways upon activation. Hence, the effects of cannabinoids on cells of the immune system, on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons, potentially open the way for a plethora of therapeutic actions on different targets that could aid the management of MS. As such, cannabinoids could have an important impact on the outcome of MS in terms of the resolution of inflammation or the potentiation of endogenous repair in the central nervous system (CNS), as witnessed in the EAE, TMEV-IDD and toxic demyelination models, and through other in vitro approaches. In this mini review article, we summarize what is currently known about the peripheral and central effects of cannabinoids in relation to the neuroinflammation coupled to MS. We pay special attention to their effects on remyelination and axon preservation within the CNS, considering the major questions raised in the field and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: L1CAM Is a Marker for Enriching Corticospinal Motor Neurons in the Developing Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortical tissue of murine embryo and pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons can survive in the adult brain and extend axons to the spinal cord. These features suggest that cell transplantation can be a strategy to reconstruct the corticospinal tract (CST). It is unknown, however, which cell population makes for safe and effective donor cells. To address this issue, we grafted the cerebral cortex of E14.5 mouse to the brain of adult mice and found that the cells in the graft extending axons along the CST expressed CTIP2. By using CTIP2:GFP knock-in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we identified L1CAM as a cell surface marker to enrich CTIP2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. We sorted L1CAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells from E14.5 mouse brain and confirmed that they extended a larger number of axons along the CST compared to L1CAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Our results suggest that sorting L1CAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells from the embryonic cerebral cortex enriches subcortical projection neurons to reconstruct the CST.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: DIP2B Interacts With α-Tubulin to Regulate Axon Outgrowth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axonal development is essential to the establishment of neuronal morphology and circuitry, although the mechanisms underlying axonal outgrowth during the early developmental stages remain unclear. Here, we showed that the conserved disco-interacting protein B (DIP2B) which consists of a DMAP1 domain and a crotonobetaine/carnitine CoA ligase (Caic) domain, is highly expressed in the excitatory neurons of the hippocampus. DIP2B knockout led to excessive axonal outgrowth but not polarity at an early developmental stage. Furthermore, the loss of DIP2B inhibited synaptic transmission for both spontaneous and rapid release in cultured hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, DIP2B function during axonal outgrowth requires tubulin acetylation. These findings reveal a new conserved regulator of neuronal morphology and provide a novel intervention mechanism for neurocognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia among the elderly worldwide. Unfortunately, the mechanism of AD remains unclear, and no effective therapies are available yet. An increasing amount of studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a notable role in the pathogenesis of plenty of human diseases, and they have served as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, the function of LncRNAs in AD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential role of LncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in AD. We found that LncRNA NEAT1 was upregulated in the AD animal models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NEAT1 could interact with NEDD4L and promote PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)’s ubiquitination and degradation and then impaired PINK1-dependent autophagy. Collectively, the lncRNA NEAT1 promotes the pathogenesis of AD and serves as a promising novel target for pharmacological intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Feature Selection and Combination of Information in the Functional Brain Connectome for Discrimination of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Analyses of Altered Brain Patterns</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00028</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered a critical time window for predicting early conversion to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Brain functional connectome data (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides numerous information about brain networks and has been used to discriminate normal controls (NCs) from subjects with MCI. In this paper, Student’s t-tests and group-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (group-LASSO) were used to extract functional connections with significant differences and the most discriminative network nodes, respectively. Based on group-LASSO, the middle temporal, inferior temporal, lingual, posterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyri were the most predominant brain regions for nodal observation in MCI patients. Nodal graph metrics (within-module degree, participation coefficient, and degree centrality) showed the maximum discriminative ability. To effectively combine the multipattern information, we employed the multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM). Combined with functional connectome information, the MKL-SVM achieved a good classification performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve = 0.9728). Additionally, the altered brain connectome pattern revealed that functional connectivity was generally decreased in the whole-brain network, whereas graph theory topological attributes of some special nodes in the brain network were increased in MCI patients. Our findings demonstrate that optimal feature selection and combination of all connectome features (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) can achieve good performance in discriminating NCs from MCI subjects. Thus, the combination of functional connections and global and nodal graph metrics of brain networks can predict the occurrence of MCI and contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Understanding the sequence of events leading to cancer relies in large part upon identifying the tumour cell of origin. Glioblastoma is the most malignant brain cancer but the early stages of disease progression remain elusive. Neural lineages have been implicated as cells of origin, as have glia. Interestingly, high levels of the neural stem cell regulator TLX correlate with poor patient prognosis. Here we show that high levels of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; TLX homologue, Tailless, initiate tumourigenesis by reverting intermediate neural progenitors to a stem cell state. Strikingly, we could block tumour formation completely by re-expressing Asense (homologue of human ASCL1), which we show is a direct target of Tailless. Our results predict that expression of TLX and ASCL1 should be mutually exclusive in glioblastoma, which was verified in single-cell RNA-seq of human glioblastoma samples. Counteracting high TLX is a potential therapeutic strategy for suppressing tumours originating from intermediate progenitor cells.</description>

	<description>Perturbation of neuronal activity is key to understanding the brain's functional properties, however, intervention studies typically perturb neurons in a nonspecific manner. Recent optogenetics techniques have enabled patterned perturbations, in which specific patterns of activity can be invoked in identified target neurons to reveal more specific cortical function. Here, we argue that patterned perturbation of neurons is in fact necessary to reveal the specific dynamics of inhibitory stabilization, emerging in cortical networks with strong excitatory and inhibitory functional subnetworks, as recently reported in mouse visual cortex. We propose a specific perturbative signature of these networks and investigate how this can be measured under different experimental conditions. Functionally, rapid spontaneous transitions between selective ensembles of neurons emerge in such networks, consistent with experimental results. Our study outlines the dynamical and functional properties of feature-specific inhibitory-stabilized networks, and suggests experimental protocols that can be used to detect them in the intact cortex.</description>

	<description>The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day. This health epidemic demands innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids. These changes implicate the brainstem's breathing circuitry which we confirm by locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the preBötzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic tools to reveal that just 70-140 neurons in this region are responsible for its sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Presynaptic GABAB receptors functionally uncouple somatostatin interneurons from the active hippocampal network</title>

	<description>Information processing in cortical neuronal networks relies on properly balanced excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. A ubiquitous motif for maintaining this balance is the somatostatin interneuron (SOM-IN) feedback microcircuit. Here, we investigate the modulation of this microcircuit by presynaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) in the rodent hippocampus. Whole-cell recordings from SOM-INs revealed that both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are strongly inhibited by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, while optogenetic activation of the interneurons shows that their inhibitory output is also strongly suppressed. Electron microscopic analysis of immunogold-labelled freeze-fracture replicas confirms that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are highly expressed presynaptically at both input and output synapses of SOM-INs. Activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs selectively suppresses the recruitment of SOM-INs during gamma oscillations induced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, axonal GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are positioned to efficiently control the input and output synapses of SOM-INs and can functionally uncouple them from local network with implications for rhythmogenesis and the balance of entorhinal versus intrahippocampal afferents.</description>

	<description>As the general population ages, more people are affected by eye diseases, such as retinopathies. It is therefore critical to improve imaging of eye disease mouse models. Here, we demonstrate that 1) rapid, quantitative 3D and 4D (time lapse) imaging of cellular and subcellular processes in the mouse eye is feasible, with and without tissue clearing, using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM); 2) flat-mounting retinas for confocal microscopy significantly distorts tissue morphology, confirmed by quantitative correlative LSFM-Confocal imaging of vessels; 3) LSFM readily reveals new features of even well-studied eye disease mouse models, such as the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, including a previously unappreciated 'knotted' morphology to pathological vascular tufts, abnormal cell motility and altered filopodia dynamics when live-imaged. We conclude that quantitative 3D/4D LSFM imaging and analysis has the potential to advance our understanding of the eye, in particular pathological, neuro-vascular, degenerative processes.</description>

	<description>Mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins cause many neurodevelopmental disorders, with the majority affecting postsynaptic apparatuses and much fewer in presynaptic proteins. Syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1, also known as MUNC18-1) is an essential component of the presynaptic neurotransmitter release machinery. &lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;STXBP1&lt;/i&gt; are among the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disabilities and epilepsies. These disorders, collectively referred to as &lt;i&gt;STXBP1&lt;/i&gt; encephalopathy, encompass a broad spectrum of neurologic and psychiatric features, but the pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we modeled &lt;i&gt;STXBP1&lt;/i&gt; encephalopathy in mice and found that &lt;i&gt;Stxbp1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficiency caused cognitive, psychiatric, and motor dysfunctions, as well as cortical hyperexcitability and seizures. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Stxbp1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficiency reduced cortical inhibitory neurotransmission via distinct mechanisms from parvalbumin-expressing and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. These results demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Stxbp1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficient mice recapitulate cardinal features of &lt;i&gt;STXBP1&lt;/i&gt; encephalopathy and indicate that GABAergic synaptic dysfunction is likely a crucial contributor to disease pathogenesis.</description>

	<description>Balance between excitation and inhibition (E-I balance) in neural circuits is believed to be tightly regulated. To the contrary, in this issue of Neuron, Bridi et al. (2020) reveal that inverse oscillations of synaptic inhibition and excitation lead to peaks and valleys in E-I balance across the 24 h day.</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Ashrafi et al. (2020) identify a feedforward signaling mechanism that couples neuronal activity to the homeostatic maintenance of axonal and synaptic ATP production. This mechanism is achieved via changes in cytoplasmic calcium and activation of brain-specific, mitochondrial MICU3.</description>

	<description>Science is evolving, and Cell Press is evolving too. You may have already noticed some of our growth and development, but this month we are moving into a new phase by rolling out the first elements of a new look for all of Cell Press. We have a new logo, a new color scheme that is unified across all that we do, and an underlying ethos that looks to the future of science and its role in society. We are a broader and more diverse organization than we used to be, with coverage across many scientific disciplines, and we have reached a point in our evolution where this type of external change is overdue.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prediction of Essential Binding Domains for the Endocannabinoid N-Arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) in the Brain Cannabinoid CB1 receptor</title>

	<description>{Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({Delta}9-THC), the main active ingredient of Cannabis sativa (marijuana), interacts with the human brain cannabinoid (CB1) receptor and mimics pharmacological effects of endocannabinoids (eCBs) N-arachidonylethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Given recent intriguing findings that some allosteric modulators can enhance selectively the AEA-activated CB1 receptor, it is imperative to determine the structure of the AEA-bound CB1 receptor. However, due to its highly flexible nature of AEA, establishing its binding mode to the CB1 receptor is elusive. The aim of the present study was to explore many possible binding conformations of AEA within the binding pocket of the CB1 receptor that is confirmed in the recently available X-ray crystal structures of the agonist-bound CB1 receptors and predict essential AEA binding domains. We performed long time molecular dynamics stimulations of plausible AEA docking poses until its receptor binding interactions became optimally established. Our simulation results revealed that AEA favors to bind to the hydrophobic channel of the CB1 receptor, suggesting that the hydrophobic channel holds essential significance in AEA binding to the CB1 receptor. Our results also suggest that the H2/H3 region of the CB1 receptor is an AEA binding subsite privileged possibly over the H7 region. The results of the present study contribute to identifying the (hidden) allosteric site(s) of the CB1 receptor in our immediate future study.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pupil dilation is sensitive to semantic ambiguity and acoustic degradation</title>

	<description>Speech comprehension is often challenged by background noise or other acoustic interference. It can also be challenged by linguistic factors, such as complex syntax, or the presence of words with more than one meaning. Pupillometry is increasingly recognized as a technique that provides a window onto acoustic challenges, but this work has not been well integrated with an older literature linking pupil dilation to &quot;mental effort&quot;, which would include linguistic challenges. Here, we measured pupil dilation while listeners heard spoken sentences with clear sentence-level meaning that contained words with more than one meaning (&quot;The shell was fired towards the tank&quot;) or matched sentences without ambiguous words (&quot;Her secrets were written in her diary&quot;). This semantic-ambiguity manipulation was crossed with an acoustic manipulation: two levels of a 30-talker babble masker in Experiment 1; and presence or absence of a pink noise masker in Experiment 2. Speech comprehension, indexed by a semantic relatedness task, was high (above 82% correct) in all conditions. Pupils dilated when sentences included semantically ambiguous words compared to matched sentences and when maskers were present compared to absent (Experiment 2) or were more compared to less intense (Experiment 1). The current results reinforce the idea that many different challenges to speech comprehension, that afford different cognitive processes and are met by the brain in different ways, manifest as an increase in pupil dilation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The brain of Cataglyphis ants: neuronal organization and visual projections</title>

	<description>Cataglyphis ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far-reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision-based navigation in Cataglyphis requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although Cataglyphis ants have been subject to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three-dimensional neuronal map of synapse-rich neuropils in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Input connectivity reveals additional heterogeneity of dopaminergic reinforcement in Drosophila</title>

	<description>Different types of Drosophila dopaminergic neurons (DANs) reinforce memories of unique valence and provide state-dependent motivational control [1]. Prior studies suggest that the compartment architecture of the mushroom body (MB) is the relevant resolution for distinct DAN functions [2, 3]. Here we used a recent electron microscope volume of the fly brain [4] to reconstruct the fine anatomy of individual DANs within three MB compartments. We find the 20 DANs of the {gamma}5 compartment, at least some of which provide reward teaching signals, can be clustered into 5 anatomical subtypes that innervate different regions within {gamma}5. Reconstructing 821 upstream neurons reveals input selectivity, supporting the functional relevance of DAN sub-classification. Only one PAM-{gamma}5 DAN subtype ({gamma}5fb) receives direct recurrent input from {gamma}5{beta}'2a mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and behavioral experiments distinguish a role for these DANs in memory revaluation from those reinforcing sugar memory. Other DAN subtypes receive major, and potentially reinforcing, inputs from putative gustatory interneurons or lateral horn neurons, which can also relay indirect feedback from the MB. We similarly reconstructed the single aversively reinforcing PPL1-{gamma}1pedc DAN. The {gamma}1pedc DAN inputs are mostly different to those of {gamma}5 DANs and are clustered onto distinct branches of its dendritic tree, presumably separating its established roles in aversive reinforcement and appetitive motivation [5, 6]. Additional tracing identified neurons that provide broad input to {gamma}5, {beta}'2a and {gamma}1pedc DANs suggesting that distributed DAN populations can be coordinately regulated. These connectomic and behavioral analyses therefore reveal additional complexity of dopaminergic reinforcement circuits between and within MB compartments.</description>

	<description>Unlike mammals, adult zebrafish undergo spontaneous recovery after major spinal cord injury. Whereas scarring presents a roadblock for mammalian spinal cord repair, glial cells in zebrafish form a bridge across severed spinal cord tissue to facilitate regeneration. Here, we performed FACS sorting and genome-wide profiling to determine the transcriptional identity of purified bridging glia. We found that Yap-Ctgf signaling activates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in localized niches of ependymal cells to promote glial bridging and regeneration. Preferentially activated in early bridging glia, Yap is required for the expression of the glial bridging factor Ctgfa and for functional spinal cord repair. Ctgfa regulation is controlled by an injury responsive enhancer element that drives expression in early bridging glia after injury. Yap-Ctgf signaling activates a mesenchymal transcriptional program that drives glial bridging. This study revealed the molecular signatures of bridging glia and identified an injury responsive gene regulatory network that promotes spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish.</description>

	<description>The posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) is necessary for goal-directed action, however the role of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) spiny projection neurons in the pDMS in such action remains unclear. In this series of experiments, we examined the role of pDMS SPNs in goal-directed action and found that, whereas dSPNs were critical for goal-directed learning and for energizing the learned response, iSPNs were involved in updating that learning to support response flexibility. Instrumental training elevated expression of the plasticity marker Zif268 in dSPNs only, and chemogenetic suppression of dSPN activity during training prevented goal-directed learning. Unilateral optogenetic inhibition of dSPNs induced an ipsilateral response bias in goal-directed action performance. In contrast, although initial goal-directed learning was unaffected by iSPN manipulations, optogenetic inhibition of iSPNs, but not dSPNs, impaired the updating of this learning and attenuated response flexibility after changes in the action-outcome contingency.</description>

	<description>Nervous systems extract and process information from their environment to alter animal behavior and physiology. Despite progress in understanding how different stimuli are represented by changes in neuronal activity, less is known about how they affect broader neural network properties. We developed a framework to use graph-theoretic features of neural network activity and predict ecologically-relevant stimulus properties namely, stimulus identity and valence. Specifically, we used the transparent nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, with its small nervous system, to define neural network features associated with various chemosensory stimuli. We trapped animals using a microfluidic device and exposed their noses to chemical stimuli known to be attractive or repellent, while monitoring changes in neural activity in more than 40 neurons in their heads. We found that repellents trigger higher average neural activity across the network, and that the tastant salt increases neural variability. In contrast, graph-theoretic features, which capture patterns of interactions between neurons, are better suited to decode stimulus identity than measures of neural activity. Furthermore, we show that a simple machine learning classifier trained using graph-theoretic features alone or in combination with neural activity features can accurately predict stimulus identity. These results indicate that graph theory reveals network characteristics that are distinct from neural activity, confirming its utility in extracting stimulus properties from neural population data.</description>

	<description>Understanding of neuronal circuitry at cellular resolution within the brain has relied on tract tracing methods which involve careful observation and interpretation by experienced neuroscientists. With recent developments in imaging and digitization, this approach is no longer feasible with the large scale (terabyte to petabyte range) images. Machine learning based techniques, using deep networks, provide an efficient alternative to the problem. However, these methods rely on very large volumes of annotated images for training and have error rates that are too high for scientific data analysis, and thus requires a significant volume of human-in-the-loop proofreading. Here we introduce a hybrid architecture combining prior structure in the form of topological data analysis methods, based on discrete Morse theory, with the best-in-class deep-net architectures for the neuronal connectivity analysis. We show significant performance gains using our hybrid architecture on detection of topological structure (e.g. connectivity of neuronal processes and local intensity maxima on axons corresponding to synaptic swellings) with precision/recall close to 90% compared with human observers. We have adapted our architecture to a high performance pipeline capable of semantic segmentation of light microscopic whole-brain image data into a hierarchy of neuronal compartments. We expect that the hybrid architecture incorporating discrete Morse techniques into deep nets will generalize to other data domains.</description>

	<description>Adolescence is a sensitive window for reward- and stress-associated behavior. Although stress during this period causes long-term changes in behavior in males, how females respond is relatively unknown. Here we show that social isolation stress in adolescence, but not adulthood, induces persistent but opposite effects on anxiety- and cocaine-related behaviors in male vs. female mice, and that these effects are reflected in transcriptional profiles within the adult medial amygdala (meA). By integrating differential gene expression with co-expression network analyses, we identified crystallin mu (Crym), a thyroid-binding protein, as a key driver of these transcriptional profiles. Manipulation of Crym specifically within adult meA neurons recapitulates the behavioral and transcriptional effects of social isolation and re-opens a window of plasticity that is otherwise closed. Our results establish that meA is essential for sex-specific responses to stressful and rewarding stimuli through transcriptional programming that occurs during adolescence.</description>

	<description>Studies of large-scale brain organization have revealed interesting relationships between spatial gradients in brain maps across multiple modalities. Evaluating the significance of these findings requires establishing statistical expectations under a null hypothesis of interest. Through generative modeling of synthetic data that instantiate a specific null hypothesis, quantitative benchmarks can be derived for arbitrarily complex statistical measures. Here, we present a generative null model, provided as an open-access software platform, that generates surrogate maps with spatial autocorrelation (SA) matched to SA of a target brain map. SA is a prominent and ubiquitous property of brain maps that violates assumptions of independence in conventional statistical tests. Our method can simulate surrogate brain maps, constrained by empirical data, that preserve the SA of cortical, subcortical, parcellated, and dense brain maps. We characterize how SA impacts p-values in pairwise brain map comparisons. Furthermore, we demonstrate how SA-preserving surrogate maps can be used in gene ontology enrichment analyses to test hypotheses of interest related to brain map topography. Our findings demonstrate the utility of SA-preserving surrogate maps for hypothesis testing in complex statistical analyses, and underscore the need to disambiguate meaningful relationships from chance associations in studies of large-scale brain organization.</description>

	<description>Reading is a rapid, distributed process that engages multiple components of the ventral visual stream. However, the neural constituents and their interactions that allow us to identify written words are not well understood. Using direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort of humans, we comprehensively isolated the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual word recognition across the entire left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. The mid-fusiform cortex is the first region that is sensitive to word identity and to both sub-lexical and lexical frequencies. Its activation, response latency and amplitude, are highly dependent on the statistics of natural language. Information about lexicality and word frequency propagates posteriorly from this region to traditional visual word form regions and to earlier visual cortex. This unique sensitivity of mid-fusiform cortex to the lexical characteristics of written words points to its central role as an orthographic lexicon, which accesses the long-term memory representations of visual word forms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Analysis of Circulating Exosomes Reveals a Peripheral Signature of Astrocytic Pathology in Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>There is considerable interest in identifying peripheral biomarkers of schizophrenia. Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles that are secreted into intracellular space and cross the blood brain barrier with their contents intact. Exosomes and their cargo, including lipids, proteins and genetic materials can be assayed peripherally. Studies of circulating exosomes have led to a greater understanding of their role as markers and mediators of pathology in neurodegenerative disorders, but there is scarce data in schizophrenia. We examined neuropathology relevant protein biomarkers in circulating exosomes obtained from patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy controls. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine the size and concentration of exosomes. Exosomal membrane marker (CD9) and specific target cargo protein (glial fibrillary acid protein[GFAP], synaptophysin and alpha-II-spectrin) immunopositivity was examined using Western blot analyses. No group differences were observed in plasma exosomal concentration and size. Exosomal GFAP expression was significantly higher in schizophrenia compared to controls. In contrast, there were no group differences observed for exosomal synaptophysin and alpha-II-spectrin. Our results demonstrate for the first time, a differential pattern of exosomal protein expression in schizophrenia compared to matched healthy controls. Schizophrenia patients had greater exosomal GFAP expression, a finding that is consistent with the known astro-glial pathology in this disorder. This finding is particularly significant given the absence of group differences in the other exosomal markers and proteins assessed in this study. These results warrant further examination of circulating exosomes as vehicles of novel peripheral biomarkers of disease in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>To study mechanisms of perception and cognition, neural measurements must be made during behavior. A goal of the Allen Brain Observatory is to map activity in distinct cortical cell classes during visual processing and behavior. Here we characterize learning and performance of five GCaMP6-expressing transgenic lines trained on a visual change detection task. We used automated training procedures to facilitate comparisons across mice. Training times varied, but most transgenic mice learned the task. Motivation levels also varied across mice. To compare mice in similar motivational states we subdivided sessions into over-, under-, and optimally motivated periods. When motivated, the pattern of perceptual decisions were highly correlated across transgenic lines, although overall d-prime was lower in one line labeling somatostatin inhibitory cells. These results provide important context for using these mice to map neural activity underlying perception and behavior.</description>

	<description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a preferential involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons. Evidence from neuroimaging and post-mortem studies confirms additional involvement of brain regions extending beyond the motor cortex. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of cerebral disease in ALS cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and to compare the findings with a recently proposed disease-staging model of ALS pathology. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) was used to identify the patterns of brain atrophy associated with ALS and to assess their relationship with clinical symptoms. Longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data and clinical measures were acquired at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months, from 66 ALS patients and 43 age-matched controls who participated in the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC) study. Whole brain voxel-wise mixed-effects modelling analysis showed extensive atrophy patterns differentiating ALS patients from the normal controls. Cerebral atrophy was present in the motor cortex and corticospinal tract, involving both GM and WM, and to a lesser extent in non-motor regions. More specifically, the results showed significant bilateral atrophy in the motor cortex, the corticospinal tract including the internal capsule and brainstem, with an overall pattern of ventricular enlargement; along with significant progressive longitudinal atrophy in the precentral gyrus, frontal and parietal white matter, accompanied by ventricular and sulcal enlargement. Atrophy in the precentral gyrus was significantly associated with greater disability as quantified with the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) (p&amp;lt;0.0001). The pattern of atrophy observed using DBM was consistent with the Brettschneider four stage pathological model of the disease. Deformation based morphometry provides a sensitive indicator of atrophy in ALS, and has potential as a biomarker of disease burden, in both gray and white matter.</description>

	<description>Latent sensitization is a long-term model of chronic pain in which pain sensitivity is continuously suppressed by opioid receptors. This is demonstrated by the induction of mechanical allodynia by opioid antagonists, something that occurs in animals with latent sensitization but not in normal animals. Different intracellular signals may mediate the initiation, maintenance and expression of latent sensitization. As a criterion for the involvement of a signal in the maintenance of latent sensitization, we proposed that inhibitors of that signal should permanently eliminate the induction of allodynia by an opioid antagonist. Since latent sensitization requires NMDA receptors, which are potentiated by Src family kinases (SFKs), we hypothesized that SFKs maintain latent sensitization. We tested this hypothesis in rats with latent sensitization induced in one hindpaw by the inflammatory agent complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or by spared nerve injury. After von Frey measures of mechanical allodynia returned to baseline, vehicle or the SFK inhibitor PP2 were injected intrathecally. The opioid antagonist naltrexone injected intrathecally 15 min later produced allodynia in control rats but not in rats injected with PP2. PP2 or vehicle were injected daily for two more days and naltrexone was injected intrathecally five days later. Again, naltrexone induced allodynia in the control rats but not in the rats injected with PP2. Results were similar when latent sensitization was induced either with CFA and spared nerve injury. We concluded that a SFK, probably Fyn, maintains latent sensitization induced by inflammation or nerve injury.</description>

	<description>Current treatments for obesity are unable to reliably reduce weight over time and alternative treatments need to address this challenge. New interventions that target the nervous system could manipulate brain networks underlying reward, metabolic rate and behavior. Here, the ventral pallidum was evaluated as a target of manipulation due to its established role in the networks underlying motivation, pleasure and behavioral output. Chronic inhibitory or excitatory chemogenetic activation was used to modulate the activity of ventral pallidum (VP) targeted neurons in rats on an obesogenic diet. We hypothesized that inhibition of VP activity would decrease the salience of the rats' high-sugar, high-fat diet and lead to reduced food consumption and weight gain over time. Paradoxically, measurements of weight, water and food consumption revealed significantly increased weight gain in both groups receiving VP targeted manipulation that was not readily explained by food or water consumption. We theorize that the complex reciprocal feedback between ventral striatal structures (e.g., VP) and metabolic centers of the hypothalamus and brainstem, demonstrated by prior research, likely underpin our findings. This study suggests that the treatment of appetitive disorders (e.g., obesity) with chronic neuromodulation-based interventions could be burdened by the delayed onset of outcomes that are difficult to predict from related prior studies that used acute interventions.</description>

Selecting goals and successfully pursuing them in an uncertain and dynamic environment is an important aspect of human behaviour. In order to decide which goal to pursue at what point in time, one has to evaluate the consequences of one’s actions over future time steps by forward planning. However, when the goal is still temporally distant, detailed forward planning can be prohibitively costly. One way to select actions at minimal computational costs is to use heuristics. It is an open question how humans mix heuristics with forward planning to balance computational costs with goal reaching performance. To test a hypothesis about dynamic mixing of heuristics with forward planning, we used a novel stochastic sequential two-goal task. Comparing participants’ decisions with an optimal full planning agent, we found that at the early stages of goal-reaching sequences, in which both goals are temporally distant and planning complexity is high, on average 42% (SD = 19%) of participants’ choices deviated from the agent’s optimal choices. Only towards the end of the sequence, participant’s behaviour converged to near optimal performance. Subsequent model-based analyses showed that participants used heuristic preferences when the goal was temporally distant and switched to forward planning when the goal was close.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Li469oKS05g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Early prediction of antigenic transitions for influenza A/H3N2</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lauren A. Castro, Trevor Bedford, Lauren Ancel Meyers&lt;/p&gt;

Influenza A/H3N2 is a rapidly evolving virus which experiences major antigenic transitions every two to eight years. Anticipating the timing and outcome of transitions is critical to developing effective seasonal influenza vaccines. Using a published phylodynamic model of influenza transmission, we identified indicators of future evolutionary success for an emerging antigenic cluster and quantified fundamental trade-offs in our ability to make such predictions. The eventual fate of a new cluster depends on its initial epidemiological growth rate––which is a function of mutational load and population susceptibility to the cluster––along with the variance in growth rate across co-circulating viruses. Logistic regression can predict whether a cluster at 5% relative frequency will eventually succeed with ~80% sensitivity, providing up to eight months advance warning. As a cluster expands, the predictions improve while the lead-time for vaccine development and other interventions decreases. However, attempts to make comparable predictions from 12 years of &lt;i&gt;empirical&lt;/i&gt; influenza surveillance data, which are far sparser and more coarse-grained, achieve only 56% sensitivity. By expanding influenza surveillance to obtain more granular estimates of the frequencies of and population-wide susceptibility to emerging viruses, we can better anticipate major antigenic transitions. This provides added incentives for accelerating the vaccine production cycle to reduce the lead time required for strain selection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvRt_QEk7t8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

English Wikipedia, containing more than five millions articles, has approximately eleven thousands web pages devoted to proteins or genes most of which were generated by the Gene Wiki project. These pages contain information about interactions between proteins and their functional relationships. At the same time, they are interconnected with other Wikipedia pages describing biological functions, diseases, drugs and other topics curated by independent, not coordinated collective efforts. Therefore, Wikipedia contains a directed network of protein functional relations or physical interactions embedded into the global network of the encyclopedia terms, which defines hidden (indirect) functional proximity between proteins. We applied the recently developed reduced Google Matrix (REGOMAX) algorithm in order to extract the network of hidden functional connections between proteins in Wikipedia. In this network we discovered tight communities which reflect areas of interest in molecular biology or medicine and can be considered as definitions of biological functions shaped by collective intelligence. Moreover, by comparing two snapshots of Wikipedia graph (from years 2013 and 2017), we studied the evolution of the network of direct and hidden protein connections. We concluded that the hidden connections are more dynamic compared to the direct ones and that the size of the hidden interaction communities grows with time. We recapitulate the results of Wikipedia protein community analysis and annotation in the form of an interactive online map, which can serve as a portal to the Gene Wiki project.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XcU5tOwpDGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Methods for the analysis of time series single cell expression data (scRNA-Seq) either do not utilize information about transcription factors (TFs) and their targets or only study these as a post-processing step. Using such information can both, improve the accuracy of the reconstructed model and cell assignments, while at the same time provide information on how and when the process is regulated. We developed the Continuous-State Hidden Markov Models TF (CSHMM-TF) method which integrates probabilistic modeling of scRNA-Seq data with the ability to assign TFs to specific activation points in the model. TFs are assumed to influence the emission probabilities for cells assigned to later time points allowing us to identify not just the TFs controlling each path but also their order of activation. We tested CSHMM-TF on several mouse and human datasets. As we show, the method was able to identify known and novel TFs for all processes, assigned time of activation agrees with both expression information and prior knowledge and combinatorial predictions are supported by known interactions. We also show that CSHMM-TF improves upon prior methods that do not utilize TF-gene interaction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5niHEV2Zq3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Most current analysis tools for antibody next-generation sequencing data work with primary sequence descriptors, leaving accompanying structural information unharnessed. We have used novel rapid methods to structurally characterize the complementary-determining regions (CDRs) of more than 180 million human and mouse B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequences. These structurally annotated CDRs provide unprecedented insights into both the structural predetermination and dynamics of the adaptive immune response. We show that B-cell types can be distinguished based solely on these structural properties. Antigen-unexperienced BCR repertoires use the highest number and diversity of CDR structures and these patterns of naïve repertoire paratope usage are highly conserved across subjects. In contrast, more differentiated B-cells are more personalized in terms of CDR structure usage. Our results establish the CDR structure differences in BCR repertoires and have applications for many fields including immunodiagnostics, phage display library generation, and “humanness” assessment of BCR repertoires from transgenic animals. The software tool for structural annotation of BCR repertoires, SAAB+, is available at https://github.com/oxpig/saab_plus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gEidztk3Y3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of adaptation in generating monotonic rate codes in auditory cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Hoon Lee, Xiaoqin Wang, Daniel Bendor&lt;/p&gt;

In primary auditory cortex, slowly repeated acoustic events are represented temporally by the stimulus-locked activity of single neurons. Single-unit studies in awake marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have shown that a sub-population of these neurons also monotonically increase or decrease their average discharge rate during stimulus presentation for higher repetition rates. Building on a computational single-neuron model that generates stimulus-locked responses with stimulus evoked excitation followed by strong inhibition, we find that stimulus-evoked short-term depression is sufficient to produce synchronized monotonic positive and negative responses to slowly repeated stimuli. By exploring model robustness and comparing it to other models for adaptation to such stimuli, we conclude that short-term depression best explains our observations in single-unit recordings in awake marmosets. Together, our results show how a simple biophysical mechanism in single neurons can generate complementary neural codes for acoustic stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CRJ_sONstjo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by W. Jeffrey Johnston, Stephanie E. Palmer, David J. Freedman&lt;/p&gt;

Neuronal activity in the brain is variable, yet both perception and behavior are generally reliable. How does the brain achieve this? Here, we show that the conjunctive coding of multiple stimulus features, commonly known as nonlinear mixed selectivity, may be used by the brain to support reliable information transmission using unreliable neurons. Nonlinearly mixed feature representations have been observed throughout primary sensory, decision-making, and motor brain areas. In these areas, different features are almost always nonlinearly mixed to some degree, rather than represented separately or with only additive (linear) mixing, which we refer to as pure selectivity. Mixed selectivity has been previously shown to support flexible linear decoding for complex behavioral tasks. Here, we show that it has another important benefit: in many cases, it makes orders of magnitude fewer decoding errors than pure selectivity even when both forms of selectivity use the same number of spikes. This benefit holds for sensory, motor, and more abstract, cognitive representations. Further, we show experimental evidence that mixed selectivity exists in the brain even when it does not enable behaviorally useful linear decoding. This suggests that nonlinear mixed selectivity may be a general coding scheme exploited by the brain for reliable and efficient neural computation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ry83og62uB8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Malaria is an infectious disease that affects over 216 million people worldwide, killing over 445,000 patients annually. Due to the constant emergence of parasitic resistance to the current antimalarial drugs, the discovery of new drug candidates is a major global health priority. Aiming to make the drug discovery processes faster and less expensive, we developed binary and continuous Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models implementing deep learning for predicting antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity of untested compounds. Then, we applied the best models for a virtual screening of a large database of chemical compounds. The top computational predictions were evaluated experimentally against asexual blood stages of both sensitive and multi-drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strains. Among them, two compounds, LabMol-149 and LabMol-152, showed potent antiplasmodial activity at low nanomolar concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;500 nM) and low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. Therefore, the computational approach employing deep learning developed here allowed us to discover two new families of potential next generation antimalarial agents, which are in compliance with the guidelines and criteria for antimalarial target candidates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WlASIxcs2hI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Significant maturation of swimming in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) occurs within the first few days of life when fish transition from coiling movements to burst swimming and then to beat-and-glide swimming. This maturation occurs against a backdrop of numerous developmental changes - neurogenesis, a transition from predominantly electrical to chemical-based neurotransmission, and refinement of intrinsic properties. There is evidence that spinal locomotor circuits undergo fundamental changes as the zebrafish transitions from burst to beat-and-glide swimming. Our electrophysiological recordings confirm that the operation of spinal locomotor circuits becomes increasingly reliant on glycinergic neurotransmission for rhythmogenesis governing the rhythm of tail beats. This transition occurred at the same time that we observed a change in rhythmicity of synaptic inhibition to spinal motoneurons (MNs). When we examined whether the transition from weakly to strongly glycinergic dependent rhythmogenesis occurred at a uniform pace across the length of the spinal cord, we found that this transition occurred earlier at caudal segments than at rostral segments of the spinal cord. Furthermore, while this rhythmogenic transition occurred when fish transition from burst swimming to beat-and-glide swimming, these two transitions were not interdependent. These results suggest that there is a developmental transition in the operation of spinal locomotor circuits that is gradually set in place in the spinal cord in a caudo-rostral temporal sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: CRPS Is Not Associated with Altered Sensorimotor Cortex GABA or Glutamate</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating chronic pain disorder typically in the upper or lower limbs. While CRPS usually develops from a peripheral event, it is likely maintained by CNS changes. Indeed, CRPS is reported to be associated with sensorimotor cortex changes, or functional &quot;reorganization,&quot; as well as deficits such as poor tactile acuity. While the mechanisms underpinning cortical reorganization in CRPS are unknown, some have hypothesized that it involves disinhibition (i.e., a reduction in GABA activity). In this study, we addressed this hypothesis by using edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine sensorimotor GABA and glutamate concentrations in 16 humans with CRPS and 30 matched control subjects and the relationship of these concentrations with tactile acuity. We found that individuals with upper limb CRPS displayed reduced tactile acuity in the painful hand, compared with the nonpainful hand and pain-free control subjects. Despite this acuity deficit, CRPS was not associated with altered GABA or glutamate concentrations within the sensorimotor cortex on either the side that represents the affected or unaffected hand. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations and tactile acuity in CRPS subjects or control subjects. Although our sample was small, these data suggest that CRPS is not associated with altered total sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations. While these results are at odds with the sensorimotor cortex disinhibition hypothesis, it is possible that GABAergic mechanisms other than total GABA concentration may contribute to such disinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The Operant Plantar Thermal Assay: A Novel Device for Assessing Thermal Pain Tolerance in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pain is a multi-dimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the Operant Planter Thermal Assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of utilizing the OPTA to assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The translation of novel pain management techniques has been hindered, in part, by reliance on pre-clinical models that do not to measure the multi-dimensional experience of pain. Here we present a novel device and protocol to assess pain tolerance in the mouse. We show that pain tolerance is a dynamic behavior influenced by sex, that hypersensitivity does not necessarily predict pain tolerance, and that analgesics that reduce hypersensitivity may not enhance pain tolerance. This approach increases the capability to pursue new directions in basic pain research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin have both been investigated in clinical trials designed to treat the cognitive deficits associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Neurofibromatosis type 1, Fragile X and autism. In a recent study, the therapeutic efficacy of lovastatin and simvastatin were compared in a Fragile X (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;) mouse model. The authors concluded that lovastatin was superior to simvastatin in rescuing the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes, and cautioned against considering simvastatin as treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders. We discuss these findings in the context of published literature and argue that more support is needed for this potentially far-reaching conclusion. We further provide recommendations to improve the translation of pre-clinical studies of cognitive disorders into the clinical domain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in computational models of signal propagation and routing in
the human brain have underscored the critical role of white matter structure. A
complementary approach has utilized the framework of network control theory to
better understand how white matter constrains the manner in which a region or
set of regions can direct or control the activity of other regions. Despite the
potential for both of these approaches to enhance our understanding of the role
of network structure in brain function, little work has sought to understand
the relations between them. Here, we seek to explicitly bridge computational
models of communication and principles of network control in a conceptual
review of the current literature. By drawing comparisons between communication
and control models in terms of the level of abstraction, the dynamical
complexity, the dependence on network attributes, and the interplay of multiple
spatiotemporal scales, we highlight the convergence of and distinctions between
the two frameworks. Based on the understanding of the intertwined nature of
communication and control in human brain networks, this work provides an
integrative perspective for the field and outlines exciting directions for
future work.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) has motivated a parallel
endeavor: the design of adversaries that profit from successful
misclassifications. However, not all adversarial examples are crafted for
malicious purposes. For example, real world systems often contain physical,
temporal, and sampling variability across instrumentation. Adversarial examples
in the wild may inadvertently prove deleterious for accurate predictive
modeling. Conversely, naturally occurring covariance of image features may
serve didactic purposes. Here, we studied the stability of deep learning
representations for neuroimaging classification across didactic and adversarial
conditions characteristic of MRI acquisition variability. We show that
representational similarity and performance vary according to the frequency of
adversarial examples in the input space.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain displays rich communication dynamics that are thought to be
particularly well-reflected in its marked community structure. Yet, the precise
relationship between community structure in structural brain networks and the
communication dynamics that can emerge therefrom is not well-understood. In
addition to offering insight into the structure-function relationship of
networked systems, such an understanding is a critical step towards the ability
to perform targeted manipulation of the brain's large-scale dynamical activity.
In this paper, we investigate the role of community structure in the
controllability of structural brain networks. At the region level, we find that
certain network measures of community structure are sometimes statistically
correlated with measures of linear controllability. However, we then
demonstrate that this relationship depends heavily on edge weight distribution.
We highlight the complexity of the relationship between community structure and
controllability by performing numerical simulations using canonical graph
models with varying mesoscale architectures and edge weight distributions.
Finally, we put forth a node-level metric rooted in the spectrum of the network
adjacency matrix that is statistically correlated with controllability
regardless of the distribution of edge weights. Our study contributes to an
understanding of how the brain's diverse structural architecture supports
transient communication dynamics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a ribonuclear protein regulating many aspects of RNA metabolism. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with the presence of TDP-43 aggregates in neuronal cells. Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway participating in the proteostasis of several cytosolic proteins including neurodegenerative associated proteins. In addition, protein oligomers or aggregates can affect the status of CMA. In this work, we studied the relationship between CMA and the physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43. First, we found that recombinant TDP-43 was specifically degraded by rat liver’s CMA+ lysosomes and that endogenous TDP-43 is localized in rat brain’s CMA+ lysosomes, indicating that TDP-43 can be a CMA substrate in vivo. Next, by using a previously reported TDP-43 aggregation model, we have shown that wild-type and an aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 are detected in CMA+ lysosomes isolated from cell cultures. In addition, their protein levels increased in cells displaying CMA down-regulation, indicating that these two TDP-43 forms are CMA substrates in vitro. Finally, we observed that the aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 is able to interact with Hsc70, to co-localize with Lamp2A, and to up-regulate the levels of these molecular components of CMA. The latter was followed by an up-regulation of the CMA activity and lysosomal damage. Altogether our data shows that: (i) TDP-43 is a CMA substrate; (ii) CMA can contribute to control the turnover of physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43; and (iii) TDP-43 aggregation can affect CMA performance. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how a dysregulation between CMA and TDP-43 would participate in neuropathological mechanisms associated with TDP-43 aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The specific role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in emotional and behavioral regulation—particularly in relation to automatic processes—has gained increased attention in the sensory modulation literature. This mini-review article summarizes current knowledge about the role of the ANS in sensory modulation, with a focus on the integrated functions of the ANS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and their measurement. Research from the past decade illustrates that sympathetic and parasympathetic interactions are more complex than previously assumed. Patterns of ANS activation vary across individuals, with distinct physiological response profiles influencing the reactivity underlying automatic behavioral responses. This review article advances a deeper understanding of stress and the complex stress patterns within the ANS and HPA axis that contribute to allostatic load (AL). We argue that using multiple physiological measurements to capture individual ANS response variation is critical for effectively treating children with sensory modulation disorder (SMD) and sensory differences. We consider the relative contributions of automatic vs. deliberately controlled processes across large-scale neural networks in the development of sensorimotor function and their associated links with arousal patterns and sensory over- and under-responsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Tactile Virtual Reality for the Study of Active Somatosensation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00005</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00005</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants’ detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Limitations of Standard Accessible Captioning of Sounds and Music for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People: An EEG Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Captioning is the process of transcribing speech and acoustical information into text to help deaf and hard of hearing people accessing to the auditory track of audiovisual media. In addition to the verbal transcription, it includes information such as sound effects, speaker identification, or music tagging. However, it just takes into account a limited spectrum of the whole acoustic information available in the soundtrack, and hence, an important amount of emotional information is lost when attending just to the normative compliant captions. In this article, it is shown, by means of behavioral and EEG measurements, how emotional information related to sounds and music used by the creator in the audiovisual work is perceived differently by normal hearing group and hearing disabled group when applying standard captioning. Audio and captions activate similar processing areas, respectively, in each group, although not with the same intensity. Moreover, captions require higher activation of voluntary attentional circuits, as well as language-related areas. Captions transcribing musical information increase attentional activity, instead of emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure reportedly enhances allergic airway inflammation. However, some studies have shown an association between current cigarette smoke exposure and a low risk for allergic rhinitis. Thus, the impact of CS exposure on allergic rhinitis remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CS on the respiratory mucosa (RM) and the olfactory epithelium (OE) of mice with allergic rhinitis, as the effects may differ depending on the nasal histological compartments.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were used for this study. We developed a mouse model of smoking by intranasally administering 10 doses of a CS solution (CSS), and a mouse model of allergic rhinitis by sensitization with intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) injection and intranasal challenge with OVA. We examined the effects of CS on the nasal RM and OE in mice with or without allergic rhinitis using histological, serum, and genetic analyses. First, we examine whether CSS exposure induces allergic responses and then, examined allergic responses in the OVA-sensitized allergic rhinitis mice with or without CSS exposure.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Short-term CSS administration intensified allergic responses including increased infiltration of eosinophils and inflammatory cells and upregulation of interleukin-5 expression in the nasal RM of OVA-immunized mice, although only CSS induced neither allergic responses nor impairment of the RM and OE. Notably, repetitive OVA-immunization partially impaired the OE in the upper-lateral area, but CSS administration did not reinforce this impairment in OVA-induced allergic mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Short-term CSS exposure strengthened allergic responses in the nasal RM and did not change the structure of the OE. These results suggest that patients with allergic rhinitis could experience exacerbation of allergic symptoms after CS exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for “mental communication” on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for “yes” and to stay relaxed for “no.” The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as “yes” or “no” responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence links impairment of brain functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with disruptions of brain functional connectivity. However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation is of great importance in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). During the process of neuroinflammation, overactivated microglia release many proinflammatory factors, which eventually induce neurodegeneration. Inhibition of excessive microglial activation is regarded as a promising strategy for PD treatment. Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is closely related to tumors. Recently, some reports indicated that Src is a central mediator in multiple signaling pathways including neuroinflammation. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the role of Src in microglial regulation and neuroinflammation. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia model and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model were applied in this study. The results showed that inhibition of Src could significantly relieve microgliosis and decrease levels of inflammatory factors. Besides, inhibition of Src function reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons and improved the motor behavior of the MPTP-treated mice. Thus, this study not only verified the critical role of Src tyrosine kinase in neuroinflammation but also further proved that interfering neuroinflammation is beneficial for PD treatment. More importantly, this study shed a light on the hypothesis that Src tyrosine kinase might be a potential therapeutic target for PD and other neuroinflammation-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developments of new strategies to restore vision and improving on current strategies by harnessing new advancements in material and electrical sciences, and biological and genetic-based technologies are of upmost health priorities around the world. Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. This review also discusses major challenges in the field and offers bioengineering strategies to overcome those.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Difficulties and Problem-Solving Strategies in Wayfinding Among Adults With Cognitive Disabilities: A Look at the Bigger Picture</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many people with cognitive disabilities avoid outside activities, apparently for fear of getting lost. However, little is known about the nature of the difficulties encountered and the ways in which these individuals deal with them. None of the few studies on wayfinding by people with cognitive disabilities have explored the various specific difficulties they meet in everyday life. Using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology, this study aimed at profiling the types of difficulties encountered in urban mobility and the associated problem-solving strategies. In order to provide more direct evidence from the field, we conducted semi-structured interviews using the critical incident technique (Flanagan, 1954). Among the 66 participants interviewed, 44 had cognitive disabilities and 22 were matched controls. The analysis of the transcripts showed in particular an overall reduced autonomy in problem-solving strategies for people with a cognitive disability. The multiple correspondence analysis highlighted three main types of complex situations, covering a comprehensive range of complex situations that are met in everyday life by these individuals. Results also indicated that people with cognitive disabilities request assistance from another person more frequently when a complex event occurs. These situations are discussed as potential cues for improvements in navigational aids. Conclusions and perspectives are provided to improve wayfinding among people with cognitive disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Physics-Based Simulations to Predict the Differential Effects of Motor Control and Musculoskeletal Deficits on Gait Dysfunction in Cerebral Palsy: A Retrospective Case Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Physics-based simulations of walking have the theoretical potential to support clinical decision-making by predicting the functional outcome of treatments in terms of walking performance. Yet before using such simulations in clinical practice, their ability to identify the main treatment targets in specific patients needs to be demonstrated. In this study, we generated predictive simulations of walking with a medical imaging based neuro-musculoskeletal model of a child with cerebral palsy presenting crouch gait. We explored the influence of altered muscle-tendon properties, reduced neuromuscular control complexity, and spasticity on gait dysfunction in terms of joint kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, and metabolic cost of transport. We modeled altered muscle-tendon properties by personalizing Hill-type muscle-tendon parameters based on data collected during functional movements, simpler neuromuscular control by reducing the number of independent muscle synergies, and spasticity through delayed muscle activity feedback from muscle force and force rate. Our simulations revealed that, in the presence of aberrant musculoskeletal geometries, altered muscle-tendon properties rather than reduced neuromuscular control complexity and spasticity were the primary cause of the crouch gait pattern observed for this child, which is in agreement with the clinical examination. These results suggest that muscle-tendon properties should be the primary target of interventions aiming to restore an upright gait pattern for this child. This suggestion is in line with the gait analysis following muscle-tendon property and bone deformity corrections. Future work should extend this single case analysis to more patients in order to validate the ability of our physics-based simulations to capture the gait patterns of individual patients pre- and post-treatment. Such validation would open the door for identifying targeted treatment strategies with the aim of designing optimized interventions for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Multi-Target Motor Imagery Training Using Bimodal EEG-fMRI Neurofeedback: A Pilot Study in Chronic Stroke Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00037</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional rehabilitation techniques present limitations and the majority of patients show poor 1-year post-stroke recovery. Thus, Neurofeedback (NF) or Brain-Computer-Interface applications for stroke rehabilitation purposes are gaining increased attention. Indeed, NF has the potential to enhance volitional control of targeted cortical areas and thus impact on motor function recovery. However, current implementations are limited by temporal, spatial or practical constraints of the specific imaging modality used. In this pilot work and for the first time in literature, we applied bimodal EEG-fMRI NF for upper limb stroke recovery on four stroke-patients with different stroke characteristics and motor impairment severity. We also propose a novel, multi-target training approach that guides the training towards the activation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex. In addition to fMRI and EEG outcomes, we assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) with tractography. Preliminary results suggest the feasibility of our approach and show its potential to induce an augmented activation of ipsilesional motor areas, depending on the severity of the stroke deficit. Only the two patients with a preserved CST and subcortical lesions succeeded in upregulating the ipsilesional primary motor cortex and exhibited a functional improvement of upper limb motricity. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account the variability of the stroke patients’ population and enabled to identify inclusion criteria for the design of future clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Using the General Linear Model to Improve Performance in fNIRS Single Trial Analysis and Classification: A Perspective</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00030</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00030</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within a decade, single trial analysis of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals has gained significant momentum, and fNIRS joined the set of modalities frequently used for active and passive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). A great variety of methods for feature extraction and classification have been explored using state-of-the-art Machine Learning methods. In contrast, signal preprocessing and cleaning pipelines for fNIRS often follow simple recipes and so far rarely incorporate the available state-of-the-art in adjacent fields. In neuroscience, where fMRI and fNIRS are established neuroimaging tools, evoked hemodynamic brain activity is typically estimated across multiple trials using a General Linear Model (GLM). With the help of the GLM, subject, channel, and task specific evoked hemodynamic responses are estimated, and the evoked brain activity is more robustly separated from systemic physiological interference using independent measures of nuisance regressors, such as short-separation fNIRS measurements. When correctly applied in single trial analysis, e.g., in BCI, this approach can significantly enhance contrast to noise ratio of the brain signal, improve feature separability and ultimately lead to better classification accuracy. In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction into the GLM and show how to incorporate it into a typical BCI preprocessing pipeline and cross-validation. Using a resting state fNIRS data set augmented with synthetic hemodynamic responses that provide ground truth brain activity, we compare the quality of commonly used fNIRS features for BCI that are extracted from (1) conventionally preprocessed signals, and (2) signals preprocessed with the GLM and physiological nuisance regressors. We show that the GLM-based approach can provide better single trial estimates of brain activity as well as a new feature type, i.e., the weight of the individual and channel-specific hemodynamic response function (HRF) regressor. The improved estimates yield features with higher separability, that significantly enhance accuracy in a binary classification task when compared to conventional preprocessing—on average +7.4% across subjects and feature types. We propose to adapt this well-established approach from neuroscience to the domain of single-trial analysis and preprocessing wherever the classification of evoked brain activity is of concern, for instance in BCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Physical Activity Is Associated With Better Executive Function in University Students</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00011</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: In recent years, the study of the benefits that physical exercise has on brain health has acquired special relevance. In order to implement exercise as an intervention to protect the brain, it is important to have a more clear idea of its effect in the young population. However, few studies have been carried out on these ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The main objective of our study was to evaluate the association between physical activity (PA) with memory and executive function, in university students, analyzing the modulatory effect of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology: We collected socio-demographic and life habit information, as well as data on the PA that was carried out during the previous week using the international PAquestionnaire short version (IPAQ-SF) questionnaire in 206 university students (mean age 19.55 ± 2.39; 67.5% women). Memory and executive function were assessed using a comprehensive battery of validate cognitive tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate PA with cognitive tests scores and to evaluate the potential synergistic role of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main finding was that the total amount of PA correlated positively with several tests that evaluated aspects of executive function, specifically Stroop Colors (Pearson’s r = 0.17; p = 0.01) and the Stroop Test Color–Word (Pearson’s r = 0.15. p = 0.03). These results were adjusted by a large number of possible confounders and modifying variables in a multivariate analysis, like age, sex, academic record, day of the week, and time at which the test was performed. Additionally, we found out that sex had a synergistic effect with PA on the executive test Trail making test-A (TMTA), and in women, this association was stronger than in men. The more PA women reported, the better they performed, that is to say that they took less time to finalize the TMT-A (interaction term between PA and sex: b = −0.0009; p = 0.014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study adds evidence of the benefit of PA in cognition in the young population, specifically in the executive inhibitory control, and more significantly in women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Adaptive Tuning Curve Widths Improve Sample Efficient Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Natural brains perform miraculously well in learning new tasks from a small number of samples, whereas sample efficient learning is still a major open problem in the field of machine learning. Here, we raise the question, how the neural coding scheme affects sample efficiency, and make first progress on this question by proposing and analyzing a learning algorithm that uses a simple reinforce-type plasticity mechanism and does not require any gradients to learn low dimensional mappings. It harnesses three bio-plausible mechanisms, namely, population codes with bell shaped tuning curves, continous attractor mechanisms and probabilistic synapses, to achieve sample efficient learning. We show both theoretically and by simulations that population codes with broadly tuned neurons lead to high sample efficiency, whereas codes with sharply tuned neurons account for high final precision. Moreover, a dynamic adaptation of the tuning width during learning gives rise to both, high sample efficiency and high final precision. We prove a sample efficiency guarantee for our algorithm that lies within a logarithmic factor from the information theoretical optimum. Our simulations show that for low dimensional mappings, our learning algorithm achieves comparable sample efficiency to multi-layer perceptrons trained by gradient descent, although it does not use any gradients. Furthermore, it achieves competitive sample efficiency in low dimensional reinforcement learning tasks. From a machine learning perspective, these findings may inspire novel approaches to improve sample efficiency. From a neuroscience perspective, these findings suggest sample efficiency as a yet unstudied functional role of adaptive tuning curve width.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Resonance in the Mouse Ventral Tegmental Area Dopaminergic Network Induced by Regular and Poisson Distributed Optogenetic Stimulation in-vitro</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in many brain regions exhibit spontaneous, intrinsic rhythmic firing activity. This rhythmic firing activity may determine the way in which these neurons respond to extrinsic synaptic inputs. We hypothesized that neurons should be most responsive to inputs at the frequency of the intrinsic oscillation frequency. We addressed this question in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic nucleus in the midbrain. VTA neurons have a unique propensity to exhibit spontaneous intrinsic rhythmic activity in the 1–5 Hz frequency range, which persists in the in-vitro brain slice, and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators. Here, we combine in-vitro simultaneous recording of action potentials from a 60 channel multi-electrode-array with cell-type-specific optogenetic stimulation of the VTA dopamine neurons. We investigated how VTA neurons respond to wide-band stochastic (Poisson input) as well as regular laser pulses. Strong synchrony was induced between the laser input and the spike timing of the neurons, both for regular pulse trains and Poisson pulse trains. For rhythmically pulsed input, the neurons demonstrated resonant behavior with the strongest phase locking at their intrinsic oscillation frequency, but also at half and double the intrinsic oscillation frequency. Stochastic Poisson pulse stimulation provided a more effective stimulation of the entire population, yet we observed resonance at lower frequencies (approximately half the oscillation frequency) than the neurons' intrinsic oscillation frequency. The non-linear filter characteristics of dopamine neurons could allow the VTA to predict precisely timed future rewards based on past sensory inputs, a crucial component of reward prediction error signaling. In addition, these filter characteristics could contribute to a pacemaker role for the VTA in synchronizing activity with other regions like the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Approach for Fully Automatic Intra-Tumor Segmentation With 3D U-Net Architecture for Gliomas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00010</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00010</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and prognosis. Understanding of tumor biology and intra-tumor heterogeneity is necessary for planning personalized therapy and predicting response to therapy. Accurate tumoral and intra-tumoral segmentation on MRI is the first step toward understanding the tumor biology through computational methods. The purpose of this study was to design a segmentation algorithm and evaluate its performance on pre-treatment brain MRIs obtained from patients with gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: In this study, we have designed a novel 3D U-Net architecture that segments various radiologically identifiable sub-regions like edema, enhancing tumor, and necrosis. Weighted patch extraction scheme from the tumor border regions is proposed to address the problem of class imbalance between tumor and non-tumorous patches. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and the symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is trained on 285 patients, validated on 66 patients and tested on 191 patients with Glioma from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset. Three dimensional patches are extracted from multi-channel BraTS training dataset to train 3D U-Net architecture. The efficacy of the proposed approach is also tested on an independent dataset of 40 patients with High Grade Glioma from our tertiary cancer center. Segmentation results are assessed in terms of Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Hausdorff 95 distance (ITCN intra-tumoral classification network).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Our proposed architecture achieved Dice scores of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.75 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively, on BraTS validation dataset and 0.85, 0.77, 0.67 on test dataset. The results were similar on the independent patients' dataset from our hospital, achieving Dice scores of 0.92, 0.90, and 0.81 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results of this study show the potential of patch-based 3D U-Net for the accurate intra-tumor segmentation. From experiments, it is observed that the weighted patch-based segmentation approach gives comparable performance with the pixel-based approach when there is a thin boundary between tumor subparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Intentional Switching Between Bimanual Coordination Patterns in Older Adults: Is It Mediated by Inhibition Processes?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00029</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00029</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study investigated the consequences of age-related decline in inhibition processes on intentional switching between bimanual coordination patterns. Fifteen young (24±2.8 years) and 20 older adults (69±5.3 years) performed Stroop tasks and bimanual coordination tasks. Stroop tasks included neutral, congruent, and incongruent conditions. Response time and error rate were measured. Bimanual coordination tasks consisted of performing in-phase (IP) and anti-phase (AP) patterns. Participants were requested to switch as quickly as possible from one pattern to the other, resulting in two different switching directions (AP to IP; IP to AP). Mean and standard deviation (SD) of the continuous relative phase (CRP) were calculated pre- and post-switching for each participant. Total switching time (TST) was measured. The switching phase was also decomposed into reaction time (RT) and reversal time (REvT). Pearson correlation analyses were performed to test for correlations between: (i) SD of CRP and response time in Stroop tasks, and (ii) switching times (TST, RT, RevT) and response time in Stroop task, respectively. In addition, parallel mediation analyses were conducted. Results showed that: (i) the AP pattern was less stable than the IP pattern in both young and older adults, (ii) coordination patterns were less stable in older adults, (iii) response times in Stroop task were longer in the incongruent condition, and (iv) RespTs were longer in older than in young participants, whatever the condition. In the bimanual coordination task, RT, RevT, and TST increased with age. The stability of the IP pattern was correlated with the response times observed in neutral and congruent conditions, while the stability of the AP pattern was correlated with response time observed in the incongruent condition. Correlation and mediation analyses showed that, in the AP to IP switching direction, RT and RevT were both significantly correlated with response times observed in the incongruent condition of Stroop task. These findings suggest that inhibition processes are involved in switching between bimanual coordination patterns, at least to trigger the early phase of switching. They also support the hypothesis that inhibition processes are more involved in maintaining the AP pattern and switching to the IP pattern. Finally, age-related changes in switching times seem to be prominently mediated by alterations of inhibition processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Genetic analysis of the Arabidopsis TIR1/AFB auxin receptors reveals both overlapping and specialized functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54740</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54740</link>
	<description>The TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptors mediate diverse responses to the plant hormone auxin. The Arabidopsis genome encodes six TIR1/AFB proteins representing three of the four clades that were established prior to angiosperm radiation. To determine the role of these proteins in plant development we performed an extensive genetic analysis involving the generation and characterization of all possible multiply-mutant lines. We find that loss of all six TIR1/AFB proteins results in early embryo defects and eventually seed abortion, and yet a single wild-type allele of &lt;i&gt;TIR1 &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;AFB2&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to support growth throughout development. Our analysis reveals extensive functional overlap between even the most distantly related &lt;i&gt;TIR1/AFB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;genes except for &lt;i&gt;AFB1&lt;/i&gt;. Surprisingly, &lt;i&gt;AFB1&lt;/i&gt; has a specialized function in rapid auxin-dependent inhibition of root growth and early phase of root gravitropism. This activity may be related to a difference in subcellular localization compared to the other members of the family.</description>

	<description>The origin of ‘orphan’ genes, species-specific sequences that lack detectable homologues, has remained mysterious since the dawn of the genomic era. There are two dominant explanations for orphan genes: complete sequence divergence from ancestral genes, such that homologues are not readily detectable; and de novo emergence from ancestral non-genic sequences, such that homologues genuinely do not exist. The relative contribution of the two processes remains unknown. Here, we harness the special circumstance of conserved synteny to estimate the contribution of complete divergence to the pool of orphan genes. By separately comparing yeast, fly and human genes to related taxa using conservative criteria, we find that complete divergence accounts, on average, for at most a third of eukaryotic orphan and taxonomically restricted genes. We observe that complete divergence occurs at a stable rate within a phylum but at different rates between phyla, and is frequently associated with gene shortening akin to pseudogenization.</description>

	<description>Humans form social coalitions in every society, yet we know little about how we learn and represent social group boundaries. Here we derive predictions from a computational model of latent structure learning to move beyond explicit category labels and interpersonal, or dyadic similarity as the sole inputs to social group representations. Using a model-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data, we find that separate areas correlate with dyadic similarity and latent structure learning. Trial-by-trial estimates of 'allyship' based on dyadic similarity between participants and each agent recruited medial prefrontal cortex/pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC). Latent social group structure-based allyship estimates, in contrast, recruited right anterior insula (rAI). Variability in the brain signal from rAI improved prediction of variability in ally-choice behavior, whereas variability from the pgACC did not. These results provide novel insights into the psychological and neural mechanisms by which people learn to distinguish 'us' from 'them'.</description>

	<description>Experience alters brain structure, but the underlying mechanism remained unknown. Structural plasticity reveals that brain function is encoded in generative changes to cells that compete with destructive processes driving neurodegeneration. At an adult critical period, experience increases fiber number and brain size in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we asked if Toll receptors are involved. Tolls demarcate a map of brain anatomical domains. Focusing on &lt;i&gt;Toll-2,&lt;/i&gt; loss of function caused apoptosis, neurite atrophy and impaired behaviour. Toll-2 gain of function and neuronal activity at the critical period increased cell number. Toll-2 induced cycling of adult progenitor cells via a novel pathway, that antagonized MyD88-dependent quiescence, and engaged Weckle and Yorkie downstream. Constant knock-down of multiple &lt;i&gt;Tolls &lt;/i&gt;synergistically reduced brain size. Conditional over-expression of &lt;i&gt;Toll-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;wek&lt;/i&gt; at the adult critical period increased brain size. Through their topographic distribution, Toll receptors regulate neuronal number and brain size, modulating structural plasticity in the adult brain.</description>

	<description>In malaria, rosetting is described as a phenomenon where an infected erythrocyte (IRBC) is attached to uninfected erythrocytes (URBC). In some studies, rosetting has been associated with malaria pathogenesis. Here, we have identified a new type of rosetting. Using a step-by-step approach, we identified IGFBP7, a protein secreted by monocytes in response to parasite stimulation, as a rosette-stimulator for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt;-IRBC. IGFBP7-mediated rosette-stimulation was rapid yet reversible. Unlike type I rosetting that involves direct interaction of rosetting ligands on IRBC and receptors on URBC, The IGFBP7-mediated, type II rosetting requires two additional serum factors, namely Von Willebrand Factor and Thrombospondin-1. These two factors interact with IGFBP7 to mediate rosette formation by the IRBC. Importantly, the IGFBP7-induced type II rosetting hampers phagocytosis of IRBC by host phagocytes.</description>

	<description>Catechol dehydroxylation is a central chemical transformation in the gut microbial metabolism of plant- and host-derived small molecules. However, the molecular basis for this transformation and its distribution among gut microorganisms are poorly understood. Here, we characterize a molybdenum-dependent enzyme from the human gut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Eggerthella lenta&lt;/i&gt; that dehydroxylates catecholamine neurotransmitters. Our findings suggest that this activity enables &lt;i&gt;E. lenta&lt;/i&gt; to use dopamine as an electron acceptor. We also identify candidate dehydroxylases that metabolize additional host- and plant-derived catechols. These dehydroxylases belong to a distinct group of largely uncharacterized molybdenum-dependent enzymes that likely mediate primary and secondary metabolism in multiple environments. Finally, we observe catechol dehydroxylation in the gut microbiotas of diverse mammals, confirming the presence of this chemistry in habitats beyond the human gut. These results suggest that the chemical strategies that mediate metabolism and interactions in the human gut are relevant to a broad range of species and habitats.</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) process multiple aspects of a tasting experience, encoding not only the physiochemical identity of tastes, but also their anticipation and hedonic value. Information pertaining to these stimulus features is relayed to GC via the gustatory thalamus (VPMpc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). It is not known whether these inputs drive separate groups of neurons, thus activating separate channels of information, or are integrated by neurons that receive both afferents. Here, we used anterograde labeling and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats to assess the potential convergence of BLA and VPMpc inputs in GC, and to investigate the dynamics of integration of these inputs. We report substantial anatomic overlap of BLA and VPMpc axonal fields across GC, and identify a population of GC neurons receiving converging BLA and VPMpc inputs. Our data show that BLA modulates the gain of VPMpc-evoked responses in a time-dependent fashion and that this modulation is dependent on the recruitment of synaptic inhibition by both BLA and VPMpc. Our results suggest that BLA shapes cortical processing of thalamic inputs by dynamically gating the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the GC circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cross-Modal Integration of Reward Value during Oculomotor Planning</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reward value guides goal-directed behavior and modulates early sensory processing. Rewarding stimuli are often multisensory, but it is not known how reward value is combined across sensory modalities. Here we show that the integration of reward value critically depends on whether the distinct sensory inputs are perceived to emanate from the same multisensory object. We systematically manipulated the congruency in monetary reward values and the relative spatial positions of co-occurring auditory and visual stimuli that served as bimodal distractors during an oculomotor task performed by healthy human participants (male and female). The amount of interference induced by the distractors was used as an indicator of their perceptual salience. Our results across two experiments show that when reward value is linked to each modality separately, the value congruence between vision and audition determines the combined salience of the bimodal distractors. However, the reward value of vision wins over the value of audition if the two modalities are perceived to convey conflicting information regarding the spatial position of the bimodal distractors. These results show that in a task that highly relies on the processing of visual spatial information, the reward values from multiple sensory modalities are integrated with each other, each with their respective weights. This weighting depends on the strength of prior beliefs regarding a common source for incoming unisensory signals based on their congruency in reward value and perceived spatial alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The Epileptor model: a systematic mathematical analysis linked to the dynamics of seizures, refractory status epilepticus and depolarization block</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;One characteristic of epilepsy is the variety of mechanisms leading to the epileptic state, which are still largely unknown. Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and depolarization block (DB) are other pathological brain activities linked to epilepsy, whose patterns are different, and whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. In epileptogenic network modeling, the Epileptor is a generic phenomenological model that has been recently developed to describe the dynamics of seizures. Here, we performed a detailed qualitative analysis of the Epileptor model based on dynamical systems theory and bifurcation analysis, and investigate the dynamic evolution of&quot; normal&quot; activity toward seizures and to the pathological RSE and DB states. The mechanisms of the transition between states are called bifurcations. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that the generic model undergoes different bifurcation types at seizure offset, when varying some selected parameters. We show that the pathological and normal activities can co-exist within the same model under some conditions, and demonstrate that there are many pathways leading to and away from these activities. We here archive systematically all behaviors and dynamic regimes of the Epileptor model, to serve as a resource in the development of patient specific brain network models, and more generally in epilepsy research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is characterized by patient specific electrophysiological discharges. The range of mechanisms and pathways leading to the same type of seizure, however, is large. The Epileptor model has found many applications in epilepsy research and clinical applications, because it allows the classification and dynamic modeling of seizure types independent of the knowledge of its underlying biophysical mechanisms. It is based purely on the dynamic features of the seizure. We provide here a complete functional atlas of all possible behaviors of the Epileptor model, which serves as a useful ressource in modeling brain networks in epilepsy. More, we explore the contribution of the Epileptor model to better understand the dynamics of the RSE and DB phenomena which are linked to epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Binaural beats through the auditory pathway: from brainstem to connectivity patterns</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Binaural beating is a perceptual auditory illusion occurring when presenting two neighboring frequencies to each ear separately. Several controversial claims have been attributed to binaural beats regarding their ability to entrain human brain activity and mood, in both the scientific literature and the marketing realm. Here, we sought to address those questions in a robust fashion using a single-blind, active-controlled protocol. To do so, we compared the effects of binaural beats with a control beat stimulation (monaural beats, known to entrain brain activity but not mood) across four distinct levels in the human auditory pathway: subcortical and cortical entrainment, scalp-level Functional Connectivity and self-reports. Both stimuli elicited standard subcortical responses at the pure tone frequencies of the stimulus (i.e., Frequency Following Response), and entrained the cortex at the beat frequency (i.e., Auditory Steady State Response). Furthermore, Functional Connectivity patterns were modulated differentially by both kinds of stimuli, with binaural beats being the only one eliciting cross-frequency activity. Despite this, we did not find any mood modulation related to our experimental manipulation. Our results provide evidence that binaural beats elicit cross frequency connectivity patterns, but weakly entrain the cortex when compared to monaural beat stimuli. Whether binaural beats have an impact on cognitive performance or other mood measurements remains to be seen and can be further investigated within the proposed methodological framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Binaural beats have been a source of speculation and debate in the scientific community. Our study addresses controversial claims and approaches them using proper experimental control and modern signal processing techniques. Here we show that binaural beats can both entrain the cortex and elicit specific connectivity patterns. Regardless of this, our monaural control condition was able to entrain the cortex more strongly, and both binaural beats and the control condition failed to regulate mood. All in all, though binaural beats entrain cortical activity and elicit complex patterns of connectivity, the functional significance (if any) of binaural beats, and whether they are more &quot;special&quot; than monaural beats remain open questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While probabilistic models describe the dependence structure between observed
variables, causal models go one step further: they predict how cognitive
functions are affected by external interventions that perturb neuronal
activity. Inferring causal relationships from data is an ambitious task that is
particularly challenging in cognitive neuroscience. Here, we discuss two
difficulties in more detail: the scarcity of interventional data and the
challenge of finding the right variables. We argue for distributional
robustness as a guiding principle to tackle these problems. Modelling a target
variable using the correct set of causal variables yields a model that
generalises across environments or subjects (if these environments leave the
causal mechanisms intact). Conversely, if a candidate model does not
generalise, then either it includes non-causes of the target variable or the
underlying variables are wrongly defined. In this sense, generalisability may
serve as a guiding principle when defining relevant variables and can be used
to partially compensate for the lack of interventional data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: What is the function of inter-hemispheric inhibition?. (arXiv:2002.05774v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05774</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05774</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely supposed that following unilateral brain injury, there arises an
asymmetry in inter-hemispheric inhibition which has an adverse influence upon
motor control. I argue that this 'inter-hemispheric imbalance' model arises
from a fundamental misunderstanding of the roles played by inter-hemispheric
(callosal) projections in mammalian brains. Drawing upon a large body of
empirical data, derived largely from animal models, and associated theoretical
modeling, it is demonstrated that inter-hemispheric projections perform
contrast enhancing and integrative functions via mechanisms such as
surround/lateral inhibition. The principal functional unit of callosal
influence comprises a facilitatory centre and a depressing peripheral zone,
that together shape the influence of converging inputs to pyramidal neurons.
Inter-hemispheric inhibition is an instance of a more general feature of
mammalian neural systems, whereby inhibitory interneurons act not simply to
prevent over-excitation but to sculpt the output of specific circuits. The
narrowing of the excitatory focus that occurs through crossed surround
inhibition is a highly conserved motif of transcallosal interactions in
mammalian sensory and motor cortices. A case is presented that the notion of
'inter-hemispheric imbalance' has been sustained, and clinical interventions
derived from this model promoted, by erroneous assumptions concerning that
revealed by investigative techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). The alternative perspective promoted by the present analysis, also
permits the basis of positive (e.g. post stroke) associations between the
structural integrity of transcallosal projections and motor capability to be
better understood.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How spatial frequencies and color drive object search in real-world scenes: A new eye-movement corpus. (arXiv:1910.09904v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09904</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09904</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When studying how people search for objects in scenes, the inhomogeneity of
the visual field is often ignored. Due to physiological limitations peripheral
vision is blurred and mainly uses coarse-grained information (i.e., low spatial
frequencies) for selecting saccade targets, whereas high-acuity central vision
uses fine-grained information (i.e., high spatial frequencies) for analysis of
details. Here we investigated how spatial frequencies and color affect object
search in real-world scenes. Using gaze-contingent filters we attenuated high
or low frequencies in central or peripheral vision while viewers searched color
or grayscale scenes. Results showed that peripheral filters and central
high-pass filters hardly affected search accuracy, whereas accuracy dropped
drastically with central low-pass filters. Peripheral filtering increased the
time to localize the target by decreasing saccade amplitudes and increasing
number and duration of fixations. The use of coarse-grained information in the
periphery was limited to color scenes. Central filtering increased the time to
verify target identity instead, especially with low-pass filters. We conclude
that peripheral vision is critical for object localization and central vision
is critical for object identification. Visual guidance during peripheral object
localization is dominated by low-frequency color information, whereas
high-frequency information, relatively independent of color, is most important
for object identification in central vision.

	<description>Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motifs are thought to play an important role in translational initiation in bacteria. Paradoxically, ribosome profiling studies in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; show no correlation between the strength of an mRNA's SD motif and how efficiently it is translated. Performing profiling on ribosomes with altered anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences, we reveal a genome-wide correlation between SD strength and ribosome occupancy that was previously masked by other contributing factors. Using the antibiotic retapamulin to trap initiation complexes at start codons, we find that the mutant ribosomes select start sites correctly, arguing that start sites are hard-wired for initiation through the action of other mRNA features. We show that A-rich sequences upstream of start codons promote initiation. Taken together, our genome-wide study reveals that SD motifs are not necessary for ribosomes to determine where initiation occurs, though they do affect how efficiently initiation occurs.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A single-parasite transcriptional atlas of Toxoplasma gondii reveals novel control of antigen expression</title>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt;, a protozoan parasite, undergoes a complex and poorly understood developmental process that is critical for establishing a chronic infection in its intermediate hosts. Here, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on &amp;gt;5,400 Toxoplasma in both tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages using three widely studied strains to construct a comprehensive atlas of cell-cycle and asexual development, revealing hidden states and transcriptional factors associated with each developmental stage. Analysis of SAG1-related sequence (SRS) antigenic repertoire reveals a highly heterogeneous, sporadic expression pattern unexplained by measurement noise, cell cycle, or asexual development. Furthermore, we identified AP2IX-1 as a transcription factor that controls the switching from the ubiquitous SAG1 to rare surface antigens not previously observed in tachyzoites. In addition, comparative analysis between &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; scRNA-seq results reveals concerted expression of gene sets, despite fundamental differences in cell division. Lastly, we built an interactive data-browser for visualization of our atlas resource.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of BICD2 variants in spinal muscular atrophy</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bicaudal D cargo adaptor 2 (BICD2) gene encodes a conserved cargo adapter protein required for dynein‐mediated transport. Inherited and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; cause spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity dominant 2 (SMALED2), and a subset have recently been reported to cause severe, often lethal disease. However, a true genotype‐phenotype correlation for &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; has not been performed, and cases described to date are scattered among at least 14 publications. In this review, we identify the characteristics of disease‐causing variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; that distinguish them from benign variation, and perform genotype‐phenotype correlations for 99 &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; variant carriers from 35 families.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national healthcare and census registers. We included 4187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1620 of fingolimod, and 1670 of natalizumab, in 6136 MS patients, age‐sex‐and‐location matched to 37801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate, IR, per 10,000 person years 34.4 [95% confidence interval 23.7–48.3]), fingolimod 28 (44.0 [29.2–63.5]), and natalizumab 17 (26.0 [15.1–41.6]). The general population IR was 31.0 [27.8–34.4]. Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population, but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (1.53 [0.98–2.38]) and rituximab (hazard ratio 1.68 [1.00–2.84]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first, large, comparative study of three highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer and further studies are warranted to validate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Validation of rapid magnetic resonance myelin imaging in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25705?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex post‐processing or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐relaxometry and proton density mapping, in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3 Tesla MRI; &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; in three multiple sclerosis brain samples and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan‐rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein‐immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Since the technique is fast with automatic post‐processing and FDA/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;

Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is well recognized to be variable across independent replications of genome-wide transcriptional studies. These are often employed to characterize disease state early in the process of discovery and prioritize novel targets aimed at addressing unmet medical need. Increasing reproducibility of biological findings from these studies could potentially positively impact the success rate of new clinical interventions. This work demonstrates that statistically sound combination of gene expression data with prior knowledge about biology in the form of large protein interaction networks can yield quantitatively more reproducible observations from studies characterizing human disease. The novel concept of Well-Associated Proteins (WAPs) introduced herein—gene products significantly associated on protein interaction networks with the differences in transcript levels between control and disease—does not require choosing a differential expression threshold and can be computed efficiently enough to enable false discovery rate estimation via permutation. Reproducibility of WAPs is shown to be on average superior to that of DEGs under easily-quantifiable conditions suggesting that they can yield a significantly more robust description of disease. Enhanced reproducibility of WAPs versus DEGs is first demonstrated with four independent data sets focused on systemic sclerosis. This finding is then validated over thousands of pairs of data sets obtained by random partitions of large studies in several other diseases. Conditions that individual data sets must satisfy to yield robust WAP scores are examined. Reproducible identification of WAPs can potentially benefit drug target selection and precision medicine studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XlPL1cTbnic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: RAINBOW: Haplotype-based genome-wide association study using a novel SNP-set method</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kosuke Hamazaki, Hiroyoshi Iwata&lt;/p&gt;

Difficulty in detecting rare variants is one of the problems in conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The problem is closely related to the complex gene compositions comprising multiple alleles, such as haplotypes. Several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. These methods, however, have been rarely discussed in connection with haplotypes. In this study, we developed a novel SNP-set method named “RAINBOW” and applied the method to haplotype-based GWAS by regarding a haplotype block as a SNP-set. Combining haplotype block estimation and SNP-set GWAS, haplotype-based GWAS can be conducted without prior information of haplotypes. We prepared 100 datasets of simulated phenotypic data and real marker genotype data of &lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt;, and performed GWAS of the datasets. We compared the power of our method, the conventional single-SNP GWAS, the conventional haplotype-based GWAS, and the conventional SNP-set GWAS. Our proposed method was shown to be superior to these in three aspects: (1) controlling false positives; (2) in detecting causal variants without relying on the linkage disequilibrium if causal variants were genotyped in the dataset; and (3) it showed greater power than the other methods, i.e., it was able to detect causal variants that were not detected by the others, primarily when the causal variants were located very close to each other, and the directions of their effects were opposite. By using the SNP-set approach as in this study, we expect that detecting not only rare variants but also genes with complex mechanisms, such as genes with multiple causal variants, can be realized. RAINBOW was implemented as an R package named “RAINBOWR” and is available from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RAINBOWR/index.html) and GitHub (https://github.com/KosukeHamazaki/RAINBOWR).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mp67jO5-51A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a multi-disciplinary image-based blood flow perfusion modeling of a whole organ vascular network for analyzing both its structural and functional properties. We show how the use of Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) permits whole-organ micro-vascular imaging, analysis and modelling. By using adapted image post-treatment workflow, we could segment, vectorize and reconstruct the entire micro-vascular network composed of 1.7 million vessels, from the tissue-scale, inside a ∼ 25 × 5 × 1 = 125mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; volume of the mouse fat pad, hundreds of times larger than previous studies, down to the cellular scale at micron resolution, with the entire blood perfusion modeled. Adapted network analysis revealed the structural and functional organization of meso-scale tissue as strongly connected communities of vessels. These communities share a distinct heterogeneous core region and a more homogeneous peripheral region, consistently with known biological functions of fat tissue. Graph clustering analysis also revealed two distinct robust meso-scale typical sizes (from 10 to several hundred times the cellular size), revealing, for the first time, strongly connected functional vascular communities. These community networks support heterogeneous micro-environments. This work provides the proof of concept that in-silico all-tissue perfusion modeling can reveal new structural and functional exchanges between micro-regions in tissues, found from community clusters in the vascular graph.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wTJXpX9y1o8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Transcription elongation can be modelled as a three step process, involving polymerase translocation, NTP binding, and nucleotide incorporation into the nascent mRNA. This cycle of events can be simulated at the single-molecule level as a continuous-time Markov process using parameters derived from single-molecule experiments. Previously developed models differ in the way they are parameterised, and in their incorporation of partial equilibrium approximations. We have formulated a hierarchical network comprised of 12 sequence-dependent transcription elongation models. The simplest model has two parameters and assumes that both translocation and NTP binding can be modelled as equilibrium processes. The most complex model has six parameters makes no partial equilibrium assumptions. We systematically compared the ability of these models to explain published force-velocity data, using approximate Bayesian computation. This analysis was performed using data for the RNA polymerase complexes of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and Bacteriophage T7. Our analysis indicates that the polymerases differ significantly in their translocation rates, with the rates in T7 pol being fast compared to &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; RNAP and &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; pol II. Different models are applicable in different cases. We also show that all three RNA polymerases have an energetic preference for the posttranslocated state over the pretranslocated state. A Bayesian inference and model selection framework, like the one presented in this publication, should be routinely applicable to the interrogation of single-molecule datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2tHd_00Xzgw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The olfactory bulb is the obligatory input station for olfactory information. In contrast to the traditional view as a static relay station, recent evidence indicates that the olfactory bulb dynamically processes olfactory information in an experience-dependent and context-dependent manner. Here, we review recent studies on experience-dependent plasticity of the main circuit components within the olfactory bulb of rodents. We argue that the olfactory bulb plasticity allows optimal representations of behaviorally-relevant odors in the continuously changing olfactory environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Does Birth Trigger Cell Death in the Developing Brain?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0517-19.2020?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental cell death eliminates half of the neurons initially generated in the mammalian brain, and occurs perinatally in many species. It is possible that the timing of neuronal cell death is developmentally programmed, and only coincidentally associated with birth. Alternatively, birth may play a role in shaping cell death. To test these competing hypotheses, we experimentally advanced or delayed birth by 1 d in mice (within the normal range of gestation for the species) and examined effects on the temporal pattern and magnitude (amount) of neuronal cell death, using immunohistochemical detection of activated caspase-3 as a cell death marker. In order to detect effects of subtle changes in birth timing, we focused on brain areas that exhibit sharp postnatal peaks in cell death. We find that advancing birth advances peak cell death, supporting the hypothesis that birth triggers cell death. However, a delay of birth does not delay cell death. Thus, birth can advance cell death, but if postponed, a developmental program governs. Advancing or delaying birth also caused region-specific changes in the overall magnitude of cell death. Our findings shed light on the long-standing question of what controls the timing and magnitude of developmental neuronal cell death, and position birth as an orchestrator of brain development. Because humans across the world now routinely alter birth timing, these findings may have implications for current obstetric practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Evaluations of the biological effects of space radiation must carefully consider the biological system response and the specific nature of the source term. Acharya et al. (2019) review neurocognitive function during deep space exposures to chronic, low dose rate, neutron radiation, but do not use a source term that reflects the actual space environment in terms of radiation types and their respective energies. In addition, important biological effects, including the adaptive response to the space radiation environment, are not addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Within neuroscience, models have many roles, including driving hypotheses, making assumptions explicit, synthesizing knowledge, making experimental predictions, and facilitating applications to medicine. While specific modeling techniques are often taught, the process of constructing models for a given phenomenon or question is generally left opaque. Here, informed by guiding many students through modeling exercises at our summer school in CoSMo (Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience), we provide a practical 10-step breakdown of the modeling process. This approach makes choices and criteria more explicit and replicable. Experiment design has long been taught in neuroscience; the modeling process should receive the same attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The Neural Dynamics of Individual Differences in Episodic Autobiographical Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0531-19.2020v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The ability to mentally travel to specific events from one’s past, dubbed episodic autobiographical memory (E-AM), contributes to adaptive functioning. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its typical interindividual variation remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we capitalize on existing evidence that successful performance on E-AM tasks draws on the ability to visualize past episodes and reinstate their unique spatiotemporal context. Hence, here, we test whether features of the brain’s functional architecture relevant to perceptual versus conceptual processes shape individual differences in both self-rated E-AM and laboratory-based episodic memory for random visual scene sequences (visual EM). We propose that superior subjective E-AM and visual EM are associated with greater similarity in static neural organization patterns, potentially indicating greater efficiency in switching, between rest and mental states relevant to encoding perceptual information. Complementarily, we postulate that impoverished subjective E-AM and visual EM are linked to dynamic brain organization patterns implying a predisposition towards semanticizing novel perceptual information. Analyses were conducted on resting state and task-based fMRI data from 329 participants (160 women) in the Human Connectome Project who completed visual and verbal EM assessments, and an independent gender diverse sample (N = 59) who self-rated their E-AM. Interindividual differences in subjective E-AM were linked to the same neural mechanisms underlying visual, but not verbal, EM, in general agreement with the hypothesized static and dynamic brain organization patterns. Our results suggest that higher E-AM entails more efficient processing of temporally extended information sequences, whereas lower E-AM entails more efficient semantic or gist-based processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ability to revisit specific events from one’s past is key to identity formation and optimal interpersonal functioning. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its typical interindividual variation are yet to be fully characterized. Here, we provide novel evidence that, among younger adults, dispositional variations in subjective mental time travel draw on the same dynamic and static features of the brain’s architecture that are uniquely implicated in memory for spatiotemporal contexts. Specifically, the subjective sense of being able to revisit one’s past relates to neural mechanisms supporting serial mental operations, whereas difficulties in accessing past experiences may be traced back to a predisposition towards gist-based processing of incoming information&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Mapping of sensory nerve subsets within the vagal ganglia and the brainstem using reporter mice for Pirt, TRPV1, 5HT3 and Tac1 expression</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Vagal afferent sensory nerves, originating in jugular and nodose ganglia, are comprised of functionally distinct subsets whose activation evokes distinct thoracic and abdominal reflex responses. We used Cre-expressing mouse strains to identify specific vagal afferent populations and map their central projections within the brainstem. We show that Pirt is expressed in virtually all vagal afferents; whereas 5HT3 is expressed only in nodose neurons, with little expression in jugular neurons. TRPV1, the capsaicin receptor, is expressed in a subset of small nodose and jugular neurons. Tac1, the gene for tachykinins, is expressed predominantly in jugular neurons, some of which also express TRPV1. Vagal fibers project centrally to the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), paratrigeminal complex, area postrema and to a limited extent the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. nTS subnuclei preferentially receive projections by specific afferent subsets, with TRPV1+ fibers terminating in medial and dorsal regions predominantly caudal of obex, whereas TRPV1-negative fibers terminate in ventral and lateral regions throughout the rostral-caudal aspect of the medulla. Many vagal Tac1+ afferents (mostly derived from the jugular ganglion) terminate in the nTS. The paratrigeminal complex was the target of multiple vagal afferent subsets. Importantly, lung-specific TRPV1+ and Tac1+ afferent terminations were restricted to the caudal medial nTS, with no innervation of other medulla regions. In summary, this study identifies the specific medulla regions innervated by vagal afferent subsets. The distinct terminations provide a neuroanatomic substrate for the diverse range of reflexes initiated by vagal afferent activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Vagal afferents transmit sensory information from visceral organs to the brainstem, where their activity alters sensation and visceral reflexes. Vagal afferents are comprised of distinct subsets which serve distinct functions. Little is known of the neuroanatomy of central projections of distinct vagal subsets, thus there remains an incomplete understanding of how visceral events evoke appropriate behavioral and reflex responses. This precludes rationally-developed pharmacological or electroceutical interventions to modify aberrant sensations/reflexes. Here, we used cell-specific reporter expression to identify the brainstem pathways of distinct vagal afferent subsets. We show that TRPV1+ vagal afferents innervate ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal/medial nTS subnuclei and the ipsilateral paratrigeminal complex, whereas TRPV1-negative vagal afferents innervate the ipsilateral rostral/ventral/lateral nTS subnuclei and the ipsilateral paratrigeminal complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Likelihood Based Learning Rule for Temporal Coding In Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2002.05619v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05619</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNN) in the brain learn to perform a wide
range of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks very efficiently in terms of
time and energy consumption. This is due to the optimality of coding and
learning schemes, which have yet to be unveiled. The formulation of
biologically inspired networks capable to perform complex computations can
mediate a synergetic interaction between Machine Learning and Neuroscience
bringing to mutual benefits and helping to improve our understanding of
biological and artificial intelligence. Even though several models have been
proposed, it remains a challenging task to design RSNNs which use biologically
plausible mechanisms. We propose a general probabilistic framework which relies
on the principle of maximizing the likelihood for the network to solve the
task. This principle permits to analytically work out an explicit and
completely local plasticity rule supporting the efficient solution of several
tasks. We show that the learning algorithm can be achieved in a very few
iterations, and that the online approximation of the likelihood maximization is
extremely beneficial to fast learning. Our model is very general and it can be
applied to a wide variety of network architectures and types of biological
neurons. The derived plasticity learning rule is specific to each neuron model
producing a theoretical prediction which can be verified experimentally.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: End-to-end semantic segmentation of personalized deep brain structures for non-invasive brain stimulation. (arXiv:2002.05487v1 [eess.IV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electro-stimulation or modulation of deep brain regions is commonly used in
clinical procedures for the treatment of several nervous system disorders. In
particular, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely used as an
affordable clinical application that is applied through electrodes attached to
the scalp. However, it is difficult to determine the amount and distribution of
the electric field (EF) in the different brain regions due to anatomical
complexity and high inter-subject variability. Personalized tDCS is an emerging
clinical procedure that is used to tolerate electrode montage for accurate
targeting. This procedure is guided by computational head models generated from
anatomical images such as MRI. Distribution of the EF in segmented head models
can be calculated through simulation studies. Therefore, fast, accurate, and
feasible segmentation of different brain structures would lead to a better
adjustment for customized tDCS studies. In this study, a single-encoder
multi-decoders convolutional neural network is proposed for deep brain
segmentation. The proposed architecture is trained to segment seven deep brain
structures using T1-weighted MRI. Network generated models are compared with a
reference model constructed using a semi-automatic method, and it presents a
high matching especially in Thalamus (Dice Coefficient (DC) = 94.70%), Caudate
(DC = 91.98%) and Putamen (DC = 90.31%) structures. Electric field distribution
during tDCS in generated and reference models matched well each other,
suggesting its potential usefulness in clinical practice.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Monosynaptically-restricted transsynaptic tracing using deletion-mutant rabies virus (RV) has become a widely used technique in neuroscience, allowing identification, imaging, and manipulation of neurons directly presynaptic to a starting neuronal population. Its most common implementation is to use Cre mouse lines in combination with Cre-dependent “helper” adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to supply the required genes to the targeted population before subsequent injection of a first-generation (ΔG) rabies viral vector. Here we show that the efficiency of transsynaptic spread and the degree of nonspecific labeling in wild-type control animals depend strongly on the concentrations of these helper AAVs. Our results suggest practical guidelines for achieving good results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Peripheral Delta Opioid Receptors Mediate Formoterol Anti-allodynic Effect in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition for which current therapies often remain unsatisfactory. Chronic administration of β2 adrenergic agonists, including formoterol currently used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alleviates mechanical allodynia in the sciatic nerve cuff model of neuropathic pain. The limited clinical data currently available also suggest that formoterol would be a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. The antiallodynic action of β2 adrenergic agonists is known to require activation of the delta-opioid (DOP) receptor but better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved is necessary. Using a mouse line in which DOP receptors were selectively ablated in neurons expressing Nav1.8 sodium channels (DOP cKO), we showed that these DOP peripheral receptors were necessary for the antiallodynic action of the β2 adrenergic agonist formoterol in the cuff model. Using a knock-in mouse line expressing a fluorescent version of the DOP receptor fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (DOPeGFP), we established in a previous study, that mechanical allodynia is associated with a smaller percentage of DOPeGFP positive small peptidergic sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), with a reduced density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin and with increased DOPeGFP expression at the cell surface. Here, we showed that the density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin is partially restored and no increase in DOPeGFP translocation to the plasma membrane is observed in mice in which mechanical pain is alleviated upon chronic oral administration of formoterol. This study, therefore, extends our previous results by confirming that changes in the mechanical threshold are associated with changes in peripheral DOP profile. It also highlights the common impact on DOP receptors between serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine and the β2 mimetic formoterol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00003</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire (WFQ) are two of the most widely used questionnaires to assess lateralized everyday behavior in human participants. However, it is unclear to what extent the specific behavior assessed in these questionnaires elicit lateralized neural activity when performed in real-life situations. To illuminate this unresolved issue, we assessed EEG alpha and beta asymmetries during real-life performance of the behaviors assessed in the EHI and WFQ using a mobile EEG system. This methodology provides high ecological validity for studying neural correlates of motor behavior under more naturalistic conditions. Our results indicate that behavioral performance of items of both the EHI and WFQ differentiate between left- and right-handers and left- and right-footers on the neural level, especially in the alpha frequency band. These results were unaffected by movement parameters. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that neural activity elicited specifically during left-sided task performance provides predictive power for the EHI or WFQ score of the participants. Overall, our results show that these prominent questionnaires not only distinguish between different motor preferences on the behavioral level, but also on the neurophysiological level. Furthermore, we could show that mobile EEG systems are a powerful tool to investigate motor asymmetries in ecologically valid situations outside of the laboratory setting. Future research should focus on other lateralized behavioral phenotypes in real-life settings to provide more insights into lateralized motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main hypothesis of this work is that the time of delay in reaction to an unexpected event can be predicted on the basis of the brain activity recorded prior to that event. Such mental activity can be represented by electroencephalographic data. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a novel experiment involving 19 participants that took part in a 2-h long session of simulated aircraft flights. An EEG signal processing pipeline is proposed that consists of signal preprocessing, extracting bandpass features, and using regression to predict the reaction times. The prediction algorithms that are used in this study are the Least Absolute Shrinkage Operator and its Least Angle Regression modification, as well as Kernel Ridge and Radial Basis Support Vector Machine regression. The average Mean Absolute Error obtained across the 19 subjects was 114 ms. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to predict reaction times on the basis of EEG data. The presented solution can serve as a foundation for a system that can, in the future, increase the safety of air traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research is increasingly focusing on promoting healthy aging and the related extension of the health span by targeting crucial biological processes responsible for age-related conditions. While age-related gradual changes in steroid hormones such as testosterone, estradiol, or cortisol are well described in men, their interactions among each other or with genetic markers have not been sufficiently investigated with regard to physical health or psychological well-being. More specifically, the examination of age-related alterations in hormone interactions and the androgen receptor polymorphism, which modulates androgen action on target cells, in relation to physical health and psychological well-being represents a promising avenue for research on healthy aging in men. A total of 97 healthy aging men provided complete data on psychometric health measures as well as hormonal and genetic parameters at baseline and a 4-year follow-up assessment. Fasting saliva samples were taken at 8:00 am under standardized laboratory conditions, while the androgen receptor gene polymorphism was analyzed from dried blood spots. Longitudinal analyses revealed that psychological well-being and physical health remained stable over time. Analyses indicated that E2 moderated the course of psychological well-being, while the androgen receptor gene polymorphism moderated the course of physical health. Further, T was a strong predictor of physical health. These results suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis might be important for the maintenance of psychological well-being in men, while physical health depends more on interindividual differences in the androgen receptor gene and T.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy Utlilize More Cortical Resources for Similar Motor Output During Treadmill Gait</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) walk independently although with an asymmetrical, more poorly coordinated pattern compared to their peers. While gait biomechanics in unilateral CP and their alteration from those without CP have been well documented, cortical mechanisms underlying gait remain inadequately understood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) during treadmill gait in older children with and without CP. Lower limb surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected and muscle synergy analyses performed to quantify motor output. Our primary goal was to evaluate the relationships between cortical and muscle activation within and across groups and hemispheres to provide novel insights into neural control of gait and how it may be disrupted by an early unilateral brain injury. Participants included 9 children with unilateral CP, mean age 16.0 ± 2.7 years, and 12 with typical development (TD), mean age 14.8 ± 3.0 years. EEG data were collected during a standing baseline and treadmill walking at self-selected speed. EMG of 16 lower limb muscles were also collected bilaterally and synchronized with EEG. No significant group differences were found in synergy number or structure across groups. Six cortical clusters were identified as having gait-related activation and all contained participants from both CP and TD groups; however, the percent of individuals per group appearing in different clusters varied. Notably, the cluster least represented in CP was the non-dominant motor region. Both groups showed mu-band ERD in the motor clusters during gait although sustained beta-band ERD was not evident in TD. The CP group showed greater cortical activation than TD during walking as measured by mu- and beta-ERD in the dominant and non-dominant motor and parietal regions and elevated low gamma-activity in the frontal and parietal areas, a unique finding in CP. CP showed greater bilateral motor EEG-EMG coherence in the gamma-band with the hallucis longus compared to TD. In summary, individuals with CP display increased cortical activation during gait possibly relating to differences in distal motor control of the more affected side. Strategies that iteratively reduce cortical activation while improving selective motor control are needed in CP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulating Brain Networks With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Over the Primary Motor Cortex: A Concurrent TMS/fMRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimulating the primary motor cortex (M1) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) causes unique multisensory experience such as the targeted muscle activity, afferent/reafferent sensory feedback, tactile sensation over the scalp and “click” sound. Although the human M1 has been intensively investigated using TMS, the experience of the M1 stimulation has not been elucidated at the whole brain. Here, using concurrent TMS/fMRI, we investigated the acute effect of the M1 stimulation of functional brain networks during task and at rest. A short train of 1 Hz TMS pulses applied to individuals’ hand area in the M1 during motor execution or at rest. Employing the independent component analysis (ICA), we showed the M1 stimulation decreased the motor networks activity when the networks were engaged in the task and increased the deactivation of networks when the networks were not involved in the ongoing task. The M1 stimulation induced the activation in the key networks involved in bodily self-consciousness (BSC) including the insular and rolandic operculum systems regardless of states. The degree of activation in these networks was prominent at rest compared to task conditions, showing the state-dependent TMS effect. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the M1 stimulation modulated other domain-general networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and attention network and the inter-network connectivity between these networks. Our results showed that the M1 stimulation induced the widespread changes in the brain at the targeted system as well as non-motor, remote brain networks, specifically related to the BSC. Our findings shed light on understanding the neural mechanism of the complex and multisensory experience of the M1 stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The affordance competition hypothesis is an ethologically inspired theory from cognitive neuroscience that provides an integrative neural account of continuous, real-time behavior, and will likely become increasingly relevant to the growing field of neuroergonomics. In the spirit of neuroergonomics in aviation, we designed a three-dimensional, first-person, continuous, and real-time fMRI task during which human subjects maneuvered a simulated airplane in pursuit of a target airplane along constantly changing headings. We introduce a pseudo-event-related, parametric fMRI analysis approach to begin testing the affordance competition hypothesis in neuroergonomic contexts, and attempt to identify regions of the brain that exhibit a linear metabolic relationship with the continuous variables of task performance and distance-from-target. In line with the affordance competition hypothesis, our results implicate the cooperation of the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cortex in such a task, with greater involvement of the basal ganglia during good performance, and greater involvement of cortex and cerebellum during poor performance and when distance-from-target closes. We briefly review the somatic marker and dysmetria of thought hypotheses, in addition to the affordance competition hypothesis, to speculate on the intricacies of the cooperation of these brain regions in a task such as ours. In doing so, we demonstrate how the affordance competition hypothesis and other cognitive neuroscience theories are ready for testing in continuous, real-time tasks such as ours, and in other neuroergonomic settings more generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evaluation of EEG Headset Mounting for Brain-Computer Interface-Based Stroke Rehabilitation by Patients, Therapists, and Relatives</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have successfully been used for motor recovery training in stroke patients. However, the setup of BCI systems is complex and may be divided into (1) mounting the headset and (2) calibration of the BCI. One of the major problems is mounting the headset for recording brain activity in a stroke rehabilitation context, and usability testing of this is limited. In this study, the aim was to compare the translational aspects of mounting five different commercially available headsets from a user perspective and investigate the design considerations associated with technology transfer to rehabilitation clinics and home use. No EEG signals were recorded, so the effectiveness of the systems have not been evaluated. Three out of five headsets covered the motor cortex which is needed to pick up movement intentions of attempted movements. The other two were as control and reference for potential design considerations. As primary stakeholders, nine stroke patients, eight therapists and two relatives participated; the stroke patients mounted the headsets themselves. The setup time was recorded, and participants filled in questionnaires related to comfort, aesthetics, setup complexity, overall satisfaction, and general design considerations. The patients had difficulties in mounting all headsets except for a headband with a dry electrode located on the forehead (control). The therapists and relatives were able to mount all headsets. The fastest headset to mount was the headband, and the most preferred headsets were the headband and a behind-ear headset (control). The most preferred headset that covered the motor cortex used water-based electrodes. The patients reported that it was important that they could mount the headset themselves for them to use it every day at home. These results have implications for design considerations for the development of BCI systems to be used in rehabilitation clinics and in the patient’s home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Altered Functional Connectivity in the Motor and Prefrontal Cortex for Children With Down's Syndrome: An fNIRS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00006</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00006</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Children with Down's syndrome (DS) might exhibit disrupted brain functional connectivity in the motor and prefrontal cortex. To inspect the alterations in brain activation and functional connectivity for children with DS, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) method was applied to examine the brain activation difference in the motor and prefrontal cortex between the DS and typically developing (TD) groups during a fine motor task. In addition, small-world analysis based on graph theory was also carried out to characterize the topological organization of functional brain networks. Interestingly, behavior data demonstrated that the DS group showed significantly long reaction time and low accuracy as compared to the TD group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). More importantly, significantly reduced brain activations in the frontopolar area, the pre-motor, and the supplementary motor cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.05) were identified in the DS group compared with the TD group. Meanwhile, significantly high global efficiency (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) and short average path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) were also detected for the DS group. This pilot study illustrated that the disrupted connectivity of frontopolar area, pre-motor, and supplementary motor cortex might be one of the core mechanisms associated with motor and cognitive impairments for children with DS. Therefore, the combination of the fNIRS technique with functional network analysis may pave a new avenue for improving our understanding of the neural mechanisms of DS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Segmenting Brain Tumor Using Cascaded V-Nets in Multimodal MR Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00009</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00009</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a novel cascaded V-Nets method to segment brain tumor substructures in multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Although V-Net has been successfully used in many segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that its performance could be further enhanced by using a cascaded structure and ensemble strategy. Briefly, our baseline V-Net consists of four levels with encoding and decoding paths and intra- and inter-path skip connections. Focal loss is chosen to improve performance on hard samples as well as balance the positive and negative samples. We further propose three preprocessing pipelines for multimodal magnetic resonance images to train different models. By ensembling the segmentation probability maps obtained from these models, segmentation result is further improved. In other hand, we propose to segment the whole tumor first, and then divide it into tumor necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor. Experimental results on BraTS 2018 online validation set achieve average Dice scores of 0.9048, 0.8364, and 0.7748 for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. The corresponding values for BraTS 2018 online testing set are 0.8761, 0.7953, and 0.7364, respectively. We also evaluate the proposed method in two additional data sets from local hospitals comprising of 28 and 28 subjects, and the best results are 0.8635, 0.8036, and 0.7217, respectively. We further make a prediction of patient overall survival by ensembling multiple classifiers for long, mid and short groups, and achieve accuracy of 0.519, mean square error of 367240 and Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.168 for BraTS 2018 online testing set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acute Ablation of Cortical Pericytes Leads to Rapid Neurovascular Uncoupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00027</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00027</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are perivascular mural cells that enwrap brain capillaries and maintain blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Most studies suggest that pericytes regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery to activated brain structures, known as neurovascular coupling. While we have previously shown that congenital loss of pericytes leads over time to aberrant hemodynamic responses, the effects of acute global pericyte loss on neurovascular coupling have not been studied. To address this, we used our recently reported inducible pericyte-specific Cre mouse line crossed to iDTR mice carrying Cre-dependent human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor, which upon DT treatment leads to acute pericyte ablation. As expected, DT led to rapid progressive loss of pericyte coverage of cortical capillaries up to 50% at 3 days post-DT, which correlated with approximately 50% reductions in stimulus-induced CBF responses measured with laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) and/or intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging. Endothelial response to acetylcholine, microvascular density, and neuronal evoked membrane potential responses remained, however, unchanged, as well as arteriolar smooth muscle cell (SMC) coverage and functional responses to adenosine, as we previously reported. Together, these data suggest that neurovascular uncoupling in this model is driven by pericyte loss, but not other vascular deficits or neuronal dysfunction. These results further support the role of pericytes in CBF regulation and may have implications for neurological conditions associated with rapid pericyte loss such as hypoperfusion and stroke, as well as conditions where the exact time course of global regional pericyte loss is less clear, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurogenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Long-range correlation in protein dynamics: Confirmation by structural data and normal mode analysis</title>

Proteins in cellular environments are highly susceptible. Local perturbations to any residue can be sensed by other spatially distal residues in the protein molecule, showing long-range correlations in the native dynamics of proteins. The long-range correlations of proteins contribute to many biological processes such as allostery, catalysis, and transportation. Revealing the structural origin of such long-range correlations is of great significance in understanding the design principle of biologically functional proteins. In this work, based on a large set of globular proteins determined by X-ray crystallography, by conducting normal mode analysis with the elastic network models, we demonstrate that such long-range correlations are encoded in the native topology of the proteins. To understand how native topology defines the structure and the dynamics of the proteins, we conduct scaling analysis on the size dependence of the slowest vibration mode, average path length, and modularity. Our results quantitatively describe how native proteins balance between order and disorder, showing both dense packing and fractal topology. It is suggested that the balance between stability and flexibility acts as an evolutionary constraint for proteins at different sizes. Overall, our result not only gives a new perspective bridging the protein structure and its dynamics but also reveals a universal principle in the evolution of proteins at all different sizes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xgp8VavKYu8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Coding with transient trajectories in recurrent neural networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Giulio Bondanelli, Srdjan Ostojic&lt;/p&gt;

Following a stimulus, the neural response typically strongly varies in time and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through dynamics. Yet the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a population code based on transient trajectories have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine transient coding in a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of recurrently connected units. We start by reviewing a well-known result that leads to a distinction between two classes of networks: networks in which all inputs lead to weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs elicit amplified transient responses and are mapped onto output states during the dynamics. Theses two classes are simply distinguished based on the spectrum of the symmetric part of the connectivity matrix. For the second class of networks, which is a sub-class of non-normal networks, we provide a procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the corresponding readouts. We first apply these results to standard randomly-connected and two-population networks. We then build minimal, low-rank networks that robustly implement trajectories mapping a specific input onto a specific orthogonal output state. Finally, we demonstrate that the capacity of the obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rcywPQiYpl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SuperFreq: Integrated mutation detection and clonal tracking in cancer</title>

Analysing multiple cancer samples from an individual patient can provide insight into the way the disease evolves. Monitoring the expansion and contraction of distinct clones helps to reveal the mutations that initiate the disease and those that drive progression. Existing approaches for clonal tracking from sequencing data typically require the user to combine multiple tools that are not purpose-built for this task. Furthermore, most methods require a matched normal (non-tumour) sample, which limits the scope of application. We developed SuperFreq, a cancer exome sequencing analysis pipeline that integrates identification of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number alterations (CNAs) and clonal tracking for both. SuperFreq does not require a matched normal and instead relies on unrelated controls. When analysing multiple samples from a single patient, SuperFreq cross checks variant calls to improve clonal tracking, which helps to separate somatic from germline variants, and to resolve overlapping CNA calls. To demonstrate our software we analysed 304 cancer-normal exome samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and evaluated the quality of the SNV and CNA calls. We simulated clonal evolution through &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; mixing of cancer and normal samples in known proportion. We found that SuperFreq identified 93% of clones with a cellular fraction of at least 50% and mutations were assigned to the correct clone with high recall and precision. In addition, SuperFreq maintained a similar level of performance for most aspects of the analysis when run without a matched normal. SuperFreq is highly versatile and can be applied in many different experimental settings for the analysis of exomes and other capture libraries. We demonstrate an application of SuperFreq to leukaemia patients with diagnosis and relapse samples.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S71B70hPQFM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A generative growth model for thalamocortical axonal branching in primary visual cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Pegah Kassraian-Fard, Michael Pfeiffer, Roman Bauer&lt;/p&gt;

Axonal morphology displays large variability and complexity, yet the canonical regularities of the cortex suggest that such wiring is based on the repeated initiation of a small set of genetically encoded rules. Extracting underlying developmental principles can hence shed light on what genetically encoded instructions must be available during cortical development. Within a generative model, we investigate growth rules for axonal branching patterns in cat area 17, originating from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This target area of synaptic connections is characterized by extensive ramifications and a high bouton density, characteristics thought to preserve the spatial resolution of receptive fields and to enable connections for the ocular dominance columns. We compare individual and global statistics, such as a newly introduced length-weighted asymmetry index and the global segment-length distribution, of generated and biological branching patterns as the benchmark for growth rules. We show that the proposed model surpasses the statistical accuracy of the Galton-Watson model, which is the most commonly employed model for biological growth processes. In contrast to the Galton-Watson model, our model can recreate the log-normal segment-length distribution of the experimental dataset and is considerably more accurate in recreating individual axonal morphologies. To provide a biophysical interpretation for statistical quantifications of the axonal branching patterns, the generative model is ported into the physically accurate simulation framework of Cx3D. In this 3D simulation environment we demonstrate how the proposed growth process can be formulated as an interactive process between genetic growth rules and chemical cues in the local environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bBkA2yZdoqg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Ischemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25700?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25700?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unknown whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with ischaemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy are at increased risk for further recurrent strokes and how ongoing secondary prevention should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data pooled analysis of seven prospective cohort studies which recruited patients with AF and cerebral ischemia. We compared patients taking oral anticoagulants (Vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) prior to index event (OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt;) with those without prior anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt;). We further compared those who changed the type (i.e. from VKA or DOAC, vice versa or DOAC to DOAC) of anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt;) with those who continued the same anticoagulation as secondary prevention (OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt;). Time to recurrent ischaemic stroke (AIS) was analysed using multivariate competing risk Fine‐Gray models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 5413 patients (median age 78years [IQR 71‐84years], 5136 [96.7%] had ischaemic stroke as the index event (median NIHSS‐on‐admission 6 [IQR 2‐12]). The median CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score was 5 (IQR4‐6) and not different between OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; (n=1195) and OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt; (n=4119, p=0.103). During 6128 patient‐years of follow‐up, 289 patients had AIS (4.7%/year, 95%CI 4.2‐5.3%). OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; was associated with an increased risk of AIS (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.2‐2.3, p=0.005). OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt; (n=307) was not associated with decreased risk of AIS (HR 1.2, 95%CI 0.7‐2.1, p=0.415) compared with OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt; (n=585).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AF who have a stroke despite oral anticoagulation once are at a higher risk for recurrent strokes despite a similar CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score to those without prior oral anticoagulation. Better prevention strategies are needed for this high risk patient group.&lt;/p&gt;

Although neurons are highly polarized and their structure is often maintained throughout the life of an organism, MTs can remain dynamic in axons and dendrites, undergoing bouts of polymerization and depolymerization, referred to as dynamic instability. Furthermore, MTs can be nucleated outside of the centrosome or MT organizing center (MTOC) that is located in the cell body, allowing dynamic formation and branching of MT polymers throughout the neuron. Together, these recent findings point to a much more dynamic landscape of microtubules in developing and mature neurons than was previously appreciated. Here we will focus on recent studies that show MT dynamics are playing a role at the synapse, both post-synaptically in dendrites and pre-synaptically in axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: NMDA receptor antibodies in autoimmune encephalopathy alter oligodendrocyte function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25699?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSF of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and AMPARs in vitro after exposure to patients'CSF antibodies or SSM5 we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodencrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMDAR agonists responses were robustly reduced after pre‐incubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF, or SSM5, but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR‐specific as patients' CSFs did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and were abrogated by pre‐absorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Additionally, patients' CSF reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDAR in oligodendrocytes causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDAR in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning networks have been trained to recognize speech, caption
photographs and translate text between languages at high levels of performance.
Although applications of deep learning networks to real world problems have
become ubiquitous, our understanding of why they are so effective is lacking.
These empirical results should not be possible according to sample complexity
in statistics and non-convex optimization theory. However, paradoxes in the
training and effectiveness of deep learning networks are being investigated and
insights are being found in the geometry of high-dimensional spaces. A
mathematical theory of deep learning would illuminate how they function, allow
us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different network architectures
and lead to major improvements. Deep learning has provided natural ways for
humans to communicate with digital devices and is foundational for building
artificial general intelligence. Deep learning was inspired by the architecture
of the cerebral cortex and insights into autonomy and general intelligence may
be found in other brain regions that are essential for planning and survival,
but major breakthroughs will be needed to achieve these goals.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although social neuroscience is concerned with understanding how the brain
interacts with its social environment, prevailing research in the field has
primarily considered the human brain in isolation, deprived of its rich social
context. Emerging work in social neuroscience that leverages tools from network
analysis has begun to pursue this issue, advancing knowledge of how the human
brain influences and is influenced by the structures of its social environment.
In this paper, we provide an overview of key theory and methods in network
analysis (especially for social systems) as an introduction for social
neuroscientists who are interested in relating individual cognition to the
structures of an individual's social environments. We also highlight some
exciting new work as examples of how to productively use these tools to
investigate questions of relevance to social neuroscientists. We include
tutorials to help with practical implementation of the concepts that we
discuss. We conclude by highlighting a broad range of exciting research
opportunities for social neuroscientists who are interested in using network
analysis to study social systems.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Eph/ephrin Function Contributes to the Patterning of Spinocerebellar Mossy Fibers Into Parasagittal Zones</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purkinje cell microcircuits perform diverse functions using widespread inputs from the brain and spinal cord. The formation of these functional circuits depends on developmental programs and molecular pathways that organize mossy fiber afferents from different sources into a complex and precisely patterned map within the granular layer of the cerebellum. During development, Purkinje cell zonal patterns are thought to guide mossy fiber terminals into zones. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process remain unclear. Here, we used knockout mice to test whether Eph/ephrin signaling controls Purkinje cell-mossy fiber interactions during cerebellar circuit formation. Loss of ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 disrupted the patterning of spinocerebellar terminals into discrete zones. Zone territories in the granular layer that normally have limited spinocerebellar input contained ectopic terminals in ephrin-A2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;;ephrin-A5&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; double knockout mice. However, the overall morphology of the cerebellum, lobule position, and Purkinje cell zonal patterns developed normally in the ephrin-A2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;;ephrin-A5&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice. This work suggests that communication between Purkinje cell zones and mossy fibers during postnatal development allows contact-dependent molecular cues to sharpen the innervation of sensory afferents into functional zones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Topological Cluster of Differentially Regulated Genes in Mice Lacking PER3</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polymorphisms in the human circadian clock gene PERIOD3 (PER3) are associated with a wide variety of phenotypes such as diurnal preference, delayed sleep phase disorder, sleep homeostasis, cognitive performance, bipolar disorder, type 2 diabetes, cardiac regulation, cancer, light sensitivity, hormone and cytokine secretion, and addiction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic associations remain unknown. Per3 knockout mice (Per3&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) have phenotypes related to activity, sleep homeostasis, anhedonia, metabolism, and behavioral responses to light. Using a protocol that induces behavioral differences in response to light in wild type and Per3&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we compared genome-wide expression in the eye and hypothalamus in the two genotypes. Differentially expressed transcripts were related to inflammation, taste, olfactory and melatonin receptors, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and hormones, as well as receptors and channels related to sleep regulation. Differentially expressed transcripts in both tissues co-localized with Per3 on an ∼8Mbp region of distal chromosome 4. The most down-regulated transcript is Prdm16, which is involved in adipocyte differentiation and may mediate altered body mass accumulation in Per3&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. eQTL analysis with BXD mouse strains showed that the expression of some of these transcripts and also others co-localized at distal chromosome 4, is correlated with brain tissue expression levels of Per3 with a highly significant linkage to genetic variation in that region. These data identify a cluster of transcripts on mouse distal chromosome 4 that are co-regulated with Per3 and whose expression levels correlate with those of Per3. This locus lies within a topologically associating domain island that contains many genes with functional links to several of the diverse non-circadian phenotypes associated with polymorphisms in human PER3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neurovascular Coupling by Functional Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy and Sport-Related Concussion in Retired Rugby Players: The UK Rugby Health Project</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aim: This study investigated cerebral hemodynamic responses to a neurovascular coupling (NVC) test in retired contact athletes with a history of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and in controls with no history of mTBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-one retired rugby players (47.7 ± 12.9 year old; age at retirement: 38.5 ± 8.9 year; number of years playing rugby: 12.7 ± 3.7 year) with a history of three or more diagnosed concussions (8.9 ± 7.9 concussions per player) and 23 controls with no history of mTBI (46.5 ± 12.8 year old) performed a NVC test to detect task-orientated cerebral hemodynamic changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The NVC showed a statistically significant reduction in the cerebral hemodynamic response in comparison to the control group which had a greater relative increase of oxyhemoglobin (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hb). There were reductions in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hb (−0.015 ± 0.258 μM) and relative increases in deoxyhemoglobin (HHb; −0.004 ± 0.159 μM) in the same region for the mTBI group in comparison to the control group (−0.160 ± 0.311 μM; −0.121 ± 0.076 μM for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hb and HHb, respectively). The mTBI group induced a greater rate of oxygen extraction compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This was the first study to examine cerebral hemodynamic changes in retired rugby players in response to a NVC test, and we found reduced cerebral hemodynamic responses in participants with a history of mTBI compared to controls. These results suggest altered cerebral metabolic demands in participants with a history of multiple head injuries. Further research is needed to ascertain an understanding of the changes in hemodynamics from playing into retirement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Similarity Between Chinese Five-Pattern and Eysenck’s Personality Traits: Evidence From Theory and Resting-State fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00038</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese five-pattern and Eysenck’s personality traits are two types of personality theories based on different cultural backgrounds. The former is an indigenous theory, and the latter is a cross-cultural theory. In order to verify the relationship between two different personality traits from theory and neuropsychology, the current study recruited 170 healthy adults to calculate their five-Pattern Personality Inventory (FPPI) and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ) scales and to scan their brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, we performed stepwise-regression analysis and mediation-effect analysis to explore the association between brain regional homogeneity (ReHo) and two types of personality traits. The results showed that the ReHo of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) positively correlated with TaiYang traits for FPPI and that there was a significant linear relationship with extraversion and neuroticism for EPQ. Besides, the ReHo of the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) positively correlated with TaiYin for FPPI, and it also showed a significant linear relationship with neuroticism for EPQ. Furthermore, we found that extroversion and neuroticism partially mediated the relationship between five-pattern personality traits and the regional brain function, based on the mediation-effect analysis. Our findings suggest that Chinese five-pattern personality traits have a close relationship with Eysenck’s personality traits and that both may be engaged in similar neurobiological mechanisms in common brain regions to some extent. Hence, these findings first reveal a relationship between Chinese traditional personality traits and Western Eysenck’s personality traits in terms of both theoretical and neurobiological contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT)-1, the major GABA transporter in the brain, plays a key role in modulating GABA signaling and is involved in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric diseases, including epilepsy. The original description of GAT-1 as a neuronal transporter has guided the interpretation of the findings of all physiological, pharmacological, genetic, or clinical studies. However, evidence published in the past few years, some of which is briefly reviewed herein, does not seem to be consistent with a neurocentric view of GAT-1 function and calls for more detailed analysis of its localization. We therefore performed a thorough systematic assessment of GAT-1 localization in neocortex and subcortical white matter. In line with earlier work, we found that GAT-1 was robustly expressed in axon terminals forming symmetric synapses and in astrocytic processes, whereas its astrocytic expression was more diffuse than expected and, even more surprisingly, immature and mature oligodendrocytes and microglial cells also expressed the transporter. These data indicate that the era of “neuronal” and “glial” GABA transporters has finally come to a close and provide a wider perspective from which to view GABA-mediated physiological phenomena. In addition, given the well-known involvement of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in physiological as well as pathological conditions, the demonstration of functional GAT-1 in these cells is expected to provide greater insight into the phenomena occurring in the diseased brain as well as to prompt a reassessment of earlier findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuroprotection by the Immunomodulatory Drug Pomalidomide in the Drosophila LRRK2WD40 Genetic Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The search for new disease-modifying drugs for Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a slow and highly expensive process, and the repurposing of drugs already approved for different medical indications is becoming a compelling alternative option for researchers. Genetic variables represent a predisposing factor to the disease and mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) locus have been correlated to late-onset autosomal-dominant PD. The common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster carrying the mutation LRRK2 loss-of-function in the WD40 domain (LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt;), is a simple in vivo model of PD and is a valid tool to first evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to the disease. Recent studies have suggested a neuroprotective activity of immunomodulatory agents in PD models. Here the immunomodulatory drug Pomalidomide (POM), a Thalidomide derivative, was examined in the Drosophila LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; genetic model of PD. Mutant and wild type flies received increasing POM doses (1, 0.5, 0.25 mM) through their diet from day 1 post eclosion, until postnatal day (PN) 7 or 14, when POM’s actions were evaluated by quantifying changes in climbing behavior as a measure of motor performance, the number of brain dopaminergic neurons and T-bars, mitochondria integrity. LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; flies displayed a spontaneous age-related impairment of climbing activity, and POM significantly and dose-dependently improved climbing performance both at PN 7 and PN 14. LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; fly motor disability was underpinned by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in posterior clusters of the protocerebrum, which are involved in the control of locomotion, by a low number of T-bars density in the presynaptic bouton active zones. POM treatment fully rescued the cell loss in all posterior clusters at PN 7 and PN 14 and significantly increased the T-bars density. Moreover, several damaged mitochondria with dilated cristae were observed in LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; flies treated with vehicle but not following POM. This study demonstrates the neuroprotective activity of the immunomodulatory agent POM in a genetic model of PD. POM is an FDA-approved clinically available and well-tolerated drug used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If further validated in mammalian models of PD, POM could rapidly be clinically tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The global incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is on the rise with the increase in obesity and metabolic disease epidemic. Obesity is co-morbid with the increase in mass of adipose tissue, which secretes numerous molecules that are biologically important. Obesity and its associated conditions are perhaps involved in the causative pathway of AD. Immunologically important cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-18, which are released by adipose tissue, are also found to be associated with AD. Besides, the expression of IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF alpha are also associated with AD. Ang-I and Ang-II are found to mediate the progression of AD. Complement factors B, C4b, and H are differentially expressed in AD. Overall, several adipocyte-derived cytokines are found to be dysregulated in AD, and their role in AD remains to be studied. The induction of autophagy is a very promising strategy in the treatment of AD. A variety of adipose-derived molecules have been shown to modulate autophagy. However, very little literature is available on the role of adipose-derived molecules in inducing autophagy in microglial cells of AD. Understanding the role of adipose-derived molecules in the development of AD, especially in the induction of autophagy, would open up new avenues in devising strategies for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Charles Dykeman&lt;/p&gt;

Computational modelling of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis is highly complicated, as it requires the simulation of ribosomal movement over the entire transcriptome, as well as consideration of the concentration effects from 40+ different types of tRNAs and numerous other protein factors. Here I report on the development of a stochastic model for protein translation that is capable of simulating the dynamical process of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in a prokaryotic cell containing several thousand unique mRNA sequences, with explicit nucleotide information for each, and report on a number of biological predictions which are beyond the scope of existing models. In particular, I show that, when the complex network of concentration dependent interactions between elongation factors, tRNAs, ribosomes, and other factors required for protein synthesis are included in full detail, several biological phenomena, such as the increasing peptide elongation rate with bacterial growth rate, are predicted as emergent properties of the model. The stochastic model presented here demonstrates the importance of considering the translational process at this level of detail, and provides a platform to interrogate various aspects of translation that are difficult to study in more coarse-grained models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHfDF3l3LDU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Molecular diagnosis is an essential step of patient care. An increasing number of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) have been identified that are involved in inherited and somatic diseases. However, there are few existing tools to identify them among amplicon sequencing data generated by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). We present here a new tool, CovCopCan, that allows the rapid and easy detection of CNVs in inherited diseases, as well as somatic data of patients with cancer, even with a low ratio of cancer cells to healthy cells.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, resulting in the progressive decline of cognitive function in patients. Familial forms of AD are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Inflammation and amyloidosis from amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates are implicated in neuron loss and cognitive decline. Inflammation activates the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and this could suppress many signaling pathways that activate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) implicated in neurodegeneration. However, the significance of PTP1B in AD pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B with trodusquemine or selective ablation of PTP1B in neurons prevents hippocampal neuron loss and spatial memory deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model with Aβ pathology (hAPP-J20 mice of both sexes). Intriguingly, while systemic inhibition of PTP1B reduced inflammation in the hippocampus, neuronal PTP1B ablation did not. These results dissociate inflammation from neuronal loss and cognitive decline and demonstrate that neuronal PTP1B hastens neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in this model of AD. The protective effect of PTP1B inhibition or ablation coincides with the restoration of GSK3β inhibition. Neuronal ablation of PTP1B did not affect cerebral amyloid levels or plaque numbers, but reduced Aβ plaque size in the hippocampus. In summary, our preclinical study suggests that targeting PTP1B may be a new strategy to intervene in the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Here, we used a mouse model expressing human amyloid precursor protein bearing two familial mutations and asked whether activation of a phosphatase PTP1B participates in the disease process. Systemic inhibition of this phosphatase using a selective inhibitor prevented cognitive decline, neuron loss in the hippocampus, and attenuated inflammation. Importantly, neuron-targeted ablation of PTP1B also prevented cognitive decline and neuron loss but did not reduce inflammation. Therefore, neuronal loss rather than inflammation was critical for AD progression in this mouse model, and that disease progression could be ameliorated by inhibition of PTP1B.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early Effects of Aβ Oligomers on Dendritic Spine Dynamics and Arborization in Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to impaired memory and cognitive deficits. Spine loss as well as changes in spine morphology correlates with cognitive impairment in this neurological disorder. Many studies in animal models and ex vivo cultures indicate that amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) oligomers induce synaptic damage early during the progression of the disease. Here, in order to determine the events that initiate synaptic alterations, we acutely applied oligomeric Aβ to primary hippocampal neurons and an ex vivo model of organotypic hippocampal cultures from a mouse after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging and algorithm-based evaluation of spine changes. Dendritic spines were classified as thin, stubby or mushroom, based on morphology. In vivo, time-lapse imaging showed that the three spine types were relatively stable, although their stability significantly decreased after treatment with Aβ oligomers. Unexpectedly, we observed that the density of total dendritic spines increased in organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ compared to control cultures. Specifically, the fraction of stubby spines significantly increased, while mushroom and thin spines remained unaltered. Pharmacological tools revealed that acute Aβ oligomers induced spine changes through mechanisms involving CaMKII and integrin β1 activities. Additionally, analysis of dendritic complexity based on a 3D reconstruction of the whole neuron morphology showed an increase in the apical dendrite length and branching points in CA1 organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ. In contrast to spines, the morphological changes were affected by integrin β1 but not by CaMKII inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that the Aβ oligomers exhibit early dual effects by acutely enhancing dendritic complexity and spine density.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reduction of Silent Information Regulator 1 Activates Interleukin-33/ST2 Signaling and Contributes to Neuropathic Pain Induced by Spared Nerve Injury in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging studies have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 act as key factors in inflammatory diseases. Moreover, accumulating evidence has suggested that cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, trigger an inflammatory cascade. SIRT1 has been shown to suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the effects of SIRT1 on IL-33/ST2 signaling and initiation of the inflammatory cascade via modulation of TNF-α and IL-1β by IL-33 remain unclear. In the present study, we found that the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) IL-33 and ST2 were upregulated in a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI) and intrathecal injection of either IL-33 or ST2 antibodies alleviated mechanical allodynia and downregulated TNF-α and IL-1β induced by SNI. In addition, activation of SIRT1 decreased enhanced DRG IL-33/ST2 signaling in SNI rats. Artificial inactivation of SIRT1 via intrathecal injection of an SIRT1 antagonist could induce mechanical allodynia and upregulate IL-33 and ST2. These results demonstrated that reduction in SIRT1 could induce upregulation of DRG IL-33 and ST2 and contribute to mechanical allodynia induced by SNI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Atypical Social Attention and Emotional Face Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Insights From Face Scanning and Pupillometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00076</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social attention deficits are a hallmark characteristic within autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and have been hypothesized to have cascading effects on emotion recognition. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged as a potentially reliable, feasible, and sensitive biomarker for examining core phenotypic features of ASD; however, these findings are mixed with regards to measuring treatment change in clinical trials. The present study aimed to assess the utility of an eye-tracking paradigm to discriminate between clinical groups in social attention and emotion recognition through face scanning and pupillometry. The present study also assessed the reliability of this paradigm within the ASD sample to further our understanding of the utility of eye-tracking for future clinical trials. Participants included 42 individuals with ASD, 29 developmental disability (DD) controls, and 62 typically developing (TD) controls between 3 and 25 years of age. An emotional faces eye-tracking paradigm was administered to all participants, with the ASD group completing the paradigm a second time approximately 2 months later. Participants’ average proportion of looking and number of fixations to specific areas of interest (AOI) were examined along with changes in pupil reactivity while viewing different emotional faces. Results suggest atypical face-scanning through a reduced proportion of looking and the number of fixations toward the eyes in the ASD group regardless of the emotion that was presented. Further, pupillometry measures were able to detect increases in pupil dilation to happy faces in the ASD group. Lastly, test-retest reliability coefficients varied between the poor and excellent range based on the mechanism assessed, with the proportion of looking demonstrating the highest reliability coefficients. These findings build on the promise of eye-tracking as a feasible and reliable biomarker for identifying social attention and emotion recognition deficits in ASD. Detecting differences in emotion recognition explicitly through facial scanning was not as clear. Specific mechanisms within the eye-tracking paradigm may be viable options for assessing treatment-specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Fiber Connectivity Density in Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease Patients With Normal Cognition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Abnormal structural connectivity of cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. But the different characteristics of structural connectivity have not been elucidated in early CSVD patients. The current study aimed to investigate the potential differences of structural connectivity in CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and CSVD patients with normal cognition. Twenty-two CSVD patients with MCI, 34 CSVD patients with normal cognition, and 35 controls, who were age, sex, and education matched underwent diffusion tensor imaging and high resolution T1-weighted imaging. Clinical characteristics, lacunar infarct volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and global atrophy were quantitatively evaluated. Maps of fiber connectivity density (FiCD) were constructed and compared across groups in vertex levels. Pearson correlation was used to estimate the imaging–clinical relationships with control of general characteristics. CSVD patients with MCI had higher lesion load of WMH and lacunar infarcts, and correspondingly lower global FiCD value than CSVD patients with normal cognition (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Lacunar infarct (r = −0.318, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and WMH (r = −0.400, P &amp;lt; 0.01), but not global atrophy, age, or sex, were significantly correlated with the global FiCD value. CSVD patients with normal cognition showed decreased FiCD value mainly in the prefrontal areas (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Compared with CSVD patients with normal cognition, CSVD patients with MCI showed significantly decreased FiCD value in enlarged frontal and parietal areas (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Inter-group comparisons showed regional enhanced impairment of connectivity density in CSVD patients with MCI in the left superior frontal gyrus, the left precuneus, and the orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Regional FiCD value of frontal and parietal areas was associated with the cognitive function (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, cognitively normal CSVD patients already have disruptions of structural connectivity. The extent and intensity of connectivity disruptions in frontal and parietal areas may underlie the mechanism of cognitive impairment in CSVD. Fiber connectivity density measurements may be helpful for quantitative description of structural cortical connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Hypernetwork Construction and Feature Fusion Analysis Based on Sparse Group Lasso Method on Functional fMRI Dataset</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent works have shown that the resting-state brain functional connectivity hypernetwork, where multiple nodes can be connected, are an effective technique for brain disease diagnosis and classification research. The lasso method was used to construct hypernetworks by solving sparse linear regression models in previous research. But, constructing a hypernetwork based on the lasso method simply selects a single variable, in that it lacks the ability to interpret the grouping effect. Considering the group structure problem, the previous study proposed to create a hypernetwork based on the elastic net and the group lasso methods, and the results showed that the former method had the best classification performance. However, the highly correlated variables selected by the elastic net method were not necessarily in the active set in the group. Therefore, we extended our research to address this issue. Herein, we propose a new method that introduces the sparse group lasso method to improve the construction of the hypernetwork by solving the group structure problem of the brain regions. We used the traditional lasso, group lasso method, and sparse group lasso method to construct a hypernetwork in patients with depression and normal subjects. Meanwhile, other clustering coefficients (clustering coefficients based on pairs of nodes) were also introduced to extract features with traditional clustering coefficients. Two types of features with significant differences obtained after feature selection were subjected to multi-kernel learning for feature fusion and classification using each method, respectively. The network topology results revealed differences among the three networks, where hypernetwork using the lasso method was the strictest; the group lasso, most lenient; and the sgLasso method, moderate. The network topology of the sparse group lasso method was similar to that of the group lasso method but different from the lasso method. The classification results show that the sparse group lasso method achieves the best classification accuracy by using multi-kernel learning, which indicates that better classification performance can be achieved when the group structure exists and is properly extended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pre-frontal Cortex Oxygenation Changes During Aerobic Exercise in Elite Athletes Experiencing Sport-Related Concussion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00035</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aims: Recent research suggests that aerobic exercise can be performed safely within the first week following a concussion injury and that early initiation of exercise may speed recovery. To better understand the physiological changes during a concussion, we tested the hypothesis that mild-to-intense exercise testing can be performed within days immediately following injury, and can be used to discern differences between the concussed and normal healthy state. Thus, the purpose was to observe the cerebral hemodynamic responses to incremental exercise testing performed acutely post-concussion in high-performance athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study was a within- and between-experimental design, with seven male university ice hockey teams participating. A subgroup of five players acted as control subjects (CON) and was tested at the same time as the 14 concussed (mTBI) players on Day 2, 4, and 7 post-concussion. A 5-min resting baseline and 5-min exercise bouts of mild (EX1), moderate (EX2), and high (EX3) intensity exercise were performed on a cycle ergometer. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor pre-frontal cortex oxy-haemoglobin (HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb), and total blood volume (tHb) changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ANOVA compared differences between testing days and groups, and although large percentage changes in HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (20–30%), HHb (30–40%), and tHb (30–40%) were recorded, no significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in cerebral hemodynamics occurred between mTBI vs. CON during aerobic exercise testing on any day post-injury. Furthermore, there was a linear relationship between exercise intensity vs. cerebral hemodynamics during testing for each day (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.83–0.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These results demonstrate two novel findings: (1) mild-to-intense aerobic exercise testing can be performed safely as early as Day 2 post-concussion injury in a controlled laboratory environment; and (2) evidence-based objective measures such as cerebral hemodynamics can easily be collected using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor physiological changes during the first-week post-injury. This research has important implications for monitoring physiological recovery post-injury and establishing new rehabilitation guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Layered Control Architecture of Sleep and Arousal</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep and wakefulness are promoted not by a single neural pathway but via wake or sleep-promoting nodes distributed across layers of the brain. We equate each layer with a brain region in proposing a layered subsumption model for arousal based on a computational architecture. Beyond the brainstem the layers include the diencephalon (hypothalamus, thalamus), basal ganglia, and cortex. In light of existing empirical evidence, we propose that each layer have sleep and wake computations driven by similar high-level architecture and processing units. Specifically, an interconnected wake-promoting system is suggested as driving arousal in each brain layer with the processing converging to produce the features of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons largely project to and inhibit wake-promoting neurons. We propose a general pattern of caudal wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neurons having a strong effect on overall behavior. However, while rostral brain layers have less influence on sleep and wake, through descending projections, they can subsume the activity of caudal brain layers to promote arousal. The two models presented in this work will suggest computations for the layering and hierarchy. Through dynamic system theory several hypotheses are introduced for the interaction of controllers and systems that correspond to the different populations of neurons at each layer. The models will be drawn-upon to discuss future experiments to elucidate the structure of the hierarchy that exists among the sleep-arousal architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dose-Dependent Microglial and Astrocytic Responses Associated With Post-ischemic Neuroprotection After Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Sepsis-Like State in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preconditioning, which has repeatedly been examined in the past, the effects of post-ischemic LPS-induced sepsis, although clinically considerably more important, have not systemically been studied. We exposed mice to transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and examined the effects of intraperitoneal LPS (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) which was administered 24 h post-ischemia. Post-ischemic glial reactivity, neuronal survival and neurological outcome were differently modulated by the higher and the lower LPS dose. Although both doses promoted neuronal survival after 72 h, the underlying mechanisms were not similar. Mice receiving 1 mg/kg LPS exhibited transient hypothermia at 1 and 3 hours post sepsis (hps), followed by reduced focal neurological deficits at 24, 48 and 72 hps. The lower dose (0.1 mg/kg) did not induce hypothermia, but reduced microglia/macrophage activation with the appearance of an anti-inflammatory CD206 positive cell phenotype in the brain parenchyma. Together, our results indicate a novel, dose-dependent modulation of microglial cells that is intricately involved in brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Consciousness while under general anesthesia is a dreadful condition. Various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies have been developed, on the basis of empirical evidence, in order to identify this condition. However, certain electrophysiological phenomena, which seem strongly related with depth of anesthesia in some drugs, appear less consistent with those of other anesthetic drugs. There is a gap between the complexity of the phenomenon of consciousness and its behavioral manifestations, on the one hand, and the empirical nature of the reported electrophysiological markers, which are associated with it, on the other hand. In fact, such a gap might prevent us from progressing toward unified electrophysiological markers of consciousness while under anesthesia, which are applicable to all anesthetic drugs. We believe that there is a need to bridge this conceptual gap. Therefore, in this work, we will try to present a theoretical framework for such bridging. First, we suggest focusing on neuropsychological processes, which seem to have a clear role in the behavioral manifestations of consciousness while under anesthesia but seem, nevertheless, better defined than consciousness itself—such as perception and attention. Then, we suggest analyzing the effects of anesthesia upon these neuropsychological processes, as they are manifested in the EEG signal. Specifically, we will focus on the effects of anesthesia on event-related potentials (ERPs), which seem more easily associable with neuropsychological modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Unveiling the Synaptic Function and Structure Using Paired Recordings From Synaptically Coupled Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission between neurons is the basic mechanism for information processing in cortical microcircuits. To date, paired recording from synaptically coupled neurons is the most widely used method which allows a detailed functional characterization of unitary synaptic transmission at the cellular and synaptic level in combination with a structural characterization of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons at the light and electron microscopic level. In this review, we will summarize the many applications of paired recordings to investigate synaptic function and structure. Paired recordings have been used to study the detailed electrophysiological and anatomical properties of synaptically coupled cell pairs within a synaptic microcircuit; this is critical in order to understand the connectivity rules and dynamic properties of synaptic transmission. Paired recordings can also be adopted for quantal analysis of an identified synaptic connection and to study the regulation of synaptic transmission by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, the monoamines, neuropeptides, and adenosine etc. Taken together, paired recordings from synaptically coupled neurons will remain a very useful approach for a detailed characterization of synaptic transmission not only in the rodent brain but also that of other species including humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple TREX mRNA export complex subunits (e.g., THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, THOC7) have now been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. A subset of affected individuals’ has severe-profound ID, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Laminin-α2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. These mutations result in the complete absence or truncated expression of the laminin-α2 chain. The α2-chain is a major component of the laminin-211 and laminin-221 isoforms, the predominant laminin isoforms in healthy adult skeletal muscle. Mutations in this chain result in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration as early as neonatally. Laminin-211/221 is a ligand for muscle cell receptors integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. LAMA2 mutations are correlated with integrin-α7β1 disruption in skeletal muscle. In this review, we will summarize laminin-211/221 interactions with integrin-α7β1 in LAMA2-CMD muscle. Additionally, we will summarize recent developments using upregulation of laminin-111 in the sarcolemma of laminin-α2-deficient muscle. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action by which laminin-111 is able to prevent myopathy. These published studies demonstrate that laminin-111 is a disease modifier of LAMA2-CMD through different methods of delivery. Together, these studies show the potential for laminin-111 therapy as a novel paradigm for the treatment of LAMA2-CMD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multisensory Audiovisual Processing in Children With a Sensory Processing Disorder (I): Behavioral and Electrophysiological Indices Under Speeded Response Conditions</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Maladaptive reactivity to sensory inputs is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Little is known, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms. For some children, atypical sensory reactivity is the primary complaint, despite absence of another identifiable neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Studying Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) may well provide a window into the neuropathology of these symptoms. It has been proposed that a deficit in sensory integration underlies the SPD phenotype, but objective quantification of sensory integration is lacking. Here we used neural and behavioral measures of multisensory integration (MSI), which would be affected by impaired sensory integration and for which there are well accepted objective measures, to test whether failure to integrate across the senses is associated with atypical sensory reactivity in SPD. An autism group served to determine if observed differences were unique to SPD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We tested whether children aged 6–16 years with SPD (N = 14) integrate multisensory inputs differently from age-matched typically developing controls (TD: N = 54), or from children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD: N = 44). Participants performed a simple reaction-time task to the occurrence of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli presented in random order, while high-density recordings of electrical brain activity were made.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed large reductions in the extent to which they benefited from multisensory inputs compared to TDs. The ASD group showed similarly reduced response speeding to multisensory relative to unisensory inputs. Neural evidence for MSI was seen across all three groups, with the multisensory response differing from the sum of the unisensory responses. Post hoc tests suggested the possibility of enhanced MSI in SPD in timeframes consistent with cortical sensory registration (∼60 ms), followed by reduced MSI during a timeframe consistent with object formation (∼130 ms). The ASD group also showed reduced MSI in the later timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed reduction in their ability to benefit from redundant audio-visual inputs, similar to children with ASD. Neurophysiological recordings, on the other hand, showed that major indices of MSI were largely intact, although post hoc testing pointed to periods of potential differential processing. While these exploratory electrophysiological observations point to potential sensory-perceptual differences in multisensory processing in SPD, it remains equally plausible at this stage that later attentional processing differences may yet prove responsible for the multisensory behavioral deficits uncovered here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Examination of Structural Variations of the Circle of Willis by 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To explore structural variations of the circle of Willis using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA), and to compare this modality with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 819 consecutive patients suspected of having cerebral vascular diseases underwent 3D-TOF-MRA, followed by DSA within 2 weeks. We report accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 3D-TOF-MRA compared with DSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The sensitivity and specificity of combined analyses were 90–100 and 98–100%, respectively. The sensitivity and NPV of 3D-TOF-MRA images for A-, C-, D-, and H-types of circle of Willis anomalies were 100%. The specificity, accuracy and sensitivity were all 100% for detecting absence of the anterior communicating artery (ACOA). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for detecting F-type. The sensitivity and PPV of volume rendered (VR) images for the B-, E-, and G-types were relatively low (85.0, 86.2, and 73.8%, respectively). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was somewhat better (88.3, 89.2, and 81.8%, respectively). Combined analyses were better still (95.8, 96.1, and 99.0%, respectively). Specificity and NPVs were high (99.3–100%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: 3D-TOF-MRA compares well to DSA for evaluation of the structure of the circle of Willis. As 3D-TOF-MRA is a non-invasive modality, it may be preferred as a means to evaluate structural variations of the circle of Willis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregates of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Deciphering the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead from the alteration of Tau biology to neuronal death depends on the identification of Tau cellular partners. Combining genetic and transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila, we identified 77 new modulators of human Tau-induced toxicity, bringing to 301 the number of Tau genetic interactors identified so far in flies. Network analysis showed that 229 of these genetic modulators constitute a connected network. The addition of 77 new genes strengthened the network structure, increased the intergenic connectivity and brought up key hubs with high connectivities, namely Src64B/FYN, Src42A/FRK, kuz/ADAM10, heph/PTBP1, scrib/SCRIB, and Cam/CALM3. Interestingly, we established for the first time a genetic link between Tau-induced toxicity and ADAM10, a recognized Alzheimer Disease protective factor. In addition, our data support the importance of the presynaptic compartment in mediating Tau toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Diffeomorphic Registration With Intensity Transformation and Missing Data: Application to 3D Digital Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the problem of diffeomorphic image registration in the presence of differing image intensity profiles and sparsely sampled, missing, or damaged tissue. Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100-micron isotropic resolution to histology sections at 1 × 1 × 1,000-micron resolution with multiple varying stains. We pose registration as a penalized Bayesian estimation, exploiting statistical models of image formation where the target images are modeled as sparse and noisy observations of the atlas. In this injective setting, there is no assumption of symmetry between atlas and target. Cross-modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlas images may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to “background” or “artifact.” The two concepts are combined within an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We validate our method with simulated images, examples from neuropathology, and a standard benchmarking dataset. Finally, we apply it to reconstructing digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. By using a standard convolutional neural network to detect tau tangles in histology slices, this registration method enabled us to quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: An Automated Open-Source Workflow for Standards-Compliant Integration of Small Animal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale research integration is contingent on seamless access to data in standardized formats. Standards enable researchers to understand external experiment structures, pool results, and apply homogeneous preprocessing and analysis workflows. Particularly, they facilitate these features without the need for numerous potentially confounding compatibility add-ons. In small animal magnetic resonance imaging, an overwhelming proportion of data is acquired via the ParaVision software of the Bruker Corporation. The original data structure is predominantly transparent, but fundamentally incompatible with modern pipelines. Additionally, it sources metadata from free-field operator input, which diverges strongly between laboratories and researchers. In this article we present an open-source workflow which automatically converts and reposits data from the ParaVision structure into the widely supported and openly documented Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Complementing this workflow we also present operator guidelines for appropriate ParaVision data input, and a programmatic walk-through detailing how preexisting scans with uninterpretable metadata records can easily be made compliant after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multimodal Recognition of Emotions in Music and Facial Expressions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00032</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to investigate the neural processing of congruent vs. incongruent affective audiovisual information (facial expressions and music) by means of ERPs (Event Related Potentials) recordings. Stimuli were 200 infant faces displaying Happiness, Relaxation, Sadness, Distress and 32 piano musical pieces conveying the same emotional states (as specifically assessed). Music and faces were presented simultaneously, and paired so that in half cases they were emotionally congruent or incongruent. Twenty subjects were told to pay attention and respond to infrequent targets (adult neutral faces) while their EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The face-related N170 (160–180 ms) component was the earliest response affected by the emotional content of faces (particularly by distress), while visual P300 (250–450 ms) and auditory N400 (350–550 ms) responses were specifically modulated by the emotional content of both facial expressions and musical pieces. Face/music emotional incongruence elicited a wide N400 negativity indicating the detection of a mismatch in the expressed emotion. A swLORETA inverse solution applied to N400 (difference wave Incong. – Cong.), showed the crucial role of Inferior and Superior Temporal Gyri in the multimodal representation of emotional information extracted from faces and music. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (superior and medial, BA 10) was also strongly active, possibly supporting working memory. The data hints at a common system for representing emotional information derived by social cognition and music processing, including uncus and cuneus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Anodal tDCS on Arithmetic Performance and Electrophysiological Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Arithmetic abilities are among the most important school-taught skills and form the basis for higher mathematical competencies. At the same time, their acquisition and application can be challenging. Hence, there is broad interest in methods to improve arithmetic abilities. One promising method is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the present study, we compared two anodal tDCS protocols in their efficacy to improve arithmetic performance and working memory. In addition, we investigated stimulation-related electrophysiological changes. Three groups of participants solved arithmetic problems (additions and subtractions) and an n-back task before, during, and after receiving either frontal or parietal anodal tDCS (25 min; 1 mA) or sham stimulation. EEG was simultaneously recorded to assess stimulation effects on event-related (de-) synchronisation (ERS/ERD) in theta and alpha bands. Persons receiving frontal stimulation showed an acceleration of calculation speed in large subtractions from before to during and after stimulation. However, a comparable, but delayed (apparent only after stimulation) increase was also found in the sham stimulation group, while it was absent in the group receiving parietal stimulation. In additions and small subtractions as well as the working memory task, analyses showed no effects of stimulation. Results of ERS/ERD during large subtractions indicate changes in ERS/ERD patterns over time. In the left hemisphere there was a change from theta band ERD to ERS in all three groups, whereas a similar change in the right hemisphere was restricted to the sham group. Taken together, tDCS did not lead to a general improvement of arithmetic performance. However, results indicate that frontal stimulation accelerated training gains, while parietal stimulation halted them. The absence of general performance improvements, but acceleration of training effects might be a further indicator of the advantages of using tDCS as training or learning support over tDCS as a sole performance enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Three-Year Gait and Axial Outcomes of Bilateral STN and GPi Parkinson’s Disease Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00001</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To examine the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on gait and axial symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Available data have been inconsistent and mostly short-term regarding the effect of both brain targets on gait and axial symptoms. We aimed to identify potential target specific differences at 3-year follow-up from a large single-center experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrospectively reviewed short-term (6-month follow-up) and long-term (36-month follow-up) changes in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II and III total scores of 72 PD patients (53 with bilateral STN-DBS and 19 with bilateral GPi-DBS). An interdisciplinary team made target-specific decisions for each DBS patient. We analyzed changes in gait and axial subscores derived from UPDRS II and III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In both the STN- and GPi-DBS cohorts, we observed no significant differences in gait and axial UPDRS derived subscores in the off-med/on stimulation state at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline. On-med axial scores remained similar in the short-term but worsened in both groups (STN, 2.23 ± 3.43, p &amp;lt; 0.001; GPi, 2.53 ± 2.37, p &amp;lt; 0.01) in the long-term possibly due to disease progression. At long-term follow-up, the UPDRS III off-med/on stimulation scores worsened but were persistently improved from baseline in both groups (−9.07 ± 13.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The study showed that long-term both STN- and GPi-DBS had a similar effect on gait and axial symptoms in UPDRS derived subscores at 36-month follow-up despite potential baseline differences in criteria for selection of each target. More sophisticated measures of gait and balance beyond the categorical UPDRS score will be needed for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: IRSp53 Deletion in Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons and in Male and Female Mice Leads to Distinct Electrophysiological and Behavioral Phenotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IRSp53 is expressed in different cell types across different brain regions, although it remains unclear how IRSp53 deletion in different cell types affects brain functions and behaviors in mice. Here, we deleted IRSp53 in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mice and compared resulting phenotypes in males and females. IRSp53 deletion in excitatory neurons driven by Emx1 leads to strong social deficits and hyperactivity without affecting anxiety-like behavior, whereas IRSp53 deletion in inhibitory neurons driven by Viaat has minimal impacts on these behaviors in male mice. In female mice, excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion induces hyperactivity but moderate social deficits. Excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion in male mice induces an increased ratio of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E/I ratio) in layer V pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas the same mutation does not alter the E/I ratio in female neurons. These results suggest that IRSp53 deletion in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and in male and female mice has distinct impacts on behaviors and synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Metabolic Regulation of Glial Phenotypes: Implications in Neuron–Glia Interactions and Neurological Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glial cells are multifunctional, non-neuronal components of the central nervous system with diverse phenotypes that have gained much attention for their close involvement in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Glial phenotypes are primarily characterized by their structural and functional changes in response to various stimuli, which can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic. The reliance of neurons on glial cells is essential to fulfill the energy demands of the brain for its proper functioning. Moreover, the glial cells perform distinct functions to regulate their own metabolic activities, as well as work in close conjunction with neurons through various secreted signaling or guidance molecules, thereby constituting a complex network of neuron-glial interactions in health and disease. The emerging evidence suggests that, in disease conditions, the metabolic alterations in the glial cells can induce structural and functional changes together with neuronal dysfunction indicating the importance of neuron–glia interactions in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This review covers the recent developments that implicate the regulation of glial phenotypic changes and its consequences on neuron–glia interactions in neurological disorders. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and challenges of targeting glial metabolism as a strategy to treat neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Induces Dynamic Immune Cell Reactions in the Choroid Plexus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00018</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a specific form of hemorrhagic stroke that frequently causes intracranial hypertension. The choroid plexus (CP) of the brain ventricles is responsible for producing cerebrospinal fluid and forms the blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The aim of the current study was to determine whether SAH induces an immune cell reaction in the CP and whether the resulting increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) itself can lead to cellular changes in the CP. SAH was induced by injecting non-heparinized autologous blood to the cisterna magna. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) instead of blood was used to assess influence of increased ICP alone. SAH and ACSF animals were left to survive for 1, 3, and 7 days. SAH induced significantly increased numbers of M1 (ED1+, CCR7+) and M2 (ED2+, CD206+) macrophages as well as MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells (APC) compared to naïve and ACSF animals. Increased numbers of ED1+ macrophages and APC were found in the CP only 3 and 7 days after ACSF injection, while ED2+ macrophage number did not increase. CD3+ T cells were not found in any of the animals. Following SAH, proliferation activity in the CP gradually increased over time while ACSF application induced higher cellular proliferation only 1 and 3 days after injection. Our results show that SAH induces an immune reaction in the CP resulting in an increase in the number of several macrophage types in the epiplexus position. Moreover, we also found that increased ICP due to ACSF application induced both an immune reaction and increased proliferation of epiplexus cells in the CP. These findings indicate that increased ICP, and not just blood, contributes to cellular changes in the CP following SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that can contribute to the decline of the regenerative potential and function of tissues. The increased presence of senescent cells in different neurodegenerative diseases suggests the contribution of senescence in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Although several factors can induce senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and altered proteostasis have been shown to play a role in its onset. Oxidative stress contributes to accelerated aging and cognitive dysfunction stages affecting neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity, and survival. During later life stages, it is implicated in the progression of cognitive decline, synapse loss, and neuronal degeneration. Also, neuroinflammation exacerbates oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death through the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell proliferation and maturation. Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can induce DNA damage and alterations in DNA repair that, in turn, can exacerbate them. Another important feature associated with senescence is altered proteostasis. Because of the disruption in the function and balance of the proteome, senescence can modify the proper synthesis, folding, quality control, and degradation rate of proteins producing, in some diseases, misfolded proteins or aggregation of abnormal proteins. There is an extensive body of literature that associates cellular senescence with several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Down syndrome (DS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This review summarizes the evidence of the shared neuropathological events in these neurodegenerative diseases and the implication of cellular senescence in their onset or aggravation. Understanding the role that cellular senescence plays in them could help to develop new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids (mini-brains) consist of self-organized three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue which can be derived from reprogrammed adult cells and maintained for months in culture. These 3D structures manifest substantial potential for the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases and pave the way for personalized medicine. However, as these 3D brain models can express the whole human genetic complexity, it is critical to have access to isogenic mini-brains that only differ in specific and controlled genetic variables. Genetic engineering based on retroviral vectors is incompatible with the long-term modeling needed here and implies a risk of random integration while methods using CRISPR-Cas9 are still too complex to adapt to stem cells. We demonstrate in this study that our strategy which relies on an episomal plasmid vector derived from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) offers a simple and robust approach, avoiding the remaining caveats of mini-brain models. For this proof-of-concept, we used a normal tau protein with a fluorescent tag and a mutant genetic form (P301S) leading to Fronto-Temporal Dementia. Isogenic cell lines were obtained which were stable for more than 30 passages expressing either form. We show that the presence of the plasmid in the cells does not interfere with the mini-brain differentiation protocol and obtain the development of a pathologically relevant phenotype in cerebral organoids, with pathological hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. Such a simple and versatile genetic strategy opens up the full potential of human organoids to contribute to disease modeling, personalized medicine and testing of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Indoleamine-2,3-Dioxygenase Mediates Emotional Deficits by the Kynurenine/Tryptophan Pathway in the Ethanol Addiction/Withdrawal Mouse Model</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to investigate whether the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) pathway participates in the development of emotional deficits from ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The expression of proinflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IDO levels in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, and the neurotransmitters were tested by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Emotional deficits of mice were evaluated by behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were increased in mice after 4 weeks of alcohol exposure. As for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression, only the subtype IDO1 was found to increase at both mRNA level and protein level in all the tested brain regions of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. In behavioral tests, mice exposed to alcohol showed gradually declined memory function accompanied by anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Meanwhile, increased expression of KYN, decreased expression of 5-HT, and abnormal expression of 3-HK and KA were found in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. Interestingly, the IDO1 inhibitor, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT), reversed all above alterations induced by ethanol in mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested that the TRP/KYN pathway, medicated by IDO1, in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala, plays an important role in the development of emotional deficits caused by ethanol addiction and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: GABAA Receptor β2E155 Residue Located at the Agonist-Binding Site Is Involved in the Receptor Gating</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00002</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) play a crucial role in mediating inhibition in the adult brain. In spite of progress in describing (mainly) the static structures of this receptor, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation remain unclear. It is known that in the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the mutation of the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155 residue, at the orthosteric binding site, strongly impairs the receptor activation, but the molecular and kinetic mechanisms of this effect remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the impact of the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155C mutation on binding and gating of the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. To this end, we combined the macroscopic and single-channel analysis, the use of different agonists [GABA and muscimol (MSC)] and flurazepam (FLU) as a modulator. As expected, the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155C mutation caused a vast right shift of the dose–response (for GABA and MSC) and, additionally, dramatic changes in the time course of current responses, indicative of alterations in gating. Mutated receptors showed reduced maximum open probability and enhanced receptor spontaneous activity. Model simulations for macroscopic currents revealed that the primary effect of the mutation was the downregulation of the preactivation (flipping) rate. Experiments with MSC and FLU further confirmed a reduction in the preactivation rate. Our single-channel analysis revealed the mutation impact mainly on the second component in the shut times distributions. Based on model simulations, this finding further confirms that this mutation affects mostly the preactivation transition, supporting thus the macroscopic data. Altogether, we provide new evidence that the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155 residue is involved in both binding and gating (primarily preactivation).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Hippocampal Gamma Oscillations by Dopamine in Heterozygous Reeler Mice in vitro</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00586</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reelin haploinsufficient heterozygous reeler mice (HRM), an animal model of schizophrenia, have altered mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways and share similar neurochemical and behavioral properties with patients with schizophrenia. Dysfunctional neural circuitry with impaired gamma (γ) oscillation (30–80 Hz) has been implicated in abnormal cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, the function of neural circuitry in terms of γ oscillation and its modulation by dopamine (DA) has not been reported in HRM. In this study, first, we recorded γ oscillations in CA3 from wild-type mice (WTM) and HRM hippocampal slices, and we studied the effects of DA on γ oscillations. We found that there was no difference in γ power between WTM and HRM and that DA increased γ power of WTM but not HRM, suggesting that DA modulations of network oscillations in HRM are impaired. Second, we found that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 itself increased γ power and occluded DA-mediated enhancement of γ power in WTM but partially restored DA modulation of γ oscillations in HRM. Third, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream molecule of NMDAR, increased γ power and blocked the effects of DA on γ oscillation in WTM and had no significant effect on γ power but largely restored DA modulation of γ oscillations in HRM. Our results reveal that impaired DA function in HRM is associated with dysregulated NMDAR–PI3K signaling, a mechanism that may be relevant in the pathology of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Zebrafish Astroglial Morphology in the Olfactory Bulb Is Altered With Repetitive Peripheral Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00004</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Zebrafish do not possess the typical astrocytes that are found in mammalian systems. In some brain areas, this teleost has radial glia that appears to perform astrocyte-like functions, but these cells have not been described in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Mammalian astrocytes facilitate neuroplasticity and undergo astrogliosis after insult. The role of these cells in the zebrafish olfactory system after the damage has been poorly explored. This is important to examine because zebrafish have a high degree of neuroplasticity and the olfactory bulb is a brain area renowned for plasticity. The goal of this study was to explore the potential role of zebrafish astrocytes in the olfactory bulb damage response, with a goal to exploit the high level of regeneration in this system. We found that anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labels numerous processes in the zebrafish olfactory bulb that are concentrated in the nerve and glomerular layers (GL) and do not show radial glial-like morphology. We propose to term this astroglia, since their location and response to damage suggests that they are similar in function to the mammalian astrocyte. To induce repetitive peripheral damage to the olfactory organ, a wax plug was inserted into the nasal cavity of adult zebrafish every 12 h for up to 7 days; this crushes the olfactory organ and leads to degradation of olfactory sensory neuron axons that project to the olfactory bulb. After 1 day, we found a significant increase in astroglial labeling in the affected bulb when compared to the internal control bulb and astroglial branches appeared to increase in number and size. By the third day of plug insertions there was no significant difference in astroglial labeling between the affected bulb and the internal control bulb. These data lead us to believe that astrogliosis does occur in the presence of peripheral damage, but this process attenuates within 1 week and no glial scar is evident upon recovery from the damage. Further exploration of astrocytes in zebrafish, in particular this apparent attenuation of astrogliosis, has the potential to elucidate key differences in glial function between teleosts and mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Stereotaxic Diffusion Tensor Imaging White Matter Atlas for the in vivo Domestic Feline Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cat brain is a useful model for neuroscientific research and with the increasing use of advanced neuroimaging techniques there is a need for an open-source stereotaxic white matter brain atlas to accompany the cortical gray matter atlas, currently available. A stereotaxic white matter atlas would facilitate anatomic registration and segmentation of the white matter to aid in lesion localization or standardized regional analysis of specific regions of the white matter. In this article, we document the creation of a stereotaxic feline white matter atlas from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from a population of eight mesaticephalic felines. Deterministic tractography reconstructions were performed to create tract priors for the major white matter projections of Corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, uncinate, Corona Radiata (CR), Corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), and the cerebellar tracts. T1-weighted, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) population maps were generated. The volume, mean tract length and mean FA, MD, AD and RD values for each tract prior were documented. A structural connectome was then created using previously published cortical priors and the connectivity metrics for all cortical regions documented. The provided white matter atlas, diffusivity maps, tract priors and connectome will be a valuable resource for anatomical, pathological and translational neuroimaging research in the feline model. Multi-atlas population maps and segmentation priors are available at Cornell’s digital repository: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/58775.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Density of Perineuronal Nets Increases With Age in the Inferior Colliculus in the Fischer Brown Norway Rat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related hearing loss, one of the most frequently diagnosed disabilities in industrialized countries, may result from declining levels of GABA in the aging inferior colliculus (IC). However, the mechanisms of aging and subsequent disruptions of temporal processing in elderly hearing abilities are still being investigated. Perineuronal nets (PNs) are a specialized form of the extracellular matrix and have been linked to GABAergic neurotransmission and to the regulation of structural and synaptic plasticity. We sought to determine whether the density of PNs in the IC changes with age. We combined Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining with immunohistochemistry to glutamic acid decarboxylase in three age groups of Fischer Brown Norway (FBN) rats. The density of PNs on GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the three major subdivisions of the IC was quantified. Results first demonstrate that the density of PNs in the FBN IC increase with age. The greatest increases of PN density from young to old age occurred in the central IC (67% increase) and dorsal IC (117% increase). Second, in the young IC, PNs surround non-GABAergic and GABAergic cells with the majority of PNs surrounding the former. The increase of PNs with age in the IC occurred on both non-GABAergic and GABAergic populations. The average density of PN-surrounded non-GABAergic cells increased from 84.9 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 134.2 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. While the density of PN-surrounded GABAergic cells increased from 26 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 40.6 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. The causality is unclear, but increases in PN density in old age may play a role in altered auditory processing in the elderly, or may lead to further changes in IC plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Vital Functions Contribute to the Spread of Extracellular Fluids in the Brain: Comparison Between Life and Death</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00015</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vascular pulsations, contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells and breathing have been reported to foster movement and clearance of interstitial and cerebrospinal fluids from the brain. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of these vital functions. We compared the spread of an injected hydrophilic tracer (Fluoro-Emerald, a 10 kDa fluorescein-coupled dextran amine) in the brains of live anesthetized and sacrificed rats at 30 and 90 min after injection. To determine the overall pattern of distribution of tracers, we created 3D-reconstructions of the horizontal transections of the whole brain. Immunofluorescence staining with laminin and collagen IV was performed to determine the pattern of distribution of tracer in relation to the cerebrovascular basement membranes. We found that diffusion was widely restricted to the periventricular region in sacrificed rats with no spread to the contralateral hemisphere, while the bulk flow occurred along the vasculature and reached the surface and the contralateral hemisphere as soon as 30 min after injection in live anesthetized animals. The tracer appeared to be localized along the vascular basement membranes and along fiber tracts as reported previously. Thus, our data indicate that vital functions are essential for the remote movement of extracellular fluids within the cerebral parenchyma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Gray Matter Atrophy in Behavioral Variant Frontal Temporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00014</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00014</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is growing evidence supporting behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as extreme points of a disease spectrum. The aim of this study was to delineate the common and different patterns of gray matter atrophy associated with bvFTD and with ALS by pooling together the results of previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrieved VBM studies that investigated gray matter atrophy in bvFTD patients vs. controls and in ALS patients vs. controls. Stereotactic data were extracted from those studies and subsequently tested for convergence and differences using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). A behavioral analysis using the BrainMap database was performed to assess the functional roles of the regions affected by bvFTD and/or ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated a convergence of gray matter atrophy in the frontolimbic structures that involve the bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Comparing the pattern of GM atrophy in bvFTD and ALS patients revealed greater atrophy in the frontomedial cortex, bilateral caudate, left anterior insula, and right thalamus in those with bvFTD and a higher degree of atrophy in the right motor cortex of those with ALS. Behavioral analysis revealed that the pattern of the affected regions contributed to the dysfunction of emotional and cognitive processing in bvFTD patients and the dysfunction of motor execution in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results revealed a shared neural basis between bvFTD and ALS subjects, as well as a specific and distinct neural signature that underpinned the clinical manifestations of those two diseases. Those findings outlined the role of the frontomedial-caudate circuit in the development of bvFTD-like deficits in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Interaction of EphA4 With PDGFRβ Regulates Proliferation and Neuronal Differentiation of Neural Progenitor Cells in vitro and Promotes Neurogenesis in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have great potentials in cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), by promoting neurogenesis associated with hippocampal memory improvement. Ephrin receptors and angiogenic growth factor receptors have a marked impact on the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. Although ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) was shown to directly interact with platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), the functional effects of this interaction on neurogenesis in cultured NPCs and adult hippocampus have not yet been studied. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EphA4 directly interacted with PDGFRβ in NPCs under ligand stimulation. Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-platelet-derived growth factor BB (BB) significantly increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs, which was further augmented by combined treatment of Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-BB. We also found that ligand-dependent proliferation and neuronal differentiation were inhibited by the dominant-negative EphA4 mutant or a PDGFR inhibitor. Most importantly, injection of ephrin-A1 and/or PDGF-BB promoted hippocampal NPC proliferation in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, indicating that direct interaction of EphA4 with PDGFRβ plays a functional role on neurogenesis in vivo. Finally, studies in NPCs showed that the EphA4/PDGFRβ/FGFR1/FRS2α complex formed by ligand stimulation is involved in neurogenesis via ERK signaling. The present findings provided a novel insight into the functional role of direct interaction of EphA4 and PDGFRβ in neurogenesis, implicating its potential use for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Annals of Neurology TLR4 signaling in neurons enhances calcium‐permeable AMPAR currents and drives post‐traumatic epileptogenesis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53bcdd2a-3cb5-4ce1-a7af-507b4bddbfc1/ana25698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphic illustration of the effect of injury and early TLR4 antagonist treatment on early network excitability and the long‐term network state. The schematic neurons include TLR4 and AMPAR subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a two‐tone color‐coded network state topology where green indicates low‐normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (Inset on upper right). Note the correspondence between early excitability state (population response profile) and long‐term seizure susceptibility and the effects of pharmacological manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a major risk factor for acquired epilepsies and understanding the mechanisms underlying the early pathophysiology could yield viable therapeutic targets. Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here we examined the effect of innate immune receptor, toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and epileptogenesis after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice and in vivo electrophysiology and western blots were conducted in rats subject to fluid percussion brain injury or sham injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies identify that TLR4 signaling in neurons, augments dentate granule cell calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor (CP‐AMPAR) currents after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce post‐injury seizure susceptibility. Further, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post‐traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4‐dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4‐mediated increase in CP‐AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Longitudinal Neuroimaging over 30 Days: Temporal Characteristics of Migraine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25697?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although migraine is defined by the headache and headache‐associated symptoms, the true beginning of a migraine attack lies in the premonitory phase. To understand the generation of attacks, one needs to investigate the phase before headache starts. The premonitory phase of migraine is characterized by a well‐described complex of symptoms. Its duration, however, is not clearly defined, and there are no biomarkers to help define when this phase starts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate the duration of the premonitory phase in spontaneous human migraine attacks. Because migraine attacks are hardly predictable and thereby the premonitory phase is difficult to catch, we scanned 9 patients daily over a minimum period of 30 days using a well‐established paradigm for functional MRI of trigeminal nociception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven patients were included in the analysis, thus providing cumulative data of 27 spontaneous human migraine attacks including scans before, during, and after migraine pain as well as interictal scans. As a response to painful trigeminal stimulation, activation of the hypothalamus was present within the last 48 hours before headache onset but not earlier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using hypothalamic activation as a potential marker for the premonitory phase of migraine in this unique dataset, our data corroborated a duration of 48 hours for the premonitory phase of migraine. We suggest applying this time criterion in future studies when focusing on this phase of the migraine cycle. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Coffee Consumption and Risk of Stroke: A Mendelian Randomization Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25693?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25693?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between coffee intake and risk of stroke. However, evidence for this association is inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. To clarify this relationship, we adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of stroke and its subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) including 91,462 coffee consumers was used to identify instruments for coffee consumption. Summary‐level data for stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (IS), and IS subtypes were obtained from GWAS meta‐analyses conducted by the MEGASTROKE consortium. MR analyses were performed using the inverse‐variance‐weighted, weighted‐median, MR‐PRESSO (Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) test and MR‐Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using alternative instruments to test the robustness of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted coffee consumption (high vs infrequent/no) was not associated with risk of stroke. Similarly, among coffee consumers, MR analysis did not indicate causal associations between coffee consumption (cups/day) and risk of stroke. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found weak suggestive evidence for a potential protective effect of coffee consumption on risk of small vessel (SV)‐IS, although the association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that coffee consumption is not causally associated with risk of stroke or its subtypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible association between coffee intake and risk of SV‐IS, as well as its potential underlying mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Visual Dysfunction of the Superior Colliculus in De Novo Parkinsonian Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual hit hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) suggests that the brainstem is a convergent area for the propagation of pathological α‐synuclein from the periphery to the brain. Although brainstem structures are likely to be affected early in the course of the disease, detailed information regarding specific brainstem regions is lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate the function of the superior colliculus, a sensorimotor brainstem structure, in de novo PD patients compared to controls using brain functional magnetic imaging and visual stimulation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De novo PD patients and controls were recruited. PD subjects were imaged before and after starting PD medications. A recently developed functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol was used to stimulate and visualize the superior colliculus and 2 other visual structures: the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 22 PD patients, there was no modulation of the superior colliculus responses to the luminance contrasts compared to controls. This implies a hypersensitivity to low luminance contrast and abnormal rapid blood oxygenation level–dependent signal saturation to high luminance contrasts. The lateral geniculate nucleus was only modulated by 3 to 9% luminance contrasts compared to controls. No major differences were found in the primary visual cortex between both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that pathological superior colliculus visual responses in de novo PD patients are present early in the course of the disease. Changes in imaging the superior colliculus could play an important role as a preclinical biomarker of the disease. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While spatiotemporal proximity is necessary for synapse formation, it remains unclear to what extent the underlying positional strategies are sufficient to ensure synapse formation between the right partners. Many neurons readily form synapses with wrong partners if they find themselves at the wrong place or time. Minimally, restricting spatiotemporal proximity can prevent incorrect synapses. Maximally, restricting encounters in time and space could be sufficient to ensure correct partnerships between neurons that can form synapses promiscuously. In this review we explore recent findings on positional strategies during developmental growth that contribute to precise outcomes in brain wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;i&gt;GBA1,&lt;/i&gt; the gene mutated in Gaucher disease, are a common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease, although the penetrance is low. We performed [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa PET studies of 57 homozygous and heterozygous &lt;i&gt;GBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers (15 with parkinsonism) and 98 controls looking for early indications of dopamine loss using voxel‐wise analyses to identify group differences in striatal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa uptake (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). Forty‐eight subjects were followed longitudinally. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal comparisons of K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;‐change found significant effects of Parkinson disease. However, at baseline and over time, striatal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa uptake in mutation carriers without parkinsonism did not significantly differ from controls.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Locally-Induced CaMKII Translocation Requires Nucleotide Binding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is a molecule involved in several cell processes including plasticity related to learning and memory. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors results in translocation of CaMKII to synapses. However, there are at least two distinct mechanisms by which glutamate-dependent CaMKII translocation occurs: one well-studied process resulting from whole-cell glutamate stimulation and one resulting from brief, local glutamate application. Unlike the relatively fast CaMKII translocation seen following whole-cell glutamate delivery (seconds), local application results in CaMKII translocation that occurs gradually within 6–10 min. This locally-induced translocation of CaMKII requires L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel co-activation but does not rely on GluN2B receptor subunit expression, unlike translocation following whole-cell application of glutamate. The current study examined if nucleotide binding is necessary for locally-induced CaMKII translocation, similar to CaMKII translocation resulting from whole-cell glutamate application. Three different mechanisms of inhibition were employed: staurosporine (ATP inhibitor), CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor and expression of the K42M mutation. Locally-induced CaMKII translocation was moderately suppressed in the presence of either the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) or the CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor. However, expression of the catalytically dead K42M mutation that prevents ATP-binding to CaMKII, significantly inhibited locally-induced translocation. Thus, CaMKII translocation following brief, local glutamate application requires nucleotide binding, providing support for future research into the molecular mechanisms of this distinct form of CaMKII translocation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Plasticity in the Brainstem: Prenatal and Postnatal Experience Can Alter Laterodorsal Tegmental (LDT) Structure and Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00003</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem has traditionally been considered an area of the brain with autonomous control of mostly homeostatic functions such as heart rate, respiration, and the sleep and wakefulness state, which would preclude the necessity to exhibit the high degree of synaptic or cellular mechanisms of plasticity typical of regions of the brain responsible for flexible, executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. The perception that the brainstem does not share the same degree of flexibility to alter synaptic strength and/or wiring within local circuits makes intuitive sense, as it is not easy to understand how “soft wiring” would be an advantage when considering the importance of faithful and consistent performance of the homeostatic, autonomic functions that are controlled by the brainstem. However, many of the molecular and cellular requirements which underlie strengthening of synapses seen in brain regions involved in higher-level processing are present in brainstem nuclei, and recent research suggest that the view of the brainstem as “hard wired,” with rigid and static connectivity and with unchanging synaptic strength, is outdated. In fact, information from studies within the last decades, including work conducted in our group, leads us to propose that the brainstem can dynamically alter synaptic proteins, and change synaptic connections in response to prenatal or postnatal stimuli, and this would likely alter functionality and output. This article reviews recent research that has provided information resulting in our revision of the view of the brainstem as static and non-changing by using as example recent information gleaned from a brainstem pontine nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). The LDT has demonstrated mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, and plasticity has been exhibited in the postnatal LDT following exposure to drugs of abuse. Further, exposure of the brain during gestation to drugs of abuse results in alterations in development of signaling pathways in the LDT. As the LDT provides a high degree of innervation of mesoaccumbal and mesocortical circuits involved in salience, as well as thalamocortical circuits involved in control of arousal and orientation, changes in synaptic strength would be expected to alter output, which would significantly impact behavioral state, motivated behavior and directed attention. Further, alterations in developmental trajectory within the LDT following prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse would be expected to impact on later life expression of motivation and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The P/Q-type Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channel regulates neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and many central synapses. CACNA1A encodes the pore-containing α&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels. In humans, de novo CACNA1A mutations result in a wide spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular, and movement disorders, such as familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), as well as a more recently discovered class of more severe disorders, which are characterized by ataxia, hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive/developmental delay. Heterologous expression of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels has allowed for an understanding of the consequences of CACNA1A missense mutations on channel function. In contrast, a mechanistic understanding of how specific CACNA1A mutations lead in vivo to the resultant phenotypes is lacking. In this review, we present the zebrafish as a model to both study in vivo mechanisms of CACNA1A mutations that result in synaptic and behavioral defects and to screen for effective drug therapies to combat these and other Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channelopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to evaluate a set of lab-based behavioral video tracking (VT), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking (ET) measures for use in clinical trials with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within the larger organizational structure of the ABC-CT, the Data Acquisition and Analytic Core (DAAC) oversees the standardization of VT, EEG, and ET data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. This includes designing and documenting data acquisition and analytic protocols and manuals; facilitating site training in acquisition; data acquisition quality control (QC); derivation and validation of dependent variables (DVs); and analytic deliverables including preparation of data for submission to the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). To oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition, processing, and analytics, we developed standard operating procedures that reflect the logistical needs of multi-site research, and the need for well-articulated, transparent processes that can be implemented in future clinical trials. This report details the methodology of the ABC-CT related to acquisition and QC in our Feasibility and Main Study phases. Based on our acquisition metrics from a preplanned interim analysis, we report high levels of acquisition success utilizing VT, EEG, and ET experiments in a relatively large sample of children with ASD and typical development (TD), with data acquired across multiple sites and use of a manualized training and acquisition protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive imaging methods have become essential tools for understanding the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide information about the anatomy, microstructure, and function of the brain and spinal cord in vivo non-invasively. However, MRI is limited by its spatial resolution and signal specificity. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, it is crucial to validate MRI with an array of ancillary ex vivo imaging techniques. These techniques include histological methods, such as light and electron microscopy (EM), which can provide specific information on the tissue structure in healthy and diseased brain and spinal cord, at cellular and subcellular level. However, these conventional histological techniques are intrinsically two-dimensional (2D) and, as a result of sectioning, lack volumetric information of the tissue. This limitation can be overcome with genuine three-dimensional (3D) imaging approaches of the tissue. 3D highly resolved information of the CNS achievable by means of other imaging techniques can complement and improve the interpretation of MRI measurements. In this article, we provide an overview of different 3D imaging techniques that can be used to validate MRI. As an example, we introduce an approach of how to combine diffusion MRI and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography (SXRPCT) data. Our approach paves the way for a new multiscale assessment of the CNS allowing to validate and to improve our understanding of in vivo imaging (such as MRI).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Systematic Evaluation of Image Tiling Adverse Effects on Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural network (CNN) models obtain state of the art performance on image classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Limitations in computer hardware, most notably memory size in deep learning accelerator cards, prevent relatively large images, such as those from medical and satellite imaging, from being processed as a whole in their original resolution. A fully convolutional topology, such as U-Net, is typically trained on down-sampled images and inferred on images of their original size and resolution, by simply dividing the larger image into smaller (typically overlapping) tiles, making predictions on these tiles, and stitching them back together as the prediction for the whole image. In this study, we show that this tiling technique combined with translationally-invariant nature of CNNs causes small, but relevant differences during inference that can be detrimental in the performance of the model. Here we quantify these variations in both medical (i.e., BraTS) and non-medical (i.e., satellite) images and show that training a 2D U-Net model on the whole image substantially improves the overall model performance. Finally, we compare 2D and 3D semantic segmentation models to show that providing CNN models with a wider context of the image in all three dimensions leads to more accurate and consistent predictions. Our results suggest that tiling the input to CNN models—while perhaps necessary to overcome the memory limitations in computer hardware—may lead to undesirable and unpredictable errors in the model's output that can only be adequately mitigated by increasing the input of the model to the largest possible tile size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Cynomolgus Monkeys With Spontaneous Type-2-Diabetes-Mellitus-Like Pathology Develop Alpha-Synuclein Alterations Reminiscent of Prodromal Parkinson’s Disease and Related Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Available evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a non-genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD and DM have shared similarities in pathogenetic mechanisms, including age, environmental factors, inflammatory reaction, and protein aggregation, etc. α-Synuclein is the primary protein component in the protein inclusions in PD, while islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates to form amyloid structures in β cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Pancreatic and cerebral functions, pancreas and brain α-synuclein deposition as well as striatal alterations, were assessed in spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys and age-matched normal monkeys. We demonstrated increased accumulation, aggregation, and phosphorylation of α-synuclein, and IAPP in the pancreatic islets of spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys, compared to the age-matched normal subjects. Double immunofluorescence analyses showed complete overlap between α-synuclein and IAPP in the pancreatic islets. In addition, in T2DM monkeys’ brain, we observed concomitantly increased accumulation and phosphorylation of α-synuclein in the cortex, pre-commissural putamen and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which interestingly showed high correlation with levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Our data indicates the close association between IAPP and α-synuclein and the potential link between T2DM and PD, which implies that T2DM may facilitate PD disease onset and progress by interfering with the pathological protein aggregation both in the pancreatic islets and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Monitoring Depth of Anesthesia Based on Hybrid Features and Recurrent Neural Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain valuable information about the different physiological states of the brain, with a variety of linear and nonlinear features that can be used to investigate brain activity. Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) with EEG is an ongoing challenge in anesthesia research. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to combine the hybrid features of EEG to monitor the DoA. The EEG signals were preprocessed using filtering, etc., and then more than ten features including sample entropy, permutation entropy, spectra, and alpha-ratio were extracted from the EEG signal. We then integrated the optional features such as permutation entropy and alpha-ratio to extract the essential structure and learn the most efficient temporal model for monitoring the DoA. Compared with using a single feature, the proposed model could accurately estimate the depth of anesthesia with higher prediction probability (P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;). Experimental results evaluated on the datasets demonstrated that our proposed method provided better performance than the methods using permutation entropy, alpha-ratio, LSTM, and other traditional indices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Motion Biomarkers Showing Maximum Contrast Between Healthy Subjects and Parkinson's Disease Patients Treated With Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus. A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01450</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01450</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Classic motion abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity, are well-covered by standard clinical assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, PD includes motor abnormalities beyond the symptoms and signs as measured by UPDRS, such as the lack of anticipatory adjustments or compromised movement smoothness, which are difficult to assess clinically. Moreover, PD may entail motor abnormalities not yet known. All these abnormalities are quantifiable via motion capture and may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this pilot study, we attempted to identify motion features revealing maximum contrast between healthy subjects and PD patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) switched off and on as the first step to develop biomarkers for detecting and monitoring PD patients' motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed 3D gait analysis in 7 out of 26 PD patients with DBS switched off and on, and in 25 healthy control subjects. We computed feature values for each stride, related to 22 body segments, four time derivatives, left–right mean vs. difference, and mean vs. variance across stride time. We then ranked the feature values according to their distinguishing power between PD patients and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The foot and lower leg segments proved better in classifying motor anomalies than any other segment. Higher degrees of time derivatives were superior to lower degrees (jerk &amp;gt; acceleration &amp;gt; velocity &amp;gt; displacement). The averaged movements across left and right demonstrated greater distinguishing power than left–right asymmetries. The variability of motion was superior to motion's absolute values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This small pilot study identified the variability of a smoothness measure, i.e., jerk of the foot, as the optimal signal to separate healthy subjects' from PD patients' gait. This biomarker is invisible to clinicians' naked eye and is therefore not included in current motor assessments such as the UPDRS. We therefore recommend that more extensive investigations be conducted to identify the most powerful biomarkers to characterize motor abnormalities in PD. Future studies may challenge the composition of traditional assessments such as the UPDRS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Robust Model System for Retinal Hypoxia: Live Imaging of Calcium Dynamics and Gene Expression Studies in Primary Human Mixed Retinal Culture</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The detailed mechanisms underlying oxidative stress that leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in retinal vascular conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity etc., remain largely unexplored mainly due to a lack of suitable disease models that can simulate the inherent neuron–glia interactions in human retina. Specifically, establishment of a mixed retinal culture (MRC) containing both neuron and glial cell types remains a challenge due to different conditions required for their optimal growth and differentiation. Here, we establish a novel primary MRC model system containing neurons, astrocytes, Müller glia, and microglia from human donor retina that can be used to study the neuromodulatory effects of glial cells under the stress. The cell characterization based on immunostaining with individual cell type–specific markers and their presence in close vicinity to each other further underscores their utility for studying their cross talk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of an in vitro model obtained from human donor retina containing four major cell types. Next, we induce hypoxic stress to MRC to investigate if hypoxia activated neuroglia modulates altered gene expression for inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic markers and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients by live cell imaging. Further, we performed k-means clustering of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to identify the modification of clustering pattern in stressed condition. Finally, we provide the evidence that the altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient correlates to differential expression of genes shown to be involved in neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration under the hypoxic conditions as seen earlier in human cell lines and animal models of diabetic retinopathy. The major features of the hypoxic conditions in the proposed human MRC model included: increase in microglia activity, chemokine and cytokine expression, and percentage of cells having higher amplitude and frequency of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Thus, the proposed experimental system can potentially serve as an ideal in vitro model for studying the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in the retina and identifying newer drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Optimizing Computer–Brain Interface Parameters for Non-invasive Brain-to-Brain Interface</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A non-invasive, brain-to-brain interface (BBI) requires precision neuromodulation and high temporal resolution as well as portability to increase accessibility. A BBI is a combination of the brain–computer interface (BCI) and the computer–brain interface (CBI). The optimization of BCI parameters has been extensively researched, but CBI has not. Parameters taken from the BCI and CBI literature were used to simulate a two-class medical monitoring BBI system under a wide range of conditions. BBI function was assessed using the information transfer rate (ITR), measured in bits per trial and bits per minute. The BBI ITR was a function of classifier accuracy, window update rate, system latency, stimulation failure rate (SFR), and timeout threshold. The BCI parameters, including window length, update rate, and classifier accuracy, were kept constant to investigate the effects of varying the CBI parameters, including system latency, SFR, and timeout threshold. Based on passively monitoring BCI parameters, a base ITR of 1 bit/trial was used. The optimal latency was found to be 100 ms or less, with a threshold no more than twice its value. With the optimal latency and timeout parameters, the system was able to maintain near-maximum efficiency, even with a 25% SFR. When the CBI and BCI parameters are compared, the CBI’s system latency and timeout threshold should be reflected in the BCI’s update rate. This would maximize the number of trials, even at a high SFR. These findings suggested that a higher number of trials per minute optimizes the ITR of a non-invasive BBI. The delays innate to each BCI protocol and CBI stimulation method must also be accounted for. The high latencies in each are the primary constraints of non-invasive BBI for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;At present, the diagnosis of brain disease is mainly based on the self-reported symptoms and clinical signs of the patient, which can easily lead to psychiatrists' bias. The purpose of this study is to develop a brain network clustering model to accurately identify brain diseases based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the absence of clinical information. We use cosine similarity and sub-network kernels to measure attribute similarity and structure similarity, respectively. By integrating the structure similarity and attribute similarity into one matrix, spectral clustering is used to achieve brain network clustering. Finally, we evaluate this method on three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Bipolar disorder patients, and Schizophrenia. The performance of methods is evaluated by measuring clustering consistency. Clustering consistency is similar to clustering accuracy, which is used to evaluate the consistency between the clustering labels and clinical diagnostic labels of the subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve clustering performance, with a consistency of 60.6% for Alzheimer's disease, with a consistency of 100% for Schizophrenia, with a consistency of 100% for Bipolar disorder patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Curiosity-Based Learning Method for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00007</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming computation on neuron level and complex optimization limit their real-time application. Curiosity has shown great performance in brain learning, which helps biological brains grasp new knowledge efficiently and actively. Inspired by this leaning mechanism, we propose a curiosity-based SNN (CBSNN) model, which contains four main learning processes. Firstly, the network is trained with biologically plausible plasticity principles to get the novelty estimations of all samples in only one epoch; secondly, the CBSNN begins to repeatedly learn the samples whose novelty estimations exceed the novelty threshold and dynamically update the novelty estimations of samples according to the learning results in five epochs; thirdly, in order to avoid the overfitting of the novel samples and forgetting of the learned samples, CBSNN retrains all samples in one epoch; finally, step two and step three are periodically taken until network convergence. Compared with the state-of-the-art Voltage-driven Plasticity-centric SNN (VPSNN) under standard architecture, our model achieves a higher accuracy of 98.55% with only 54.95% of its computation cost on the MNIST hand-written digit recognition dataset. Similar conclusion can also be found out in other datasets, i.e., Iris, NETtalk, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively. More experiments and analysis further prove that such curiosity-based learning theory is helpful in improving the efficiency of SNNs. As far as we know, this is the first practical combination of the curiosity mechanism and SNN, and these improvements will make the realistic application of SNNs possible on more specific tasks within the von Neumann framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Demystifying Brain Tumor Segmentation Networks: Interpretability and Uncertainty Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Cell-Type-Specific Whole-Brain Direct Inputs to the Anterior and Posterior Piriform Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The piriform cortex (PC) is a key brain area involved in both processing and coding of olfactory information. It is implicated in various brain disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism. The PC consists of the anterior (APC) and posterior (PPC) parts, which are different anatomically and functionally. However, the direct input networks to specific neuronal populations within the APC and PPC remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped the whole-brain direct inputs to the two major neuronal populations, the excitatory glutamatergic principal neurons and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons within the APC and PPC using the rabies virus (RV)-mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing system. We found that for both types of neurons, APC and PPC share some similarities in input networks, with dominant inputs originating from the olfactory region (OLF), followed by the cortical subplate (CTXsp), isocortex, cerebral nuclei (CNU), hippocampal formation (HPF) and interbrain (IB), whereas the midbrain (MB) and hindbrain (HB) were rarely labeled. However, APC and PPC also show distinct features in their input distribution patterns. For both types of neurons, the input proportion from the OLF to the APC was higher than that to the PPC; while the PPC received higher proportions of inputs from the HPF and CNU than the APC did. Overall, our results revealed the direct input networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of different PC subareas, providing a structural basis to analyze the diverse PC functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the endogenous immune cells of the brain and act as sensor of infection and pathologic injury to the brain, leading to a rapid plastic process of activation that culminates in the endocytosis and phagocytosis of damaged tissue. Microglia cells are the most plastic cells in the brain. Microglia isolation from their environment as well as culturing them in the presence of serum alter their function and lead to a rapid loss of their signature gene expression. Previous studies have identified pivotal factors allowing microglia culture in the absence of serum. Here, we have further characterized the function, expression of markers, metabolic status and response to pro and anti-inflammatory stimulus of microglia isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting and cultured in a chemically defined medium. We have compared this new method with previous traditional protocols of culturing microglia that use high concentrations of serum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: TTX-Resistant Sodium Channels Functionally Separate Silent From Polymodal C-nociceptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00013</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pronounced activity-dependent slowing of conduction has been used to characterize mechano-insensitive, “silent” nociceptors and might be due to high expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and could, therefore, be characterized by their tetrodotoxin-resistance (TTX-r). Nociceptor-class specific differences in action potential characteristics were studied by: (i) in vitro calcium imaging in single porcine nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive neurites; (ii) in vivo extracellular recordings in functionally identified porcine silent nociceptors; and (iii) in vitro patch-clamp recordings from murine silent nociceptors, genetically defined by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 (CHRNA3) expression. Porcine TTX-r neurites (n = 26) in vitro had more than twice as high calcium transients per action potential as compared to TTX-s neurites (n = 18). In pig skin, silent nociceptors (n = 14) characterized by pronounced activity-dependent slowing of conduction were found to be TTX-r, whereas polymodal nociceptors were TTX-s (n = 12) and had only moderate slowing. Mechano-insensitive cold nociceptors were also TTX-r but showed less activity-dependent slowing than polymodal nociceptors. Action potentials in murine silent nociceptors differed from putative polymodal nociceptors by longer duration and higher peak amplitudes. Longer duration AP in silent murine nociceptors linked to increased sodium load would be compatible with a pronounced activity-dependent slowing in pig silent nociceptors and longer AP durations could be in line with increased calcium transients per action potential observed in vitro in TTX-resistant NGF responsive porcine neurites. Even though there is no direct link between slowing and TTX-resistant channels, the results indicate that axons of silent nociceptors not only differ in their receptive but also in their axonal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With a lipid-rich environment and elevated oxygen consumption, the central nervous system (CNS) is subject to intricate regulation by lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs). Investigations into oxidative damage and chronic LDE generation in neural disorders have spurred the development of tools that can detect and catalog the gamut of LDE-adducted proteins. Despite these advances, deconstructing the precise consequences of individual protein-specific LDE modifications remained largely impossible until recently. In this perspective, we first overview emerging toolsets that can decode electrophile-signaling events in a protein/context-specific manner, and how the accumulating mechanistic insights brought about by these tools have begun to offer new means to modulate pathways relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS). By surveying the latest data surrounding the blockbuster MS drug dimethyl fumarate that functions through LDE-signaling-like mechanisms, we further provide a vision for how chemical biology tools probing electrophile signaling may be leveraged toward novel interventions in CNS disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Prototypical Template for Rapid Face Detection Is Embedded in the Monkey Superior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00005</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human babies respond preferentially to faces or face-like images. It has been proposed that an innate and rapid face detection system is present at birth before the cortical visual pathway is developed in many species, including primates. However, in primates, the visual area responsible for this process is yet to be unraveled. We hypothesized that the superior colliculus (SC) that receives direct and indirect retinal visual inputs may serve as an innate rapid face-detection system in primates. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responsiveness of monkey SC neurons to first-order information of faces required for face detection (basic spatial layout of facial features including eyes, nose, and mouth), by analyzing neuronal responses to line drawing images of: (1) face-like patterns with contours and properly placed facial features; (2) non-face patterns including face contours only; and (3) nonface random patterns with contours and randomly placed face features. Here, we show that SC neurons respond stronger and faster to upright and inverted face-like patterns compared to the responses to nonface patterns, regardless of contrast polarity and contour shapes. Furthermore, SC neurons with central receptive fields (RFs) were more selective to face-like patterns. In addition, the population activity of SC neurons with central RFs can discriminate face-like patterns from nonface patterns as early as 50 ms after the stimulus onset. Our results provide strong neurophysiological evidence for the involvement of the primate SC in face detection and suggest the existence of a broadly tuned template for face detection in the subcortical visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulator (TESCoN) Improves Symptoms of Overactive Bladder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation is a therapeutic technique that is well-established in the treatment of idiopathic Lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction such as overactive bladder (OAB). We have recently developed a novel neuromodulation approach, Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulation (TESCoN) and demonstrated its acute effects on LUT dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI) during urodynamic studies. We found that TESCoN can promote urinary storage and induce urinary voiding when delivered during urodynamic studies. The objective of this study was to determine whether TESCoN can retrain the spinal neural networks to induce chronic improvement in the LUT, such that positive changes can persist even in the absence of stimulation. In addition, we wished to examine the effect of TESCoN on LUT dysfunction due to multiple pathologies. To achieve this objective, 14 patients [SCI = 5, stroke = 5, multiple sclerosis (MS) = 3, and idiopathic OAB (iOAB) = 1] completed 24 sessions of TESCoN over the course of 8 weeks. Patients completed urodynamic studies before and after undergoing TESCoN therapy. Additionally, each subject completed a voiding diary and the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score questionnaire before and after receiving TESCoN therapy. We found that TESCoN led to decreased detrusor overactivity, improved continence, and enhanced LUT sensation across the different pathologies underlying LUT dysfunction. This study serves as a pilot in preparation for a rigorous randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effect of TESCoN on LUT function in neurogenic and non-neurogenic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;New And Noteworthy&lt;p&gt;Non-Surgical modality to reduce incidence of urinary incontinence and improve neurogenic bladder symptom scores (NBSS) in individuals with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lysophosphatidic Acid Induces Apoptosis of PC12 Cells Through LPA1 Receptor/LPA2 Receptor/MAPK Signaling Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid is a small extracellular signaling molecule, which is elevated in pathological conditions such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). LPA regulates the survival of neurons in various diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPA-induced neuronal death remain unclear. Here we report that LPA activates LPA1 and LPA2 receptors, and the downstream MAPK pathway to induce the apoptosis of PC12 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction. LPA elicits the activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways, decreases the expression of Bcl2, promotes the translocation of Bax, and enhances the activation of caspase-3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. This process can be blocked by LPA1 receptor antagonist and LPA2 receptor antagonist and MAPK pathway inhibitors. Our results indicate that LPA1 receptor, LPA2 receptor and MAPK pathway play a critical role in LPA-induced neuronal injury. LPA receptors and MAPK pathways may be novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke and TBI, where excessive LPA signaling exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry has enabled neuroscientists to easily measure targeted brain activity patterns in awake, freely behaving animal. A focus of this technique is to identify functionally-relevant changes in activity around particular environmental and/or behavioral events, i.e., event-related activity transients (ERT). A simple and popular approach to identifying ERT is to summarize peri-event signal [e.g., area under the curve (AUC), peak activity, etc.,] and perform standard analyses on this summary statistic. We highlight the various issues with this approach and overview straightforward alternatives: waveform confidence intervals (CIs) and permutation tests. We introduce the rationale behind these approaches, describe the results of Monte Carlo simulations evaluating their effectiveness at controlling Type I and Type II error rates, and offer some recommendations for selecting appropriate analysis strategies for fiber photometry experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Hierarchical Clustering Analyses of Plasma Proteins in Subjects With Cardiovascular Risk Factors Identify Informative Subsets Based on Differential Levels of Angiogenic and Inflammatory Biomarkers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning approach for identifying informative natural clusters of observations. HCA is performed by calculating a pairwise dissimilarity matrix and then clustering similar observations until all observations are grouped within a cluster. Verifying the empirical clusters produced by HCA is complex and not well studied in biomedical applications. Here, we demonstrate the comparability of a novel HCA technique with one that was used in previous biomedical applications while applying both techniques to plasma angiogenic (FGF, FLT, PIGF, Tie-2, VEGF, VEGF-D) and inflammatory (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, IL8, TNFα) protein data to identify informative subsets of individuals. Study subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (MCI-CVD). Through comparison of the two HCA techniques, we were able to identify subsets of individuals, based on differences in VEGF (p &amp;lt; 0.001), MMP1 (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and IL8 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) levels. These profiles provide novel insights into angiogenic and inflammatory pathologies that may contribute to VCID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Cortical and Striatal Circuits in Huntington’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that typically manifests in midlife with motor, cognitive, and/or psychiatric symptoms. The disease is caused by a CAG triplet expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene and leads to a severe neurodegeneration in the striatum and cortex. Classical electrophysiological studies in genetic HD mouse models provided important insights into the disbalance of excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs, as well as progressive disconnection between the cortex and striatum. However, the involvement of local cortical and striatal microcircuits still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the progress in understanding HD-related impairments in the cortical and basal ganglia circuits, and outline new opportunities that have opened with the development of modern circuit analysis methods. In particular, in vivo imaging studies in mouse HD models have demonstrated early structural and functional disturbances within the cortical network, and optogenetic manipulations of striatal cell types have started uncovering the causal roles of certain neuronal populations in disease pathogenesis. In addition, the important contribution of astrocytes to HD-related circuit defects has recently been recognized. In parallel, unbiased systems biology studies are providing insights into the possible molecular underpinnings of these functional defects at the level of synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. With these approaches, we can now reach a deeper understanding of circuit-based HD mechanisms, which will be crucial for the development of effective and targeted therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Multi-Level Clustering of Dynamic Directional Brain Network Patterns and Their Behavioral Relevance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) obtained from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been shown to provide novel insights into brain function which may be obscured by static functional connectivity (SFC). Further, DFC, and by implication how different brain regions may engage or disengage with each other over time, has been shown to be behaviorally relevant and more predictive than SFC of behavioral performance and/or diagnostic status. DFC is not a directional entity and may capture neural synchronization. However, directional interactions between different brain regions is another putative mechanism by which neural populations communicate. Accordingly, static effective connectivity (SEC) has been explored as a means of characterizing such directional interactions. But investigation of its dynamic counterpart, i.e., dynamic effective connectivity (DEC), is still in its infancy. Of particular note are methodological insufficiencies in identifying DEC configurations that are reproducible across time and subjects as well as a lack of understanding of the behavioral relevance of DEC obtained from resting state fMRI. In order to address these issues, we employed a dynamic multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model to estimate DEC. The method was first validated using simulations and then applied to resting state fMRI data obtained in-house (N = 21), wherein we performed dynamic clustering of DEC matrices across multiple levels [using adaptive evolutionary clustering (AEC)] – spatial location, time, and subjects. We observed a small number of directional brain network configurations alternating between each other over time in a quasi-stable manner akin to brain microstates. The dominant and consistent DEC network patterns involved several regions including inferior and mid temporal cortex, motor and parietal cortex, occipital cortex, as well as part of frontal cortex. The functional relevance of these DEC states were determined using meta-analyses and pertained mainly to memory and emotion, but also involved execution and language. Finally, a larger cohort of resting-state fMRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 232, Q1–Q3 release) was used to demonstrate that metrics derived from DEC can explain larger variance in 70 behaviors across different domains (alertness, cognition, emotion, and personality traits) compared to SEC in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Designs and Adult Functions of Cortical Maps in Multiple Modalities: Perception, Attention, Navigation, Numbers, Streaming, Speech, and Cognition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article unifies neural modeling results that illustrate several basic design principles and mechanisms that are used by advanced brains to develop cortical maps with multiple psychological functions. One principle concerns how brains use a strip map that simultaneously enables one feature to be represented throughout its extent, as well as an ordered array of another feature at different positions of the strip. Strip maps include circuits to represent ocular dominance and orientation columns, place-value numbers, auditory streams, speaker-normalized speech, and cognitive working memories that can code repeated items. A second principle concerns how feature detectors for multiple functions develop in topographic maps, including maps for optic flow navigation, reinforcement learning, motion perception, and category learning at multiple organizational levels. A third principle concerns how brains exploit a spatial gradient of cells that respond at an ordered sequence of different rates. Such a rate gradient is found along the dorsoventral axis of the entorhinal cortex, whose lateral branch controls the development of time cells, and whose medial branch controls the development of grid cells. Populations of time cells can be used to learn how to adaptively time behaviors for which a time interval of hundreds of milliseconds, or several seconds, must be bridged, as occurs during trace conditioning. Populations of grid cells can be used to learn hippocampal place cells that represent the large spaces in which animals navigate. A fourth principle concerns how and why all neocortical circuits are organized into layers, and how functionally distinct columns develop in these circuits to enable map development. A final principle concerns the role of Adaptive Resonance Theory top-down matching and attentional circuits in the dynamic stabilization of early development and adult learning. Cortical maps are modeled in visual, auditory, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate stimulus onset timing is critical to almost all behavioral research. Auditory, visual, or manual response time stimulus onsets are typically sent through wires to various machines that record data such as: eye gaze positions, electroencephalography, stereo electroencephalography, and electrocorticography. These stimulus onsets are collated and analyzed according to experimental condition. If there is variability in the temporal accuracy of the delivery of these onsets to external systems, the quality of the resulting data and scientific analyses will degrade. Here, we describe an approximately 200 dollar Arduino based system and associated open-source codebase that achieved a maximum of 4 microseconds of delay from the inputs to the outputs while electrically opto-isolating the connected external systems. Using an oscilloscope, the device is configurable for the different environmental conditions particular to each laboratory (e.g., light sensor type, screen type, speaker type, stimulus type, temperature, etc). This low-cost open-source project delivered electrically isolated digital stimulus onset Transistor-Transistor Logic triggers with an input/output delay of 4 μs, and was successfully tested with seven different external systems that record eye and neurological data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Conserved Genoarchitecture of the Basal Hypothalamus in Zebrafish Embryos</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Analyses of genoarchitecture recently stimulated substantial revisions of anatomical models for the developing hypothalamus in mammalian and other vertebrate systems. The prosomeric model proposes the hypothalamus to be derived from the secondary prosencephalon, and to consist of alar and basal regions. The basal hypothalamus can further be subdivided into tuberal and mamillary regions, each with distinct subregions. Albeit being a widely used model system for neurodevelopmental studies, no detailed genoarchitectural maps exist for the zebrafish (Danio rerio) hypothalamus. Here, we compare expression domains of zebrafish genes, including arxa, shha, otpa, isl1, lhx5, nkx2.1, nkx2.2a, pax6, and dlx5a, the orthologs of which delimit specific subregions within the murine basal hypothalamus. We develop the highly conserved brain-specific homeobox (bsx) gene as a novel marker for genoarchitectural analysis of hypothalamic regions. Our comparison of gene expression patterns reveals that the genoarchitecture of the basal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos 48 hours post fertilization is highly similar to mouse embryos at E13.5. We found the tuberal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos to be relatively large and to comprise previously ill-defined regions around the posterior hypothalamic recess. The mamillary hypothalamus is smaller and concentrates to rather medial areas in proximity to the anterior end of the neural tube floor plate. Within the basal hypothalamus we identified longitudinal and transverse tuberal and mamillary subregions topologically equivalent to those previously described in other vertebrates. However, the hypothalamic diencephalic boundary region and the posterior tuberculum still provide a challenge. We applied the updated prosomeric model to the developing zebrafish hypothalamus to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Accordingly, we applied the mammalian nomenclature of hypothalamic organization to zebrafish and propose it to replace some controversial previous nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is the application of subthreshold, sinusoidal current to modulate ongoing brain rhythms related to sensory, motor and cognitive processes. Electrophysiological studies suggested that the effect of tACS applied at an alpha frequency (8–12 Hz) was state-dependent. The effects of tACS, that is, an increase in parieto-occipital electroencephalography (EEG) alpha power and magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coherence, was only observed when the eyes were open (low alpha power) and not when the eyes were closed (high alpha power). This state-dependency of the effects of alpha tACS might extend to the aging brain characterized by general slowing and decrease in spectral power of the alpha rhythm. We additionally hypothesized that tACS will influence the motor cortex, which is involved in motor skill learning and consolidation. A group of young and old healthy adults performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their right hand before and after the tACS stimulation. Each participant underwent three sessions of stimulation: sham, stimulation applied at the individual participant’s alpha peak frequency or individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF; α-tACS) and stimulation with iAPF plus 2 Hz (α2-tACS) to the left motor cortex for 10 min (1.5 mA). We measured the effect of stimulation on general motor skill (GMS) and sequence-specific skill (SS) consolidation. We found that α-tACS and α2-tACS improved GMS and SS consolidation in the old group. In contrast, α-tACS minimally improved GMS consolidation but impaired SS consolidation in the young group. On the other hand, α2-tACS was detrimental to the consolidation of both skills in the young group. Our results suggest that individuals with aberrant alpha rhythm such as the elderly could benefit more from tACS stimulation, whereas for young healthy individuals with intact alpha rhythm the stimulation could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Electroacupuncture Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment by Inhibiting the JNK Signaling Pathway in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) has become popular for its adjustable strength and frequency and easy quantification in the clinic and has demonstrated therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism remains unknown. Abnormally activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been closely related to the pathological process of AD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EA on cognitive impairment and the role of the JNK signaling pathway in AD model amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice. The memory and learning ability of each group was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to measure the expression of APP, JNK, phosphorylated (P-)JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7, c-Jun and caspase-3 in hippocampal tissue samples in APP/PS1 mice after EA intervention. Obvious cognitive deficits were observed in the AD model APP/PS1 mice in the MWM test and were associated with JNK signaling pathway activation and APP upregulation. Four weeks of EA significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairments and inhibited JNK signaling pathway activation and APP upregulation. Taken together, the findings demonstrated that EA can reverse cognitive deficits and substantially lower the burden of APP in AD model APP/PS1 mice, at least partially through inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway and regulating apoptosis signals. Therefore, EA may offer an effective alternative therapeutic approach for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is a problem that impacts a significant proportion of the adult population. Cochlear hair cell (HC) loss due to loud noise, chemotherapy and aging is the major underlying cause. A significant proportion of these individuals are dissatisfied with available treatment options which include hearing aids and cochlear implants. An alternative approach to restore hearing would be to regenerate HCs. Such therapy would require a recapitulation of the complex architecture of the organ of Corti, necessitating regeneration of both mature HCs and supporting cells (SCs). Transcriptional profiles of the mature cell types in the cochlea are necessary to can provide a metric for eventual regeneration therapies. To assist in this effort, we sought to provide the first single-cell characterization of the adult cochlear SC transcriptome. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-purified adult cochlear SCs from the Lfng&lt;sup&gt;EGFP&lt;/sup&gt; adult mouse, in which SCs express GFP. We demonstrate that adult cochlear SCs are transcriptionally distinct from their perinatal counterparts. We establish cell-type-specific adult cochlear SC transcriptome profiles, and we validate these expression profiles through a combination of both fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization co-localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of adult cochlear SCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of these profiles to the adult human cochlea through immunofluorescent human temporal bone histopathology. Finally, we demonstrate cell cycle regulator expression in adult SCs and perform pathway analyses to identify potential mechanisms for facilitating mitotic regeneration (cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventually regeneration) in the adult mammalian cochlea. Our findings demonstrate the importance of characterizing mature as opposed to perinatal SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Association of Hypomorphic P2X7 Receptor Genotype With Age</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main risk factors for brain diseases is aging. Recent studies have shown that aging is a progressive degenerative process associated with chronic low-level inflammation. The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important role in inflammation and has been associated with different brain (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) or other age-related (osteoporosis, arthritis, cancer) diseases. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P2RX7 gene have been identified, including the loss-of-function 1513A&amp;gt;C and 1405A&amp;gt;G SNPs, and the gain-of-function 489C&amp;gt;T and 1068G&amp;gt;A SNPs. We carried out a literature analysis to verify an association between P2RX7 SNPs’ frequency and age. In 34 worldwide eligible studies (11.858 subjects) no correlation between 1513CC genotype frequency and age emerged. On the contrary, analysis of European Caucasian cohorts (7.241 subjects) showed a significant increase in 1513CC frequency with age (P = 0.027). In agreement with these findings, analysis of two publicly available datasets, including USA Caucasian cohorts, unveiled an increased frequency of 1513CC and 489CC genotypes with age (P = 0.0055 and P = 0.0019, respectively). Thus, hypomorphic P2RX7 genotypes may be positively selected with age in European and North American Caucasian populations. We hypothesize that Caucasian individuals bearing an anti-inflammatory P2X7R phenotype and living in high-income countries may have a longer life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Complement System in Brain Architecture and Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00023</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current evidence indicates that certain immune molecules such as components of the complement system are directly involved in neurobiological processes related to brain development, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration, synaptic remodeling, and response to prenatal or early postnatal brain insults. Consequently, complement system dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in disorders of neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Rett syndrome. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal relationship between impaired complement regulation and these disorders varies depending on the disease involved. Also, it is still unclear to what extent altered complement expression plays a role in these disorders through inflammation-independent or -dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in specific complement components have been implicated in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder. The aims of this review are to discuss the current knowledge on the roles of the complement system in sculpting brain architecture and function during normal development as well as after specific inflammatory insults, such as maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy, and to evaluate the existing evidence associating aberrant complement with developmental brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Blebbistatin Inhibits Neomycin-Induced Apoptosis in Hair Cell-Like HEI-OC-1 Cells and in Cochlear Hair Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging, noise, and ototoxic drug-induced hair cell (HC) loss are the major causes of sensorineural hearing loss. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are commonly used in the clinic, but these often have ototoxic side effects due to the accumulation of oxygen-free radicals and the subsequent induction of HC apoptosis. Blebbistatin is a myosin II inhibitor that regulates microtubule assembly and myosin–actin interactions, and most research has focused on its ability to modulate cardiac or urinary bladder contractility. By regulating the cytoskeletal structure and reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), blebbistatin can prevent apoptosis in many different types of cells. However, there are no reports on the effect of blebbistatin in HC apoptosis. In this study, we found that the presence of blebbistatin significantly inhibited neomycin-induced apoptosis in HC-like HEI-OC-1 cells. We also found that blebbistatin treatment significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased ROS accumulation, and inhibited pro-apoptotic gene expression in both HC-like HEI-OC-1 cells and explant-cultured cochlear HCs after neomycin exposure. Meanwhile, blebbistatin can protect the synaptic connections between HCs and cochlear spiral ganglion neurons. This study showed that blebbistatin could maintain mitochondrial function and reduce the ROS level and thus could maintain the viability of HCs after neomycin exposure and the neural function in the inner ear, suggesting that blebbistatin has potential clinic application in protecting against ototoxic drug-induced HC loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Cytoarchitectonic Characterization and Functional Decoding of Four New Areas in the Human Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00002</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive concept of the biological basis of reward, social and emotional behavior, and language requires a deeper understanding of the microstructure and connectivity of the underlying brain regions. Such understanding could provide deeper insights into their role in functional networks, and form the anatomical basis of the functional segregation of this region as shown in recent in vivo imaging studies. Here, we investigated the cytoarchitecture of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) in serial histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains by image analysis and a statistically reproducible approach to detect borders between cortical areas. Profiles of the volume fraction of cell bodies were therefore extracted from digitized histological images, describing laminar changes from the layer I/layer II boundary to the white matter. As a result, four new areas, Fo4–7, were identified. Area Fo4 was mainly found in the anterior orbital gyrus (AOG), Fo5 anteriorly in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), Fo6 in the lateral orbital gyrus (LOG), and Fo7 in the lateral orbital sulcus. Areas differed in cortical thickness, abundance and size of pyramidal cells in layer III and degree of granularity in layer IV. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to quantify cytoarchitectonic differences between them. The 3D-reconstructed areas were transformed into the single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), where probabilistic maps and a maximum probability map (MPM) were calculated as part of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas. These maps served as reference data to study the functional properties of the areas using the BrainMap database. The type of behavioral tasks that activated them was analyzed to get first insights of co-activation patterns of the lateral OFC and its contribution to cognitive networks. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) showed that functional decoding revealed activation in gustatory perception in Fo4; reward and somesthetic perception in Fo5; semantic processing and pain perception in Fo6; and emotional processing and covert reading in Fo7. Together with existing maps of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas, the new maps can now be used as an open-source reference for neuroimaging studies, allowing to further decode brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Revealing a Novel Landscape of the Association Between Blood Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of a Case-Control Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00370</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00370</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Blood lipid profiles have been ambiguously reported as biomarkers of AD in recent years. This study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between blood lipid levels and AD in later-life and to explore the effectiveness and reliability of blood lipid profiles as biomarkers of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Database searching was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Medline. This study was designed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) software was adopted to perform meta-analysis evaluating the standard mean difference (SMD) with its 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 5,286 participants were enrolled from 27 case–control studies in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that total cholesterol (TC) level was significantly associated with AD in late-life (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.32], P = 0.03), especially in the subgroup under 70 years old (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.79], P = 0.01) and the subgroup of Western population (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.04, 0.53], P = 0.02). In the subgroup under 70 years old, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (SMD = −0.50, 95% CI: [−0.76, −0.25], P = 0.0001) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: [0.02, 1.16], P = 0.04) in the AD group were significantly lower and higher than in the control group, respectively. In the subgroup with a sample size larger than 100 subjects, the LDL-C level was significantly higher in AD patients than in the control elderly group (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.56], P = 0.02). There was no significant association between triglyceride (TG) levels and AD in later-life (SMD = −0.00, 95% CI: [−0.12, 0.12], P = 1.00).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: TC can be a new predictive biomarker of AD or cognitive decline in later-life. Increased TC levels are found to be associated with an elevated risk of AD. Decreased HDL-C levels and increased LDL-C levels may relate to an elevated risk of AD in subjects aged 60–70. Further comprehensive researches will be necessary in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Richard H. Masland––Dick to all who knew him––died on December 13, 2019, from cancer, four years after his initial diagnosis. During this interval, while enduring major fluctuations in health, Dick managed to start and complete an approachable and reflective book, We Know It When We See It: What the Neurobiology of Vision Tells Us About How We Think (March 2020). We are gladdened, though not surprised, that his wife, Jean, reports, “Dick was truly amazing the way he faced his illness, never showing signs of depression or anger but soldiering on with a positive attitude toward life.”</description>

The mechanisms underlying the formation of gastrointestinal neurons are beginning to be elucidated; those that keep them plastic over an organism’s lifetime remain to be explored. Here, we review the effects of microbiota, nutrients, sex and ageing on the morphology and function of gastrointestinal innervation in mammals, and discuss how this plasticity shapes gut-brain crosstalk and whole-body physiology. We also highlight insights gained by nascent studies of the enteric innervation of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438819301394-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as MDC1A, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the alpha2 chain of Laminin-211. Loss of this protein interrupts the connection between the muscle cell and its extracellular environment and results in an aggressive, congenital-onset muscular dystrophy characterized by severe hypotonia, lack of independent ambulation, and early mortality driven by respiratory complications and/or failure to thrive. Of the pathomechanisms of MDC1A, the earliest and most prominent is widespread and rampant fibrosis. Here, we will discuss some of the key drivers of fibrosis including TGF-beta and renin–angiotensin system signaling and consequences of these pathways including myofibroblast transdifferentiation and matrix remodeling. We will also highlight some of the differences in fibrogenesis in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Finally, we will connect the key signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of MDC1A to the current status of the therapeutic approaches that have been tested in the preclinical models of MDC1A to treat fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Brain Structural Plasticity: From Adult Neurogenesis to Immature Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain structural plasticity is an extraordinary tool that allows the mature brain to adapt to environmental changes, to learn, to repair itself after lesions or disease, and to slow aging. A long history of neuroscience research led to fascinating discoveries of different types of plasticity, involving changes in the genetically determined structure of nervous tissue, up to the ultimate dream of neuronal replacement: a stem cell-driven “adult neurogenesis” (AN). Yet, this road does not seem a straight one, since mutable dogmas, conflicting results and conflicting interpretations continue to warm the field. As a result, after more than 10,000 papers published on AN, we still do not know its time course, rate or features with respect to other kinds of structural plasticity in our brain. The solution does not appear to be behind the next curve, as differences among mammals reveal a very complex landscape that cannot be easily understood from rodents models alone. By considering evolutionary aspects, some pitfalls in the interpretation of cell markers, and a novel population of undifferentiated cells that are not newly generated [immature neurons (INs)], we address some conflicting results and controversies in order to find the right road forward. We suggest that considering plasticity in a comparative framework might help assemble the evolutionary, anatomical and functional pieces of a very complex biological process with extraordinary translational potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy syndrome (HPHA) and hemidystonia-hemiatrophy syndrome (HDHA) are rare movement disorders composed of hemidystonia or hemiparkinsonism that present with unilateral limb, face, trunk, or cerebral hemiatrophy and mostly occur following head trauma or postanoxic events. However, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of these conditions. In our case series, we present three HPHA patients and one HDHA patient who underwent detailed neuropsychological, radiological, motor, and non-motor functional assessments with a mean follow-up of 2 years. We followed two patients who showed differences in their progression for more than 2 years: one barely progressed with no treatment, and the other exhibited levodopa-induce dyskinesia (LID) and definitive progression while receiving multiple adjunctive therapies. In addition, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in one HPHA patient who showed bilaterally symmetrical uptake of FDG with no significant increase or decrease in the cerebral hemispheres, including the striatum, but exhibited a significant reduction in the uptake of 18F-DOPA in the contralateral posterior striatum. In this study, we followed HPHA patients who showed different disease courses to explore the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of HPHA and HDHA and illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Acute Treatment With Gleevec Does Not Promote Early Vascular Recovery Following Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Adult Male Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains one of the most debilitating types of stroke and is characterized by a sudden bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel. ICH often results in high mortality and in survivors, permanent disability. Most studies have focused on neuroprotective strategies designed to minimize secondary consequences and prevent further pathology. Lacking is an understanding of how ICH acutely affects cerebrovascular components and their response to therapeutic interventions. We hypothesized that ICH alters cortical vessel complexity in the parenchyma adjacent to site of the initial vascular disruption and that vascular abnormalities would be mitigated by administration of the PDGFR inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Briefly, ICH was induced in male adult rats by injection of collagenase into basal ganglia, followed by Gleevec administration (60 mg/kg) 1 h after injury. Rats were then perfused using vessel painting methodology (Salehi et al., 2018b) to stain whole brain vascular networks at 1 day post-ICH. Axial and coronal wide field fluorescence microscopy was performed. Analyses for vascular features were undertaken and fractal analysis for vascular complexity. Data were collected from four groups of rats: Sham + Vehicle; Sham + Gleevec; ICH + Vehicle; ICH + Gleevec. Microscopy revealed that cortical vessels in both ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres exhibited significantly reduced density and branching by 22 and 34%, respectively. Fractal measures confirmed reduced complexity as well. Gleevec treatment further reduced vascular parameters, including reductions in vessel density in tissues adjacent to the ICH. The reductions in brain wide vascular networks after Gleevec in the current study after ICH is contrasted by previous reports of improved behavioral outcomes and decreased lCH lesion volumes Reductions in the vascular network after Gleevec may be involved in long-term repair mechanisms by pruning injured vessels to ultimately promote new vessel growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Benign Regulation of the Astrocytic Phospholipase A2-Arachidonic Acid Pathway: The Underlying Mechanism of the Beneficial Effects of Manual Acupuncture on CBF</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01354</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01354</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The astrocytic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-arachidonic acid (AA) pathway is crucial in understanding the reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) prior to cognitive deterioration. In complementary and alternative medicine, manual acupuncture (MA) is used as one of the most important therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The beneficial effects of MA on CBF were reported in our previous study. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of MA on the astrocytic PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway in SAMP8 mice hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;SAMP8 mice were divided into the SAMP8 control (Pc) group, the SAMP8 MA (Pm) group and the SAMP8 donepezil (Pd) group. SAMR1 mice were used as the SAMRl control (Rc) group. Mice in the Pd group were treated with donepezil hydrochloride at 0.65 μg/g. In the Pm group, MA was applied at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) for 20 min. The above treatments were administered once a day for 26 consecutive days. The Morris water maze was applied to assess spatial learning and memory. Immunofluorescence staining, western blot and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to investigate the expression of related proteins and measure the contents of the metabolic intermediates of the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with that in the Rc group, the escape latency in the Pc group significantly increased (p &amp;lt; 0.01); whereas, the platform crossover number and percentage of time and swimming distance in the platform quadrant decreased (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The hippocampal expression of PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, cyclooxygenase-1, cytochrome P450 proteins 2C23 and the levels of AA, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids of the Pc group was drastically higher than that in the Rc group (p &amp;lt; 0.01). These changes were reversed by MA and donepezil (p &amp;lt; 0.01 or p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MA can effectively improve the learning and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice and has a negative regulatory effect on the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway. We propose that the increase of the arterial tone, which is induced by the inhibition of vasodilatory pathway, may be a reason for the beneficial effect of MA on CBF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Magia: Robust Automated Image Processing and Kinetic Modeling Toolbox for PET Neuroinformatics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Processing of positron emission tomography (PET) data typically involves manual work, causing inter-operator variance. Here we introduce the Magia toolbox that enables processing of brain PET data with minimal user intervention. We investigated the accuracy of Magia with four tracers: [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM, and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB. We used data from 30 control subjects for each tracer. Five operators manually delineated reference regions for each subject. The data were processed using Magia using the manually and automatically generated reference regions. We first assessed inter-operator variance resulting from the manual delineation of reference regions. We then compared the differences between the manually and automatically produced reference regions and the subsequently obtained binding potentials and standardized-uptake-value-ratios. The results show that manually produced reference regions can be remarkably different from each other, leading to substantial differences also in outcome measures. While the Magia-derived reference regions were anatomically different from the manual ones, Magia produced outcome measures highly consistent with the average of the manually obtained estimates. For [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB there was no bias, while for [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM Magia produced 3–5% higher binding potentials. Based on these results and considering the high inter-operator variance of the manual method, we conclude that Magia can be reliably used to process brain PET data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling the Effect of Temperature on Membrane Response of Light Stimulation in Optogenetically-Targeted Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00005</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is revolutionizing Neuroscience, but an often neglected effect of light stimulation of the brain is the generation of heat. In extreme cases, light-generated heat kills neurons, but mild temperature changes alter neuronal function. To date, most in vivo experiments rely on light stimulation of neural tissue using fiber-coupled lasers of various wavelengths. Brain tissue is irradiated with high light power that can be deleterious to neuronal function. Furthermore, absorbed light generates heat that can lead to permanent tissue damage and affect neuronal excitability. Thus, light alone can generate effects in neuronal function that are unrelated to the genuine “optogenetic effect.” In this work, we perform a theoretical analysis to investigate the effects of heat transfer in rodent brain tissue for standard optogenetic protocols. More precisely, we first use the Kubelka-Munk model for light propagation in brain tissue to observe the absorption phenomenon. Then, we model the optothermal effect considering the common laser wavelengths (473 and 593 nm) used in optogenetic experiments approaching the time/space numerical solution of Pennes' bio-heat equation with the Finite Element Method. Finally, we then modeled channelrhodopsin-2 in a single and spontaneous-firing neuron to explore the effect of heat in light stimulated neurons. We found that, at commonly used light intensities, laser radiation considerably increases the temperature in the surrounding tissue. This effect alters action potential size and shape and causes an increase in spontaneous firing frequency in a neuron model. However, the shortening of activation time constants generated by heat in the single firing neuron model produces action potential failures in response to light stimulation. We also found changes in the power spectrum density and a reduction in the time required for synchronization in an interneuron network model of gamma oscillations. Our findings indicate that light stimulation with intensities used in optogenetic experiments may affect neuronal function not only by direct excitation of light sensitive ion channels and/or pumps but also by generating heat. This approach serves as a guide to design optogenetic experiments that minimize the role of tissue heating in the experimental outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Regulation of CSF and Brain Tissue Sodium Levels by the Blood-CSF and Blood-Brain Barriers During Migraine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00004</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue sodium levels increase during migraine. However, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of sodium homeostasis disturbance in the brain during the onset and propagation of migraine. Exploring the cause of sodium dysregulation in the brain is important, since correction of the altered sodium homeostasis could potentially treat migraine. Under the hypothesis that disturbances in sodium transport mechanisms at the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and/or the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are the underlying cause of the elevated CSF and brain tissue sodium levels during migraines, we developed a mechanistic, differential equation model of a rat's brain to compare the significance of the BCSFB and the BBB in controlling CSF and brain tissue sodium levels. The model includes the ventricular system, subarachnoid space, brain tissue and blood. Sodium transport from blood to CSF across the BCSFB, and from blood to brain tissue across the BBB were modeled by influx permeability coefficients P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, while sodium movement from CSF into blood across the BCSFB, and from brain tissue to blood across the BBB were modeled by efflux permeability coefficients PBCSFB′ and PBBB′, respectively. We then performed a global sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the ventricular CSF, subarachnoid CSF and brain tissue sodium concentrations to pathophysiological variations in P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, PBCSFB′ and PBBB′. Our results show that the ventricular CSF sodium concentration is highly influenced by perturbations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a much lesser extent by perturbations of PBCSFB′. Brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium concentrations are more sensitive to pathophysiological variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′ than variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBCSFB′ within 30 min of the onset of the perturbations. However, P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; is the most sensitive model parameter, followed by P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′, in controlling brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium levels within 3 h of the perturbation onset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to explore the relationship between 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) within the southern Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 420 participants, consisting of 215 AD patients and 205 sex- and age-matched controls, were recruited. The SNaPshot technique and polymer chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the 18 SNPs. Combined with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and age at onset, we performed an association analysis between these SNPs and AD susceptibility. Furthermore, we analyzed SNP-associated gene expression using the expression quantitative trait loci analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our study found that rs17125924 of FERMT2 was associated with the risk of developing AD in the dominant (P = 0.022, odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–2.32) and overdominant (P = 0.005, OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.18–2.61) models. Moreover, compared with APOE ε4 non-carriers, the frequency of the G-allele at rs17125924 was significantly higher among AD patients in APOE ε4 allele carriers (P = 0.029). The rs9271058 of HLA-DRB1 (dominant, overdominant, and additive models), rs9473117 of CD2AP (dominant and additive models), and rs73223431 of PTK2B (dominant, overdominant, and additive models) were associated with early onset AD (EOAD). Using the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and Braineac database, we found a significant association between rs9271058 genotypes and HLA-DRB1 expression levels, while the CC genotype at rs9473117 and the TT genotype of rs73223431 increased CD2AP and PTK2B gene expression, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study identifies the G-allele at rs17125924 as a risk factor for developing AD, especially in APOE ε4 carriers. In addition, we found that rs9271058 of HLA-DRB1, rs9473117 of CD2AP, and rs73223431 of PTK2B were associated with EOAD. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A bidirectional crosstalk between peripheral players of immunity and the central nervous system (CNS) exists. Hence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is emerging as a participant mechanism of dysregulated peripheral–CNS interplay, promoting diseases. Here, we examine the implication of BBB damage in neurodegeneration, linking it to peripheral brain-directed autoantibodies and gut–brain axis mechanisms. As BBB breakdown is a factor contributing to, or even anticipating, neuronal dysfunction(s), we here identify contemporary pharmacological strategies that could be exploited to repair the BBB in disease conditions. Developing neurovascular, add on, therapeutic strategies may lead to a more efficacious pre-clinical to clinical transition with the goal of curbing the progression of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hemianopia is characterized by blindness in one half of the visual field and is a common consequence of stroke and unilateral injury to the visual cortex. There are few effective rehabilitative strategies that can relieve it. Using the cat as an animal model of hemianopia, we found that blindness induced by lesions targeting all contiguous areas of the visual cortex could be rapidly reversed by a non-invasive, multisensory (auditory-visual) exposure procedure even while animals were anesthetized. Surprisingly few trials were required to reinstate vision in the previously blind hemisphere. That rehabilitation was possible under anesthesia indicates that the visuomotor behaviors commonly believed to be essential are not required for this recovery, nor are factors such as attention, motivation, reward, or the various other cognitive features that are generally thought to facilitate neuro-rehabilitative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pathological ATPergic Signaling in Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mood disorders, major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD), have a high lifetime prevalence in the human population and accordingly generate huge costs for health care. Efficient, rapidly acting, and side-effect-free pharmaceuticals are hitherto not available, and therefore, the identification of new therapeutic targets is an imperative task for (pre)clinical research. Such a target may be the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), which is localized in the central nervous system (CNS) at microglial and neuroglial cells mediating neuroinflammation. MD and BD are due to neuroinflammation caused in the first line by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from the microglia. IL-1β in turn induces the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and in consequence the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, which together with a plethora of further cytokines/chemokines lead to mood disorders. A number of biochemical/molecular biological measurements including the use of P2X7R- or IL-1β-deficient mice confirmed this chain of events. More recent studies showed that a decrease in the astrocytic release of ATP in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is a major cause of mood disorders. It is an attractive hypothesis that compensatory increases in P2X7Rs in these areas of the brain are the immediate actuators of MD and BD. Hence, blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7R antagonists may be promising therapeutic tools to improve depressive disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Oligomers Are Promising Targets for Drug Development in the Treatment of Proteinopathies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no effective treatment of proteinopathies, as well as their diagnosis in the early stages of the disease until the first clinical symptoms appear. The proposed model of fibrillation of the Aβ peptide and its fragments not only describes molecular rearrangements, but also offers models of processes that occur during the formation of amyloid aggregates. Since this model is also characteristic of other proteins and peptides, a new potential target for drug development in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other proteinopathies is proposed on the basis of this model. In our opinion, it is oligomers that are promising targets for innovative developments in the treatment of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Mongolian Warm Acupuncture on iNOS/NO and Inflammatory Cytokines in the Hippocampus of Chronic Fatigue Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (iNOS/NO) signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced fatigue. Studies have found that Mongolian warm acupuncture (WA) could alleviate exercise-induced fatigue. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Mongolian WA on iNOS/NO signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokines in a chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue rat model. Animals were randomly divided into Control group, Ctrl + WA group, Model group, and Model + WA group. The body weight, exhaustive swimming time test, and Morris water maze test were performed before and after the chronic exhaustive swimming. The serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and iNOS were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and iNOS in the hippocampus were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, the protein expression of iNOS in the hippocampus was measured by western blot, and the NO productions in the serum and hippocampus were detected by Griess reaction system. Chronic exhaustive exercise significantly reduced the body weight and exhaustive swimming time, and induced impairment in learning and memory, and which were reversed by WA treatment. Chronic exhaustive exercise also increased the expressions of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines, while WA treatment significantly decreased the level of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines. However, chronic exhaustive exercise did not affect the NO production. These findings demonstrated that WA could alleviate the chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue and improve the learning and memory ability, and the actions might be related to the reduction of inflammatory response and iNOS expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of the ERP-Based BCI Performance Among Chromatic (RGB) Semitransparent Face Patterns</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that combing with color properties may be used as part of the display presented to BCI users in order to improve performance. Build on this, we explored the effects of combinations of face stimuli with three primary colors (RGB) on BCI performance which is assessed by classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, we analyzed the waveforms of three patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared three patterns in which semitransparent face is overlaid three primary colors as stimuli: red semitransparent face (RSF), green semitransparent face (GSF), and blue semitransparent face (BSF). Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to construct the individual classifier model. In addition, a Repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were chosen for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that the RSF pattern achieved the highest online averaged accuracy with 93.89%, followed by the GSF pattern with 87.78%, while the lowest performance was caused by the BSF pattern with an accuracy of 81.39%. Furthermore, significant differences in classification accuracy and ITR were found between RSF and GSF (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and between RSF and BSF patterns (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The semitransparent faces colored red (RSF) pattern yielded the best performance of the three patterns. The proposed patterns based on ERP-BCI system have a clinically significant impact by increasing communication speed and accuracy of the P300-speller for patients with severe motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Structural Variants May Be a Source of Missing Heritability in sALS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain poorly understood. Structural variants within the genome can play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease risk, such as the repeat expansion in C9orf72 and the tri-nucleotide repeat in ATXN2, both of which are associated with familial and sporadic ALS. Many such structural variants reside in uncharacterized regions of the human genome, and have been under studied. Therefore, characterization of structural variants located in and around genes associated with ALS could provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and lead to the discovery of highly informative genetic tools for stratification in clinical trials. Such genomic variants may provide a deeper understanding of how gene expression can affect disease etiology, disease severity and trajectory, patient response to treatment, and may hold the key to understanding the genetics of sporadic ALS. This article outlines the current understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genetics and how structural variations may underpin some of the missing heritability of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Visuospatial dysfunction (VSD) is one of the most important symptoms for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this study was to validate a novel VSD questionnaire and determine the cutoff score for the screening for VSD in DLB.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis of data from a project of the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System (HAICDDS). VSD of non-demented control (NDC), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and DLB participants were analyzed and compared using the visuospatial questionnaire in the HAICDDS (HAI-VSQ), the Draw subscale in the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI-Draw), and the visuospatial subscale in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-VS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 440 individuals were studied, including 154 NDC, 229 AD, and 57 DLB participants. Compared to NDC or AD participants, DLB participants showed a higher total score on HAI-VSQ after adjustment for age. Using HAI-VSQ, a cutoff score ≥ 2 was useful for the screening for VSD in DLB with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.94. Compared with CASI-Draw or MoCA-VS, HAI-VSQ was least influenced by gender, age, and education and had the highest correlation with the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. After adjustment for age, education, gender, and global cognitive function, HAI-VSQ significantly discriminated DLB from AD and NDC whereas MoCA-VS or CASI-Draw did not.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that the newly designed simple questionnaire was a practical screening tool for VSD in DLB that can be applied in clinical practice as well as on a registration platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Subcortical Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation (iTBS) Increases Theta-Power in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cognitive symptoms from Parkinson’s disease cause severe disability and significantly limit quality of life. Little is known about mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD, although aberrant oscillatory activity in basal ganglia-thalamo-prefrontal cortical circuits likely plays an important role. While continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor symptoms, it is generally ineffective for cognitive symptoms. Although we lack robust treatment options for these symptoms, recent studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), applying intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), suggest beneficial effects for certain aspects of cognition, such as memory or inhibitory control. While TMS is non-invasive, its results are transient and require repeated application. Subcortical DBS targets have strong reciprocal connections with prefrontal cortex, such that iTBS through the permanently implanted lead might represent a more durable solution. Here we demonstrate safety and feasibility for delivering iTBS from the DBS electrode and explore changes in DLPFC electrophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled seven participants with medically refractory Parkinson’s disease who underwent DBS surgery targeting either the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi). We temporarily placed an electrocorticography strip over DLPFC through the DBS burr hole. After placement of the DBS electrode into either GPi (n = 3) or STN (n = 4), awake subjects rested quietly during iTBS (three 50-Hz pulses delivered at 5 Hz for 2 s, followed by 8 s of rest). We contrasted power spectra in DLPFC local field potentials during iTBS versus at rest, as well as between iTBS and conventional high-frequency stimulation (HFS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Dominant frequencies in DLPFC at rest varied among subjects and along the subdural strip electrode, though they were generally localized in theta (3–8 Hz) and/or beta (10–30 Hz) ranges. Both iTBS and HFS were well-tolerated and imperceptible. iTBS increased theta-frequency activity more than HFS. Further, GPi stimulation resulted in significantly greater theta-power versus STN stimulation in our sample.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Acute subcortical iTBS from the DBS electrode was safe and well-tolerated. This novel stimulation pattern delivered from the GPi may increase theta-frequency power in ipsilateral DLPFC. Future studies will confirm these changes in DLPFC activity during iTBS and evaluate whether they are associated with improvements in cognitive or behavioral symptoms from PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: The Hemodynamic Mass Action of a Central Pattern Generator</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00038</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00038</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hemodynamic response is a neurovascular and metabolic process in which there is rapid delivery of blood flow to a neuronal tissue in response to neuronal activation. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), for instance, are based on the physiological principles of such hemodynamic responses. Both techniques allow the mapping of active neuronal regions in which the neurovascular and metabolic events are occurring. However, although both techniques have revolutionized the neurosciences, they are mostly employed for neuroimaging of the human brain but not for the spinal cord during functional tasks. Moreover, little is known about other techniques measuring the hemodynamic response in the spinal cord. The purpose of the present study was to show for the first time that a simple optical system termed direct current photoplethysmography (DC-PPG) can be employed to detect hemodynamic responses of the spinal cord and the brainstem during the functional activation of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG). In particular, we positioned two DC-PPG systems directly on the brainstem and spinal cord during fictive scratching in the cat. The optical DC-PPG systems allowed the trial-by-trial recording of massive hemodynamic signals. We found that the “strength” of the flexor-plus-extensor motoneuron activities during motor episodes of fictive scratching was significantly correlated to the “strengths” of the brainstem and spinal DC-PPG signals. Because the DC-PPG was robustly detected in real-time, we claim that such a functional signal reflects the hemodynamic mass action of the brainstem and spinal cord associated with the CPG motor action. Our findings shed light on an unexplored hemodynamic observable of the spinal CPGs, providing a proof of concept that the DC-PPG can be used for the assessment of the integrity of the human CPGs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Resting-State Functional Connectivity Estimated With Hierarchical Bayesian Diffuse Optical Tomography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00032</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been generally assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) thanks to its high spatial resolution. However, fMRI has several disadvantages such as high cost and low portability. In addition, fMRI may not be appropriate for people with metal or electronic implants in their bodies, with claustrophobia and who are pregnant. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), a method of neuroimaging using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to reconstruct three-dimensional brain activity images, offers a non-invasive alternative, because fNIRS as well as fMRI measures changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations and, in addition, fNIRS is free of above disadvantages. We recently proposed a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) DOT algorithm and verified its performance in terms of task-related brain responses. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the HB DOT in terms of estimating RSFC. In 20 healthy males (21–38 years old), 10 min of resting-state data was acquired with 3T MRI scanner or high-density NIRS on different days. The NIRS channels consisted of 96 long (29-mm) source-detector (SD) channels and 56 short (13-mm) SD channels, which covered bilateral frontal and parietal areas. There were one and two resting-state runs in the fMRI and fNIRS experiments, respectively. The reconstruction performances of our algorithm and the two currently prevailing algorithms for DOT were evaluated using fMRI signals as a reference. Compared with the currently prevailing algorithms, our HB algorithm showed better performances in both the similarity to fMRI data and inter-run reproducibility, in terms of estimating the RSFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Object&lt;p&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but the neural basis of EDS in PD is unclear. We aim to analyze the neural activity changes in PD-related EDS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the present study, 38 PD patients and 19 healthy controls underwent clinical assessments and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T. Patients were further classified into PD patients with EDS (n = 17) and PD patients without EDS (n = 21), according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) cutoff score with greater than 10 or less than 3. We evaluated all patients using PD-related motor and non-motor clinical scales. An analysis of covariance and post hoc two-sample t-tests were performed to examine between-groups differences of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that, all PD-EDS subjects in our study were male. Compared with the control subjects, PD patients with EDS had decreased ALFF in the Pons and increased ALFF in the Frontal_Mid_Orb_L (p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected). Moreover, PD patients with EDS showed decreased ALFF in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) relative to PD without EDS, which was negatively correlated with the ESS score (p &amp;lt; 0.001). After that, the FC analysis with the left PCC region of interest showed reduced FC of the right PCC and right precuneus in PD with EDS compared with PD without EDS (p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized the wake-promoting pathways and the default mode network dysfunction underlying the EDS in male PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measures of brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), two complementary modalities, are ground solutions in the context of neurofeedback (NF) mechanisms for brain rehabilitation protocols. While NF-EEG (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from EEG signals) has been explored for a very long time, NF-fMRI (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI signals) appeared more recently and provides more robust results and more specific brain training. Using fMRI and EEG simultaneously for bi-modal neurofeedback sessions (NF-EEG-fMRI, in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI and EEG) is very promising for the design of brain rehabilitation protocols. However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different NF-predictors stemming from the proposed model. We showed that predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG scores and significantly improves the correlation with bi-modal NF sessions compared to classical NF-EEG scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a complex biological response to injuries, metabolic disorders or infections. In the brain, astrocytes play an important role in the inflammatory processes during neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that the increase of free saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid produces a metabolic inflammatory response in astrocytes generally associated with damaging mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagic defects. In this aspect, the synthetic neurosteroid tibolone has shown to exert protective functions against inflammation in neuronal experimental models without the tumorigenic effects exerted by sexual hormones such as estradiol and progesterone. However, there is little information regarding the specific mechanisms of tibolone in astrocytes during inflammatory insults. In the present study, we performed a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of astrocytes that was used to study astrocytic response during an inflammatory insult by palmitate through Flux Balance Analysis methods and data mining. In this aspect, we assessed the metabolic fluxes of human astrocytes under three different scenarios: healthy (normal conditions), induced inflammation by palmitate, and tibolone treatment under palmitate inflammation. Our results suggest that tibolone reduces the L-glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in astrocytes through the modulation of several metabolic pathways involved in glutamate uptake. We also identified a set of reactions associated with the protective effects of tibolone, including the upregulation of taurine metabolism, gluconeogenesis, cPPAR and the modulation of calcium signaling pathways. In conclusion, the different scenarios studied in our model allowed us to identify several metabolic fluxes perturbed under an inflammatory response and the protective mechanisms exerted by tibolone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Systems Biology section | New and Recent Articles: Simplified Model of PKCγ Signaling Dysregulation and Cytosol-to-Membrane Translocation Kinetics During Neurodegenerative Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14 (SCA14)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01397</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01397</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by progressive ataxia in the patient’s gait, accompanied by slurred speech and abnormal eye movements. These symptoms are linked to the loss of Purkinje cells (PCs), which leads to cerebellar neurodegeneration. PC observations link the mutations in PRKCG gene encoding protein kinase C γ (PKCγ) to SCA14. Observations also show that the link between PKCγ and SCA14 relies on a gain-of-function mechanism, and, in fact, both positive and negative regulation of PKCγ expression and activity may result in changes in cellular number, size, and complexity of the dendritic arbors in PCs. Here, through a systems biology approach, we investigate a key question relating to this system: why is PKCγ membrane residence time reduced in SCA14 mutant PCs compared to wild-type (WT) PCs? In this study, we investigate this question through two contrasting PKCγ signaling models in PCs. The first model proposed in this study describes the mechanism through which PKCγ signaling activity may be regulated in WT PCs. In contrast, the second model explores how mutations in PKCγ signaling affect the state of SCA14 in PCs. Numerical simulations of both models show that, in response to extracellular stimuli-induced depolarization of the membrane compartment, PKCγ and diacylglycerol kinase γ (DGKγ) translocate to the membrane. Results from our computational approach indicate that, for the same set of parameters, PKCγ membrane residence time is shorter in the SCA14 mutant model compared to the WT model. These results show how PKCγ membrane residence time is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), causing translocated PKCγ to return to the cytosol as DAG levels drop. This study shows that, when the strength of the extracellular signal is held constant, the membrane lifetime of mutant PKCγ is reduced. This reduction is due to the presence of constitutively active mutant PKCγ in the cytosol. Cytosolic PKCγ, in turn, leads to phosphorylation and activation of DGKγ while it is still residing in the cytosol. This effect occurs even during the resting conditions. Thus, the SCA14 mutant model explains that, when both DAG effector molecules are active in the cytosol, their interactions in the membrane compartment are reduced, critically influencing PKCγ membrane residence time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Increased Presence of Cerebral Microbleeds Correlates With Ventricular Enlargement and Increased White Matter Hyperintensities in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate whether the number of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) could be a useful indicator to predict glymphatic system dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, by comparing the degree of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) stasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty probable AD patients were included, with those exhibiting two or more CMB were included in the multiple CMB group (mCMB, n = 21, mean = 11.1), and none or one CMB included in the non-multiple CMB group (nmCMB, n = 19, mean = 0.84). CMB was defined in axial gradient recalled echo (GRE) T2*-weighted images. Evans index (EI) was calculated to measure lateral ventricle enlargement, Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer’s Disease (VSRAD) software was used to determine the extent of gray and white matter atrophy, and Fazekas scale (FS) was used to determine white matter hyperintensities (WMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: EI was significantly larger in mCMB than in nmCMB, while the gray and white matter volume was not different between groups. Thus, the difference in lateral ventricle enlargement between AD with and without multiple CMB reflects a combination of the degree of brain atrophy and the extent of CSF stasis. FS was higher in mCMB than in the nmCMB, suggesting the failure of ISF elimination was more severe in mCMB cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The difference in lateral ventricle enlargement and WMH between AD with or without multiple CMB may reflect a difference in the degree of CSF/ISF stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for numerous neurological disorders, and the mechanisms underlying brain aging remain elusive. Recent animal studies demonstrated a tight relationship between impairment of the glymphatic pathway, meningeal lymphatic vessels, and aging. However, the relationship in the human brain remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort study, patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and at multiple time points after intrathecal administration of a contrast agent. Head T1‐weighted imaging was performed to assess the function of the glymphatic pathway and head high‐resolution T2–fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging to visualize putative meningeal lymphatic vessels (pMLVs). We measured the signal unit ratio (SUR) of 6 locations in the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs, defined the percentage change in SUR from baseline to 39 hours as the clearance of the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs, and then analyzed their relationships with aging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all patients (N = 35), the SUR of the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs changed significantly after intrathecal injection of the contrast agent. The clearance of both the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs was related to aging (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The clearance of pMLVs was significantly related to the clearance of the glymphatic pathway (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and the clearance of the glymphatic pathway was significantly faster in patients with early filling of pMLVs than those with late filling (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revealed that both the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs might be impaired in the aging human brain through the novel, clinically available method to simultaneously visualize their clearance. Our findings also support that in humans, pMLVs are the downstream of the glymphatic pathway. &lt;b&gt;Ann Neurol 2020;87:357–369&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Excessive Treadmill Training Enhances Brain-Specific MicroRNA-34a in the Mouse Hippocampus</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00007</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: An imbalance between total training load and total recovery may cause overtraining (OT). The purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of OT on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and p75 and the dynamic expression patterns of brain-specific miR-34a and miR-124 or inflammation-related miR-21 and miR-132 in the mouse hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Eight weeks old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the control (CON), normal training (NT) and OT groups. An 8-week OT training protocol was applied to evaluate the phenotype of mice endurance (incremental load test, ILT) and cognitive capacity (Morris water maze test). We used qRT-PCR and immunoblotting to detect changes in the molecular level of hippocampal samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Compared with the CON, both NT and OT decreased bodyweight after 8-week training. After 8-week of training, NT increased the exhaustion velocity (EV) while the EV of OT was lower than NT. Mice in NT decreased the escape latency than CON. The percentage of time spent in the probe quadrant and the number of crossing platform times in NT were higher than CON and OT. The BDNF, p75 and TrkB mRNA levels were increased in NT than CON, only the p75 mRNA was increased in OT. The NT exhibited increased protein levels of BDNF and TrkB compared to CON. The protein expression of BDNF was decreased in OT than NT and CON. The protein level of p75 in the OT was higher than in NT and CON. In addition, the phosphorylation level of TrkB in OT was higher than CON and NT. Only the miR-34a level was increased in the OT. Moreover, the expression of miR-34a was found to be negatively correlated with the expression of BDNF, and the increase in miR-34a level was accompanied by a decrease in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In summary, the training-evoked increase in the BDNF level may help to improve performance, whereas this conditioning is lost after OT. Moreover, miR-34a potentially mediated changes in the expression of BDNF and may reflect the decrease in performance after OT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Using Neural Circuit Interrogation in Rodents to Unravel Human Speech Decoding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neural circuits responsible for social communication are among the least understood in the brain. Human studies have made great progress in advancing our understanding of the global computations required for processing speech, and animal models offer the opportunity to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding these signals. In this review article, we describe some of the most well-established speech decoding computations from human studies and describe animal research designed to reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. Human and animal brains must perform the challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to communicative functions is pivotal. We review recent advances in human recordings that have revealed the most basic unit of speech decoded by neurons is a phoneme, and consider circuit-mapping studies in rodents that have shown potential connectivity schemes to achieve this. Finally, we discuss other potentially important processing features in humans like lateralization, sensitivity to fine temporal features, and hierarchical processing. The goal is for animal studies to investigate neurophysiological and anatomical pathways responsible for establishing behavioral phenotypes that are shared between humans and animals. This can be accomplished by establishing cell types, connectivity patterns, genetic pathways and critical periods that are relevant in the development and function of social communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: CHIT1 at Diagnosis Reflects Long‐Term Multiple Sclerosis Disease Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25691?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25691?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for a role of microglia in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is growing. We investigated association of microglial markers at time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) with different aspects of disease activity (relapses, disability, magnetic resonance imaging parameters) up to 6 years later in a cohort of 143 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we measured 3 macrophage and microglia‐related proteins, chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase‐3–like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL‐40), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), as well as a marker of neuronal damage, neurofilament light chain (NfL), using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and electrochemiluminescence. We investigated the same microglia‐related markers in publicly available RNA expression data from postmortem brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHIT1 levels at diagnostic LP correlated with 2 aspects of long‐term disease activity after correction for multiple testing. First, CHIT1 increased with reduced tissue integrity in lesions at a median 3 years later (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.6E‐04). Second, CHIT1 reflected disease severity at a median 5 years later (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.2E‐04). Together with known clinical covariates, CHIT1 levels explained 12% and 27% of variance in these 2 measures, respectively, and were able to distinguish slow and fast disability progression (area under the curve = 85%). CHIT1 was the best discriminator of chronic active versus chronic inactive lesions and the only marker correlated with NfL (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0019). Associations with disease activity were, however, independent of NfL.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHIT1 CSF levels measured during the diagnostic LP reflect microglial activation early on in MS and can be considered a valuable prognostic biomarker for future disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Independent Functional Outcomes after Prolonged Coma following Cardiac Arrest: A Mechanistic Hypothesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25690?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25690?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors of prolonged (&amp;gt;2 weeks) post–cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post‐CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post‐CA patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17–37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post‐CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (~4–7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSP with theta (~4–7Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post‐CA coma.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Natural History of Adult Patients with GM2 Gangliosidosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25689?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM2 gangliosidoses are lysosomal diseases due to biallelic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;HEXA&lt;/i&gt; (Tay–Sachs disease [TS]) or &lt;i&gt;HEXB&lt;/i&gt; (Sandhoff disease [SD]) genes, with subsequent low hexosaminidase(s) activity. Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed 4 typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above 3 manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of GM2 gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase and Brain Cholesterol Metabolism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00325</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bifunctional enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is found in all regions of the brain. It has two different catalytic activities, each assigned to one of its terminal domains: the C-terminal domain presents hydrolase activity, whereas the N-terminal domain exhibits phosphatase activity. The enzyme’s C-terminal domain has been linked to cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Cholesterol-related disorders have been associated with sEH, which plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol precursors. The role of sEH’s phosphatase activity has been so far poorly investigated in the context of the central nervous system physiology. Given that brain cholesterol disturbances play a role in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as of other neurodegenerative diseases, understanding the functions of this enzyme could provide pivotal information on the pathophysiology of these conditions. Moreover, the sEH phosphatase domain could represent an underexplored target for drug design and therapeutic strategies to improve symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the function of sEH in mammals and its protein structure and catalytic activities. Particular attention was given to the distribution and expression of sEH in the human brain, deepening into the enzyme’s phosphatase activity and its participation in brain cholesterol synthesis. Finally, this review focused on the metabolism of cholesterol and its association with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Axonal Endoplasmic Reticulum Dynamics and Its Roles in Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00048</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The physical continuity of axons over long cellular distances poses challenges for their maintenance. One organelle that faces this challenge is endoplasmic reticulum (ER); unlike other intracellular organelles, this forms a physically continuous network throughout the cell, with a single membrane and a single lumen. In axons, ER is mainly smooth, forming a tubular network with occasional sheets or cisternae and low amounts of rough ER. It has many potential roles: lipid biosynthesis, glucose homeostasis, a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store, protein export, and contacting and regulating other organelles. This tubular network structure is determined by ER-shaping proteins, mutations in some of which are causative for neurodegenerative disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While axonal ER shares many features with the tubular ER network in other contexts, these features must be adapted to the long and narrow dimensions of axons. ER appears to be physically continuous throughout axons, over distances that are enormous on a subcellular scale. It is therefore a potential channel for long-distance or regional communication within neurons, independent of action potentials or physical transport of cargos, but involving its physiological roles such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or organelle homeostasis. Despite its apparent stability, axonal ER is highly dynamic, showing features like anterograde and retrograde transport, potentially reflecting continuous fusion and breakage of the network. Here we discuss the transport processes that must contribute to this dynamic behavior of ER. We also discuss the model that these processes underpin a homeostatic process that ensures both enough ER to maintain continuity of the network and repair breaks in it, but not too much ER that might disrupt local cellular physiology. Finally, we discuss how failure of ER organization in axons could lead to axon degenerative diseases, and how a requirement for ER continuity could make distal axons most susceptible to degeneration in conditions that disrupt ER continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment via Modulating Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Autophagy in a Rat Model of Vascular Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00028</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the potential applications and the molecular mechanisms of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive impairment in a vascular dementia (VD) animal model. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. VD rat model was induced by modified permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) approach. Anodal tDCS was applied to the animals. Morris water maze was used to analyze spatial memory and navigation ability. The pathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 region and cerebral cortex were examined via Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. The rats were sacrificed for the measurement of the level of superoxide (SOD), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxidative species (ROS), malondialdehyd (MDA), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level in the hippocampus. Western blot was carried out to measure the hippocampal expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3) and p62. Rats with VD have decreased number of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as worse cognitive impairment. The proliferation of activated microglia and astroglia, accompanied with attenuation of myelination were observed in the white matter about 1 month after 2-VO operation. These abnormalities were significantly ameliorated by tDCS treatment. Further study revealed that anodal tDCS could suppress the MDA and ROS level, while enhance the SOD and GSH level to reduce the oxidative stress. Anodal tDCS could inhibit hypoperfusion-induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression to attenuate inflammatory response in hippocampus. Moreover, anodal tDCS treatment could alleviate autophagy level. The study has demonstrated a possible therapeutic role of tDCS in the treatment of cognitive impairment in VD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Early Maternal and Social Deprivation Expands Neural Stem Cell Population Size and Reduces Hippocampus/Amygdala-Dependent Fear Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early life stress can exert detrimental or beneficial effects on neural development and postnatal behavior depending on the timing, duration, strength, and ability to control the stressors. In this study, we utilized a maternal and social deprivation (MSD) model to investigate the effects of early life stress on neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurogenesis in the adult brain. We found that MSD during the stress-hyporesponsive period (SHRP) (early-MSD), when corticosterone secretion is suppressed, increased the size of the NSC population, whereas the same stress beyond the SHRP abrogated these effects. Early-MSD enhanced neurogenesis not only in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, one of the classic neurogenic regions, but also in the amygdala. In addition, mice exposed to early-MSD exhibited a reduction in amygdala/hippocampus-dependent fear memory. These results suggest that animals exposed to early life stress during the SHRP have reinforced stress resilience to cope with perceived stressors to maintain a normal homeostatic state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Role of Cholesterol in Modulating the Binding of α-Synuclein to Synaptic-Like Vesicles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00018</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00018</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (αS) is a presynaptic protein whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the physiological function of αS is still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate that this protein may play a role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles (SVs) during neurotransmitter release, a task associated with its ability to bind SVs and promote their clustering. It is therefore crucial to identify the cellular factors that modulate this process. To address this question, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we have characterized the role of cholesterol, a major component of the membrane of SVs, in the binding of αS with synaptic-like vesicles. Our results indicate that cholesterol can act as a modulator of the overall affinity of αS for SVs by reducing the local affinity of the region spanning residues 65–97 in the non-amyloid-β component (NAC) of the protein. The increased population of bound states that expose the region 65–97 to the solvent was found to induce stronger vesicle-vesicle interactions by αS. These results provide evidence that cholesterol modulates the clustering of synaptic vesicles induced by (α)S, and supports the role of the disorder-to-order equilibrium of the NAC region in the modulation of the biological properties of the membrane-bound state of αS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Environmental Tobacco Smoke During the Early Postnatal Period of Mice Interferes With Brain 18 F-FDG Uptake From Infancy to Early Adulthood – A Longitudinal Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00005</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00005</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, mainly in childhood. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of postnatal ETS exposure in the brain 2-deoxy-2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluoro-D-glucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) uptake of mice by positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging in a longitudinal study. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ETS that was generated from 3R4F cigarettes from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P14. PET analyses were performed in male and female mice during infancy (P15), adolescence (P35), and adulthood (P65). We observed that ETS exposure decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in the whole brain, both left and right hemispheres, and frontal cortex in both male and female infant mice, while female infant mice exposed to ETS showed decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in the cerebellum. In addition, all mice showed reduced &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in infancy, compared to adulthood in all analyzed VOIs. In adulthood, ETS exposure during the early postnatal period decreased brain &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in adult male mice in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and thalamus when compared to control group. ETS induced an increase in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in adult female mice when compared to control group in the brainstem and cingulate cortex. Moreover, male ETS-exposed animals showed decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake when compared to female ETS-exposed in the whole brain, brainstem, cortex, left amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, basal forebrain and septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and midbrain. The present study shows that several brain regions are vulnerable to ETS exposure during the early postnatal period and these effects on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake are observed even a long time after the last exposure. This study corroborates our previous findings, strengthening the idea that exposure to tobacco smoke in a critical period interferes with brain development of mice from late infancy to early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Machine Learning Approach to the Differentiation of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) From a Sedentary Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00002</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition estimated to impact at least 1 million individuals in the United States, however there persists controversy about its existence. Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified 29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: An Information Theoretic Approach to Reveal the Formation of Shared Representations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modality-invariant categorical representations, i.e., shared representation, is thought to play a key role in learning to categorize multi-modal information. We have investigated how a bimodal autoencoder can form a shared representation in an unsupervised manner with multi-modal data. We explored whether altering the depth of the network and mixing the multi-modal inputs at the input layer affect the development of the shared representations. Based on the activation of units in the hidden layers, we classified them into four different types: visual cells, auditory cells, inconsistent visual and auditory cells, and consistent visual and auditory cells. Our results show that the number and quality of the last type (i.e., shared representation) significantly differ depending on the depth of the network and are enhanced when the network receives mixed inputs as opposed to separate inputs for each modality, as occurs in typical two-stage frameworks. In the present work, we present a way to utilize information theory to understand the abstract representations formed in the hidden layers of the network. We believe that such an information theoretic approach could potentially provide insights into the development of more efficient and cost-effective ways to train neural networks using qualitative measures of the representations that cannot be captured by analyzing only the final outputs of the networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Step-by-Step Protocol for Optogenetic Kindling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical kindling, repeated brain stimulation eventually resulting in seizures, is widely used as an animal model of epileptogenesis and epilepsy. However, the stimulation electrode used for electric kindling targets unknown neuronal populations and may introduce tissue damage and inflammation. Optogenetics can be used to circumvent these shortcomings by permitting millisecond control of activity in genetically defined neurons without gross injury or inflammation. Here we describe an easy step-by-step protocol for optogenetic kindling – optokindling – by which seizures are eventually elicited in initially healthy mice through repeated light stimulation of neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Chronic EEG recordings may be performed over large time scales to monitor activity while video camera monitoring may be used to assess the behavioral severity of seizures. In conclusion, with optokindling, neuroscientists can elucidate the circuit changes that underpin epilepsy while minimizing the contribution of confounding factors such as brain damage and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Clinical and Molecular Aspects of Senataxin Mutations in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 4</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25681?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25681?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the clinical and molecular features in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) due to mutations in the senataxin (&lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt;) gene and to develop tools for evaluating &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study involved 32 patients, including 31 with mutation in &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; at c.1166 T&amp;gt;C (p.Leu389Ser) and 1 with mutation at c.1153 G&amp;gt;A (p.Glu385Lys). Clinical characterization of the patients included neurological examination, blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fibroblasts and motor neurons were obtained to model the disease and characterize the molecular alteration in senataxin function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report key clinical features of ALS4. Laboratory analysis showed alteration of serum creatine kinase and creatinine in the Leu389Ser ALS4 cohort. MRI showed increased muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities, which correlates with disease duration (thigh fat fraction &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; lower leg fat fraction &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.49, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). DEXA measurements showed lower extremities are more affected than upper extremities (average fat &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scores of 2.1 and 0.6, respectively). A cellular assay for SETX function confirmed that like the Leu389Ser mutation, the Glu385Lys variant leads to a decrease in R loops, likely from a gain of function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified clinical laboratory and radiological features of ALS4, and hence they should be monitored for disease progression. The molecular characterization of R‐loop levels in patient‐derived cells provides insight into the disease pathology and assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of candidate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; gene.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The electrophysiology of the paralimbic network (“default mode”) for self-awareness has drawn much attention in the past couple of decades. In contrast, knowledge of the molecular organization of conscious experience has only lately come into focus. We here review newer data on dopaminergic control of awareness in humans, particularly in self-awareness. These results implicate mainly dopaminergic neurotransmission and the control of GABAergic function directly in the paralimbic network. The findings are important for understanding addiction, developmental disorders, and dysfunctional consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) structures regulating developmental plasticity and protecting neurons against oxidative stress. PNN abnormalities have been observed in various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but the relationship between PNN density and depression still remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the density and components of PNNs including aggrecan, neurocan and Tenascin-R in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We found that depressive-like behaviors were induced after 30 days of CUMS accompanied by decreases in PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density and aggrecan expression in the PrL. In addition, rats subjected to 20 days of CUMS were separated into vulnerable and resilient subpopulations that differ along several behavioral domains. Consistently, the density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the vulnerable group were decreased compared to control and resilient groups. Finally, we examined individual differences based on locomotion in a novel context and classified rats as high responding (HR) and low responding (LR) phenotypes. The density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the LR group were lower than the HR group. Moreover, the LR rats were more susceptible to depressive-like behaviors compared with HR rats. Altogether, these results suggest that the density of PNNs in the PrL is associated with depressive-like behaviors in young-aged rats, and it may serve as a potential endophenotype or therapeutic target for depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
