	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Crossed Cerebellar Diaschisis in Patients with Diffuse Glioma Is Associated with Impaired Supratentorial Cerebrovascular Reactivity and Worse Clinical Outcome</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Ataxia Associated with CADASIL: a Pathology-Confirmed Case Report and Literature Review</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &amp;gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/em&gt; gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cathodal Cerebellar tDCS Combined with Visual Feedback Improves Balance Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01172-0</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Damage Affects Contextual Priors for Action Prediction in Patients with Childhood Brain Tumor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01168-w</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01168-w</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATXN3&lt;/em&gt;. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Genetic anticipation was frequently observed between generations but not affected by the delta-expCAG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation Combined with Vestibular Rehabilitation Improves Gait and Balance in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: a Preliminary Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01166-y</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Effects of Cerebellar tDCS on Inhibitory Control: Evidence from a Go/NoGo Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01165-z</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Is Purkinje Neuron Hyperpolarisation Important for Cerebellar Synaptic Plasticity? A Retrospective and Prospective Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. When the CF input is paired with parallel fibre (PF) activity, the signal is locally amplified at the sites of PF-activated synapses according to the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; at the time of the CF input, suggesting that the standing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical parameter for the induction of PF synaptic plasticity. In this review, I analyse how the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can potentially play a role in cerebellar learning focussing, in particular, on the hyperpolarised state that appears to occur episodically, since PNs are mostly firing under physiological conditions. By revisiting the recent literature reporting in vivo recordings and synaptic plasticity studies, I speculate on how a putative role of the PN &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can provide an interpretation for the results of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Volumes Associate with Behavioral Phenotypes in Prader-Willi Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Associations of Reading Efficiency with White Matter Properties of the Cerebellar Peduncles in Children</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .63, right: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .76, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .43, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .040) and right SCP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .37, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Essential Tremor Within the Broader Context of Other Forms of Cerebellar Degeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: GIRK1-Mediated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Current Is a Candidate Mechanism Behind Purkinje Cell Excitability, Plasticity, and Neuromodulation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Abnormal Cerebellar Volume in Patients with Remitted Major Depression with Persistent Cognitive Deficits</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The influence of the Sander parallelogram illusion and early, middle and late vision on goal-directed reaching and grasping</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vision is one of the most robust sensory inputs used for the execution of goal-directed actions. Despite a history of extensive visuomotor research, how individuals process visual context for the execution of movements continues to be debated. This experiment examines how early, middle and late visuomotor control is impacted by illusory characteristics in a reaching and grasping task. Participants either manually estimated or reached out and picked up a three-dimensional target bar resting on a two-dimensional picture of the Sander parallelogram illusion. Participants performed their grasps within a predefined time movement window based on their own average grasp time, allowing for the manipulation of visual feedback. On some trials, vision was only available before the response cue (an auditory tone), while on others vision was occluded until the response cue, becoming available for either the full, early, middle or late portions of the movement. While results showed that the effect of the illusion was stronger on manual estimations than on grasping, maximum grip apertures in the occluded vision and early vision grasping conditions were also consistent to a lesser extent with the illusion. The late vision condition showed longer movement time, wrist deceleration period, time to maximum grip aperture and lower maximum velocity. These findings indicate that visual context affects visuomotor control distinctly depending on when vision is available, and supports the notion that human vision is comprised of two functionally and anatomically distinct systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Spatiotemporal characteristics of locomotor adaptation of walking with two handheld poles</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pole walking (PW) has received attention not only as a whole-body exercise that can be adapted for elderly people with poor physical fitness but also as a possible intervention for the restoration of gait function in normal walking without the use of poles (i.e., conventional walking CW). However, the characteristics of PW, especially how and why PW training affects CW, remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of locomotor adaptation in PW from the perspective of kinematic variables. For this purpose, we compared the locomotor adaptation in PW and CW to that when walking on a split-belt treadmill in terms of spatial and temporal coordination. The result showed that adaptations to the split-belt treadmill in PW and CW were found only in interlimb parameters (step length and double support time ratios (fast/slow limb)), not in intralimb parameters (stride length and stance time ratios). In these interlimb parameters, the movement patterns acquired through split-belt locomotor adaptations (i.e., the aftereffects) were transferred between CW and PW regardless of whether the novel movement patterns were learned in CW or PW. The aftereffects of double support time and step length learned in CW were completely washed out by the subsequent execution in PW. On the other hand, the aftereffect of double support time learned in PW was not completely washed out by the subsequent execution in CW, whereas the aftereffect of step length learned in PW was completely washed out by the subsequent execution in CW. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms related to controlling interlimb parameters are shared between CW and PW, and it is possible that, in interlimb coordination, temporal coordination is preferentially stored in adaptation during PW.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The instantaneous training demand drives vestibulo-ocular reflex adaptation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) maintains stable vision during rapid head rotations by rotating the eyes in the opposite direction to the head. The latency between onset of the head rotation and onset of the eye rotation is 5–8 ms in healthy humans. However, VOR latency can be 3–4 times larger in patients treated with intra-tympanic gentamicin. A prior study showed that latency can be trained with head rotations at 0.2 Hz. We sought to determine how the VOR is affected when a delay between vestibular and visual stimuli is added during adaptation training with high-frequency head rotations (impulses), where the VOR is the main vision-stabilizing system. Using a variant of the incremental VOR adaptation technique, the delay between head rotation onset and movement onset of a visual target was gradually increased. With this training, the instantaneous VOR gain demand (= target/head velocity) varied from less than unity to greater than unity during each head impulse, albeit in a consistent and repeatable way. We measured the active and passive VOR gain and latency before and after VOR adaptation training in healthy normal subjects. There was no significant change in VOR latency across subjects; however, there was a significant decrease in VOR gain of − 6.0 ± 4.5%. These data suggest that during high-frequency head rotations delay/latency is interpreted as a changing instantaneous VOR gain demand. Although the gain demand in this study had a complex trajectory, adaptation was evident with the VOR seeming to use an average of the instantaneous gain demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Relationship between interhemispheric inhibition and bimanual coordination: absence of instrument specificity on motor performance in professional musicians</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Functional reorganization in a musician’s brain has long been considered strong evidence of experience-dependent neuroplasticity. Highly coordinated bimanual movements require abundant communication between bilateral hemispheres. Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) is the communication between bilateral primary motor cortices, and there is beginning evidence to suggest that IHI is modified according to instrument type, possibly due to instrument-dependent motor training. However, it is unknown whether IHI adaptations are associated with non-musical bimanual tasks that resemble specific musical instruments. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between IHI and bimanual coordination in keyboard players compared with string players. Bimanual coordination was measured by a force tracking task, categorized as symmetric and asymmetric conditions. Ipsilateral silent period (iSP) was obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation to index IHI in both left (L) and right (R) hemispheres. Canonical correlation analysis was performed to identify linear relationships between the IHI and bimanual coordination outcomes. There was no difference in bimanual coordination outcomes between keyboard and string players. Increased iSP from the L to R hemisphere was found in string players compared to keyboard players. There appeared to be different instrument-dependent relationships between IHI and bimanual coordination, regardless of symmetric or asymmetric task. Laboratory motor assessments resembling specific features of musical instruments (symmetric vs. asymmetric hand use) did not distinctly characterize bimanual motor skills between keyboard and string players. The relationships between IHI and bimanual coordination in these two instrument types were independent of task condition. Instrument-dependent neuroplasticity may be evident only within the context of musical instrument playing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Molecular hydrogen alleviates brain injury and cognitive impairment in a chronic sequelae model of murine polymicrobial sepsis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sepsis-related encephalopathy (SAE), which causes a series of brain injuries and long-term, potentially irreversible cognitive dysfunction, is closely associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Hydrogen (H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a new type of medical gas molecule that has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases in recent years. The aim of the present study was to explore the protective effects of H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation on brain injury and long-term cognitive impairment in an improved chronic septic mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into four groups: Control, Control + H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SAE and SAE + H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The SAE and Control models were established by intraperitoneal injection of human stool suspension or saline in mice. H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2%) was inhaled for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after SAE or Control treatment. The survival rates were recorded for 14 days (days 1–14) and the Morris Water Maze was performed for 7 days (days 8–14). To assess the severity of the brain injury, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, Evans blue (EB) extravasation and the wet/dry weight ratio of brain tissue were detected 24 h after SAE or Control treatment. In addition, inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the protein levels of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin, were measured 6, 12 and 24 h after SAE or Control treatment. The results showed that H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment increased survival rates, mitigated cognitive impairment, reduced hippocampal histological damage, decreased EB and water content, and decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1, Nrf2, HO-1, ZO-1 and Occludin, as compared with the SAE group. These data revealed that 2% H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could suppress brain damage and improve cognitive function in septic mice by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammatory response and the sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Multiple strategies to correct errors in foot placement and control speed in human walking</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neural feedback plays a key role in maintaining locomotor stability in the face of perturbations. In this study, we systematically identified properties of neural feedback that contribute to stabilizing human walking by examining how the nervous system responds to small kinematic deviations away from the desired gait pattern. We collected data from 20 participants (9 men and 11 women). We simultaneously applied (1) small continuous mechanical perturbations, forces at the ankles that affected foot placement, and (2) small continuous sensory perturbations, movement of a virtual visual scene that produced the illusion of change in walking speed, to compare how neural feedback responds to actual and illusory kinematic deviations. We computed phase-dependent impulse response functions that describe kinematic and muscular responses to small brief perturbations to identify critical phases of the gait cycle when the nervous system modulates muscle activity. In addition to the known foot-placement strategies that counteract kinematic displacement, such as the modulation of the hamstring muscle group during swing, we identified phase-specific muscle modulations that compensated for the perturbations. In particular, our results suggested that an early-stance modulation of anterior leg muscles (i.e., dorsiflexors and quadriceps) is a general control mechanism that serves to control forward body propulsion and compensates for errors in foot placement. Another detected general compensatory strategy was the late-stance modulation of the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius muscles, which controls walking speed in the next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Action and vision are known to be tightly coupled with each other. In a previous study, we found that repeatedly grasping an object without any visual feedback might result in a perceptual aftereffect when the object was visually presented in the context of a perceptual judgement task. In this study, we explored whether and how such an effect could be modulated by presenting the object behind a transparent barrier. Our conjecture was that if perceptual judgment relies, in part at least, on the same processes and representations as those involved in action, then one should expect to find a slowdown in judgment performance when the target object looks to be out of reach. And this was what we actually found. This indicates that not only acting upon an object but also being prevented from acting upon it can affect how the object is perceptually judged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetically based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and impaired visuospatial recognition. The aim of this study was to analyze the gait characteristics of WS children with impaired visuospatial recognition using a three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA) to clarify the gait adaptation needed to compensate for it. 3DGA was performed in 8 WS children with impaired visuospatial recognition (mean age, 11.8 years) and 9 age-, sex-, height-, and weight-matched controls. Clinical data, fundamental motor tests, and gait variables while walking on a flat surface and walking up a mat were compared between the two groups, and the correlations between variables were analyzed in the WS children. WS children showed impairment of balance function without muscle weakness. In walking on a flat surface, the WS group showed reduced walking speed, short step length, increased variability of step length, increased knee flexion throughout the stance phase, increased horizontal pelvic range of motion (ROM), and a low Gait Deviation Index and a high Gait Profile Score, which are indices of gait quality. In walking up a mat, the WS group showed further reduced walking speed and decreased sagittal hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion ROM in the swing phase. Impaired balance function was significantly correlated with increased variability of step length and decreased sagittal ankle dorsiflexion ROM in the swing phase. The detailed gait pattern of WS children with impaired visuospatial recognition was presented. These findings show that impaired visuospatial recognition and balance function contribute to gait adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Non-informative vision improves spatial tactile discrimination on the shoulder but does not influence detection sensitivity</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vision of the body has been reported to improve tactile acuity even when vision is not informative about the actual tactile stimulation. However, it is currently unclear whether this effect is limited to body parts such as hand, forearm or foot that can be normally viewed, or it also generalizes to body locations, such as the shoulder, that are rarely before our own eyes. In this study, subjects consecutively performed a detection threshold task and a numerosity judgment task of tactile stimuli on the shoulder. Meanwhile, they watched either a real-time video showing their shoulder or simply a fixation cross as control condition. We show that non-informative vision improves tactile numerosity judgment which might involve tactile acuity, but not tactile sensitivity. Furthermore, the improvement in tactile accuracy modulated by vision seems to be due to an enhanced ability in discriminating the number of adjacent active electrodes. These results are consistent with the view that bimodal visuotactile neurons sharp tactile receptive fields in an early somatosensory map, probably via top-down modulation of lateral inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study explores the involvement of substance P (SP) in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) in the nociception–emotion link and of rats with masticatory myofascial pain (MMP) induced by chronic tetanic eccentric muscle contraction. A total of 18 rats were randomly and equally assigned for MMP (MMP group) and sham-MMP induction (sMMP group). MMP was induced by electrical-stimulated repetitive tetanic eccentric contraction of the masseter muscle for 14 consecutive days. Myofascial trigger points in the masseter muscle were identified by palpable taut bands, increased prevalence of endplate noise (EPN), focal hypoechoic nodules on ultrasound and restricted jaw opening. All animals were killed for morphological and SP immunohistochemical analyses. Chronic tetanic eccentric contraction induced significantly thicker masseter muscle confirmed by hypoechogenicity, increased prevalence and amplitudes of EPN, and limited jaw opening. Immunohistochemically, the SP-like positive neurons increased significantly in PBN and CeA of the MMP group. Our results suggested that MMP increases the SP protein levels in PBN and CeA, which play important roles in MMP-mediated chronic pain processing as well as MMP-related emotional processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The impact of emotional videos and emotional static faces on postural control through a personality trait approach</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During social interactions, perception of emotions affects motor behaviour by triggering responses like freezing or approach and avoidance reactions. It is however difficult to get a clear picture of the relationship between emotion and posture as previous studies showed inconsistent results, due to methodological differences on stimuli and/or the postural measures used. In this study, we thoroughly investigate how the perception of emotions affects postural control and action tendencies, by contrasting two types of stimuli (emotional static faces or emotional videos) expressing different types of basic emotions (happy, fear, angry, sad, disgust and neutral). We also take into account some other contributing factors relying on stable individual traits (e.g., extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, empathy, etc) and emotional state (e.g., anxiety). Our results show that dynamic stimuli have a greater impact than static stimuli on postural control. Moreover, a crucial aspect of our work lay in the modulation of the relationship between emotions and posture, by stable individual traits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Examining the equivalence between imagery and execution within the spatial domain – Does motor imagery account for signal-dependent noise?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Motor imagery is suggested to be functionally equivalent to physical execution as they each utilise a common neural representation. The present study examined whether motor imagery correspondingly reflects the spatial characteristics of physically executed movements, including the signal-dependent noise that typically manifests in more variable end locations (as indicated by effective target width; W&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;). Participants executed or imagined a single, upper-limb target-directed aim in the horizontal medio-lateral direction. The start and end of the imagined movements were indexed by the lifting and lowering of the limb over the home position, respectively. Following each imagined movement, participants had to additionally estimate their imagined end location relative to the target. All the movements had to be completed at a pre-specified criterion time (400 ms, 600 ms, 800 ms). The results indicated that the W&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; increased following a decrease in movement time for execution, but not imagery. Moreover, the total error of imagined movements was greater than the actual error of executed movements. While motor imagery may comprise a neural representation that also contributes to the execution of movements, it is unable to closely reflect the random sources of variability. This limitation of motor imagery may be attributed to the comparatively limited efferent motor signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Negative relationship between brain α 1A -AR neurotransmission and βArr2 levels in anxious adolescent rats subjected to early life stress</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early-life stress is correlated with the development of anxiety-related behavior in adolescence, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly known. The α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptor (AR) is linked to mood regulation and its function is assumed to be regulated by β-arrestins (βArrs) via desensitization and downregulation. Here, we investigated correlation between changes in α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR and βArr2 levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of adolescent and adult male rats subjected to maternal separation (MS) and their relationship with anxiety-like behavior in adolescence. MS was performed 3 h per day from postnatal days 2–11 and anxiety-like behavior was evaluated in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests. The protein levels were examined using western blot assay. MS decreased α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR expression and increased βArr2 expression in both brain regions of adolescent rats, while induced reverse changes in adulthood. MS adolescent rats demonstrated higher anxiety-type behavior and lower activity in behavioral tests than controls. Decreased α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR levels in MS adolescence strongly correlated with reduced time spent in the open field central area, consistent with increased anxiety-like behavior. An anxiety-like phenotype was mimicked by acute and chronic treatment of developing rats with prazosin, an α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR antagonist, suggesting α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR downregulation may facilitate anxiety behavior in MS adolescent rats. Together, our results indicate a negative correlation between α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR neurotransmission and βArr2 levels in both adults and anxious-adolescent rats and suggest that increased βArr2 levels may contribute to posttranslational regulation of α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR and modulation of anxiety-like behavior in adolescent rats. This may provide a path to develop more effective anxiolytic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Interspike intervals within retinal spike bursts combinatorially encode multiple stimulus features</title>

Neurons in various regions of the brain generate spike bursts. While the number of spikes within a burst has been shown to carry information, information coding by interspike intervals (ISIs) is less well understood. In particular, a burst with &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; spikes has &lt;i&gt;k−&lt;/i&gt;1 intraburst ISIs, and these &lt;i&gt;k−&lt;/i&gt;1 ISIs could theoretically encode &lt;i&gt;k−&lt;/i&gt;1 independent values. In this study, we demonstrate that such combinatorial coding occurs for retinal bursts. By recording ganglion cell spikes from isolated salamander retinae, we found that intraburst ISIs encode oscillatory light sequences that are much faster than the light intensity modulation encoded by the number of spikes. When a burst has three spikes, the two intraburst ISIs combinatorially encode the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory sequence. Analysis of trial-to-trial variability suggested that intraburst ISIs are regulated by two independent mechanisms responding to orthogonal oscillatory components, one of which is common to bursts with a different number of spikes. Therefore, the retina encodes multiple stimulus features by exploiting all degrees of freedom of burst spike patterns, i.e., the spike number and multiple intraburst ISIs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8_kA1Ixbko&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Maximizing the reusability of gene expression data by predicting missing metadata</title>

Reusability is part of the FAIR data principle, which aims to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. One of the current efforts to increase the reusability of public genomics data has been to focus on the inclusion of quality metadata associated with the data. When necessary metadata are missing, most researchers will consider the data useless. In this study, we developed a framework to predict the missing metadata of gene expression datasets to maximize their reusability. We found that when using predicted data to conduct other analyses, it is not optimal to use all the predicted data. Instead, one should only use the subset of data, which can be predicted accurately. We proposed a new metric called Proportion of Cases Accurately Predicted (PCAP), which is optimized in our specifically-designed machine learning pipeline. The new approach performed better than pipelines using commonly used metrics such as F1-score in terms of maximizing the reusability of data with missing values. We also found that different variables might need to be predicted using different machine learning methods and/or different data processing protocols. Using differential gene expression analysis as an example, we showed that when missing variables are accurately predicted, the corresponding gene expression data can be reliably used in downstream analyses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F6Pjad6S8o0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of coexisting medical conditions, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host protein–protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of &lt;i&gt;ACE2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TMPRSS2&lt;/i&gt; is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including &lt;i&gt;IRAK3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADRB2&lt;/i&gt;). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.91) is significantly associated with a 28% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay. Using a PS matching user active comparator design, we determined that melatonin usage was associated with a reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.90). Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31–0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and various disease comorbidities using PS matching. In summary, this study presents an integrative network medicine platform for predicting disease manifestations associated with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uvpeSBS7OcA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cues of maternal and paternal origins interact to control seed development, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still far from clear. Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;TOPOISOMERASE Iα&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TOP1α&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;UP-FRAMESHIFT SUPPRESSOR 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TTG2&lt;/i&gt;) gametophytically, biparentally regulate seed size in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;TOP1α&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; are mainly expressed in antipodal cells, and loss of their function leads to ectopic &lt;i&gt;TTG2&lt;/i&gt; expression in these female gametophytic cells. We further demonstrate that TOP1α and UPF1 directly repress &lt;i&gt;TTG2&lt;/i&gt; expression through affecting its chromatin status and determine its relative expression in antipodal cells versus sperm cells, which controls seed size in a dosage-dependent and parent-of-origin-dependent manner. The molecular interplay among these three genes explains their biparental gametophytic effect during diploidy and interploidy reciprocal crosses. Taken together, our findings reveal a molecular framework of parental interaction for seed size control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/c7D7CMFvyYo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The brain exhibits widespread endogenous responses in the absence of visual stimuli, even at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing. Such responses have been studied in monkeys using optical imaging with a limited field of view over visual cortex. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) in human participants to study the link between arousal and endogenous responses in visual cortex. The response that we observed was tightly entrained to task timing, was spatially extensive, and was independent of visual stimulation. We found that this response follows dynamics similar to that of pupil size and heart rate, suggesting that task-related activity is related to arousal. Finally, we found that higher reward increased response amplitude while decreasing its trial-to-trial variability (i.e., the noise). Computational simulations suggest that increased temporal precision underlies both of these observations. Our findings are consistent with optical imaging studies in monkeys and support the notion that arousal increases precision of neural activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/v9y0OkBopAc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

There is a great need for antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus (EV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections, which can be severe and occasionally life-threatening. The conserved nonstructural protein 2C, which is an AAA+ ATPase, is a promising target for drug development. Here, we present a structure-activity relationship study of a previously identified compound that targets the 2C protein of EV-A71 and several EV-B species members, but not poliovirus (PV) (EV-C species). This compound is structurally related to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug fluoxetine—which also targets 2C—but has favorable chemical properties. We identified several compounds with increased antiviral potency and broadened activity. Four compounds showed broad-spectrum EV and RV activity and inhibited contemporary strains of emerging EVs of public health concern, including EV-A71, coxsackievirus (CV)-A24v, and EV-D68. Importantly, unlike (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-fluoxetine, these compounds are no longer neuroactive. By raising resistant EV-A71, CV-B3, and EV-D68 variants against one of these inhibitors, we identified novel 2C resistance mutations. Reverse engineering of these mutations revealed a conserved mechanism of resistance development. Resistant viruses first acquired a mutation in, or adjacent to, the α2 helix of 2C. This mutation disrupted compound binding and provided drug resistance, but this was at the cost of viral fitness. Additional mutations at distantly localized 2C residues were then acquired to increase resistance and/or to compensate for the loss of fitness. Using computational methods to identify solvent accessible tunnels near the α2 helix in the EV-A71 and PV 2C crystal structures, a conserved binding pocket of the inhibitors is proposed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GgWFfF1rxno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-cell imaging, combined with recent advances in image analysis and microfluidic technologies, have enabled fundamental discoveries of cellular responses to chemical perturbations that are often obscured by traditional liquid-culture experiments. Temperature is an environmental variable well known to impact growth and to elicit specific stress responses at extreme values; it is often used as a genetic tool to interrogate essential genes. However, the dynamic effects of temperature shifts have remained mostly unstudied at the single-cell level, due largely to engineering challenges related to sample stability, heatsink considerations, and temperature measurement and feedback. Additionally, the few commercially available temperature-control platforms are costly. Here, we report an inexpensive (&amp;lt;$110) and modular Single-Cell Temperature Controller (SiCTeC) device for microbial imaging—based on straightforward modifications of the typical slide-sample-coverslip approach to microbial imaging—that controls temperature using a ring-shaped Peltier module and microcontroller feedback. Through stable and precise (±0.15°C) temperature control, SiCTeC achieves reproducible and fast (1–2 min) temperature transitions with programmable waveforms between room temperature and 45°C with an air objective. At the device’s maximum temperature of 89°C, SiCTeC revealed that &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells progressively shrink and lose cellular contents. During oscillations between 30°C and 37°C, cells rapidly adapted their response to temperature upshifts. Furthermore, SiCTeC enabled the discovery of rapid morphological changes and enhanced sensitivity to substrate stiffness during upshifts to nonpermissive temperatures in temperature-sensitive mutants of cell-wall synthesis enzymes. Overall, the simplicity and affordability of SiCTeC empowers future studies of the temperature dependence of single-cell physiology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HHvrzfx-gmo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Influence of autapses on synchronisation in neural networks with chemical synapse. (arXiv:2011.03019v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A great deal of research has been devoted on the investigation of neural
dynamics in various network topologies. However, only a few studies have
focused on the influence of autapses, synapses from a neuron onto itself via
closed loops, on neural synchronisation. Here, we build a random network with
adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons coupled with chemical synapses,
equipped with autapses, to study the effect of the latter on synchronous
behaviour. We consider time delay in the conductance of the pre-synaptic neuron
for excitatory and inhibitory connections. Interestingly, in neural networks
consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we uncover that
synchronous behaviour depends on their synapse type. Our results provide
evidence on the synchronous and desynchronous activities that emerge in random
neural networks with chemical, inhibitory and excitatory synapses where neurons
are equipped with autapses.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Low-Complexity Models for Acoustic Scene Classification Based on Receptive Field Regularization and Frequency Damping. (arXiv:2011.02955v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02955</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks are known to be very demanding in terms of computing and
memory requirements. Due to the ever increasing use of embedded systems and
mobile devices with a limited resource budget, designing low-complexity models
without sacrificing too much of their predictive performance gained great
importance. In this work, we investigate and compare several well-known methods
to reduce the number of parameters in neural networks. We further put these
into the context of a recent study on the effect of the Receptive Field (RF) on
a model's performance, and empirically show that we can achieve high-performing
low-complexity models by applying specific restrictions on the RFs, in
combination with parameter reduction methods. Additionally, we propose a
filter-damping technique for regularizing the RF of models, without altering
their architecture and changing their parameter counts. We will show that
incorporating this technique improves the performance in various low-complexity
settings such as pruning and decomposed convolution. Using our proposed filter
damping, we achieved the 1st rank at the DCASE-2020 Challenge in the task of
Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Sex Differences in Vagus Nerve Stimulation Effects on Rat Cardiovascular and Immune Systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.560668</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Investigations into the benefits of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) through pre-clinical and clinical research have led to promising findings for treating several disorders. Despite proven effectiveness of VNS on conditions such as epilepsy and depression, understanding of off-target effects and contributing factors such as sex differences can be beneficial to optimize therapy design.&lt;/p&gt;New Methods&lt;p&gt;In this article, we assessed longitudinal effects of VNS on cardiovascular and immune systems, and studied potential sex differences using a rat model of long-term VNS. Rats were implanted with cuff electrodes around the left cervical vagus nerve for VNS, and wireless physiological monitoring devices for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular system using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. ECG morphology and heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted to assess cardiovascular changes resulting from VNS in short-term and long-term timescales. We also assessed VNS effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines in blood during the course of the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed to compare results between Treatment and Sham groups, and between male and female animals from Treatment and Sham groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Considerable differences between male and female rats in cardiovascular effects of VNS were observed in multiple cardiovascular features. However, the effects seemed to be transient with approximately 1-h recovery after VNS. While short-term cardiovascular effects were mainly observed in male rats, females in general showed more significant long-term effects even after VNS stopped. We did not observe notable changes or sex differences in systemic cytokine levels resulting from VNS.&lt;/p&gt;Comparison With Existing Methods&lt;p&gt;Compared to existing methods, our study design incorporated wireless physiological monitoring and systemic blood cytokine level analysis, along with long-term VNS experiments in unanesthetized rats to study sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The contribution of sex differences for long-term VNS off-target effects on cardiovascular and immune systems was assessed using awake behaving rats. Although VNS did not change the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers in systemic circulation for male and female rats, we observed significant differences in cardiovascular effects of VNS characterized using ECG morphology and HRV analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Performance Improvement for Detecting Brain Function Using fNIRS: A Multi-Distance Probe Configuration With PPL Method</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569508</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569508</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To improve the spatial resolution of imaging and get more effective brain function information, a multi-distance probe configuration with three distances (28.2, 40, and 44.7 mm) and 52 channels is designed. At the same time, a data conversion method of modified Beer–Lambert law (MBLL) with partial pathlength (PPL) is proposed. In the experiment, three kinds of tasks, grip of left hand, grip of right hand, and rest, are performed with eight healthy subjects. First, with a typical single-distance probe configuration (30 mm, 24 channels), the feasibility of the proposed MBLL with PPL is preliminarily validated. Further, the characteristic of the proposed method is evaluated with the multi-distance probe configuration. Compared with MBLL with differential pathlength factor (DPF), the proposed MBLL with PPL is able to acquire more obvious concentration change and can achieve higher classification accuracy of the three tasks. Then, with the proposed method, the performance of the multi-distance probe configuration is discussed. Results show that, compared with a single distance, the combination of the three distances has better spatial resolution and could explore more accurate brain activation information. Besides, the classification accuracy of the three tasks obtained with the combination of three distances is higher than that of any combination of two distances. Also, with the combination of the three distances, the two-class classification between different tasks is carried out. Both theory and experimental results demonstrate that, using multi-distance probe configuration and the MBLL with PPL method, the performance of brain function detected by NIRS can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association of Genes Involved in the Metabolic Pathways of Amyloid-β and Tau Proteins With Sporadic Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease in the Southern Han Chinese Population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584801</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584801</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The genes involved in the metabolic pathways of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins significantly influence the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Various studies have explored the associations between some of these genes and AD in the Caucasian population; however, researches regarding these associations remain limited in the Chinese population. To systematically evaluate the associations of these genes with AD, we investigated 19 genes involved in the metabolism of Aβ and tau based on previous studies selected using the PubMed database. This study included 372 patients with sporadic late-onset AD (sLOAD) and 345 cognitively healthy individuals from southern China. The results were replicated in the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP). Protein–protein interactions were determined using the STRING v11 database. We found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs11682128, of BIN1 conferred susceptibility to sLOAD after adjusting for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status and performing the Bonferroni correction {corrected P = 0.000153, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.403 (1.079–1.824)}, which was replicated in the IGAP. Protein–protein interactions indicated that BIN1 was correlated with MAPT. Moreover, rare variants of NEP and FERMT2 (0.0026 &amp;lt; corrected P &amp;lt; 0.05), and the Aβ degradation, tau pathology, and tau phosphatase pathways (0.01 &amp;lt; corrected P &amp;lt; 0.05), were nominally significantly associated with sLOAD. This study suggested that the genes involved in the metabolic pathways of Aβ and tau contributed to the etiology of sLOAD in the southern Han Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Modulation of flight and feeding behaviours requires presynaptic IP3Rs in dopaminergic neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62297</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62297</link>
	<description>Innate behaviours, although robust and hard wired, rely on modulation of neuronal circuits, for eliciting an appropriate response according to internal states and external cues. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight is one such innate behaviour that is modulated by intracellular calcium release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Cellular mechanism(s) by which IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs modulate neuronal function for specific behaviours remain speculative, in vertebrates and invertebrates. To address this, we generated an inducible dominant negative form of the IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;DN&lt;/sup&gt;). Flies with neuronal expression of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;DN&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit flight deficits. Expression of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;DN&lt;/sup&gt; helped identify key flight-modulating dopaminergic neurons with axonal projections in the mushroom body. Flies with attenuated IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in these presynaptic dopaminergic neurons exhibit shortened flight bouts and a disinterest in seeking food, accompanied by reduced excitability and dopamine release upon cholinergic stimulation. Our findings suggest that the same neural circuit modulates the drive for food search and for undertaking longer flight bouts.</description>

	<title>eLife: Sustained TNF-α stimulation induces transcriptional memory that greatly enhances signal sensitivity and robustness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61965</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61965</link>
	<description>Transcriptional memory allows certain genes to respond to previously experienced signals more robustly. However, whether and how the key proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α mediates transcriptional memory are poorly understood. Using HEK293F cells as a model system, we report that sustained TNF-α stimulation induces transcriptional memory dependent on TET enzymes. The hypomethylated status of transcriptional regulatory regions can be inherited, facilitating NF-κB binding and more robust subsequent activation. A high initial methylation level and CpG density around κB sites are correlated with the functional potential of transcriptional memory modules. Interestingly, the &lt;i&gt;CALCB&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the proven migraine therapeutic target CGRP, exhibits the best transcriptional memory. A neighboring primate-specific endogenous retrovirus stimulates more rapid, more strong and at least 100-fold more sensitive &lt;i&gt;CALCB&lt;/i&gt; induction in subsequent TNF-α stimulation. Our study reveals that TNF-α-mediated transcriptional memory is governed by active DNA demethylation and greatly sensitizes memory genes to much lower doses of inflammatory cues.</description>

	<title>eLife: Molecular evidence of hybridization between pig and human Ascaris indicates an interbred species complex infecting humans</title>

	<description>Human ascariasis is a major neglected tropical disease caused by the nematode &lt;i&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/i&gt;. We report a 296 megabase (Mb) reference-quality genome comprised of 17,902 protein-coding genes derived from a single, representative &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; worm. An additional 68 worms were collected from 60 human hosts in Kenyan villages where pig husbandry is rare. Notably, the majority of these worms (63/68) possessed mitochondrial genomes that clustered closer to the pig parasite &lt;i&gt;Ascaris suum&lt;/i&gt; than to &lt;i&gt;A. lumbricoides&lt;/i&gt;. Comparative phylogenomic analyses identified over 11 million nuclear-encoded SNPs but just two distinct genetic types that had recombined across the genomes analyzed. The nuclear genomes had extensive heterozygosity, and all samples existed as genetic mosaics with either &lt;i&gt;A. suum&lt;/i&gt;-like or &lt;i&gt;A. lumbricoides&lt;/i&gt;-like inheritance patterns supporting a highly interbred &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; species genetic complex. As no barriers appear to exist for anthroponotic transmission of these ‘hybrid’ worms, a one-health approach to control the spread of human ascariasis will be necessary.</description>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; possesses a large number of genes of unknown or predicted function, undermining fundamental understanding of pathogenicity and drug susceptibility. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput functional genomics approach combining inducible CRISPR-interference and image-based analyses of morphological features and sub-cellular chromosomal localizations in the related non-pathogen, &lt;i&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/i&gt;. Applying automated imaging and analysis to 263 essential gene knockdown mutants in an arrayed library, we derive robust, quantitative descriptions of bacillary morphologies consequent on gene silencing. Leveraging statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to inform investigations of gene function. Exploiting this observation, we infer the existence of a mycobacterial restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation. Our results support the application of large-scale image-based analyses for mycobacterial functional genomics, simultaneously establishing the utility of this approach for drug mechanism-of-action studies.</description>

	<description>Widefield fluorescence microscopy is used to monitor the spiking of populations of neurons in the brain. Widefield fluorescence can originate from indicator molecules at all depths in cortex and the relative contributions from somata, dendrites, and axons are often unknown. Here, I simulate widefield illumination and fluorescence collection and determine the main sources of fluorescence for several GCaMP mouse lines. Scattering strongly affects illumination and collection. One consequence is that illumination intensity is greatest ~300–400 µm below the pia, not at the brain surface. Another is that fluorescence from a source deep in cortex may extend across a diameter of 3–4 mm at the brain surface, severely limiting lateral resolution. In many mouse lines, the volume of tissue contributing to fluorescence extends through the full depth of cortex and fluorescence at most surface locations is a weighted average across multiple cortical columns and often more than one cortical area.</description>

	<description>Glutamate transporters are essential players in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain, where they maintain extracellular glutamate below cytotoxic levels and allow for rounds of transmission. The structural bases of their function are well established, particularly within a model archaeal homologue, sodium and aspartate symporter Glt&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the mechanism of gating on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane remains ambiguous. We report Cryo-EM structures of Glt&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt; reconstituted into nanodiscs, including those structurally constrained in the cytoplasm-facing state and either apo, bound to sodium ions only, substrate, or blockers. The structures show that both substrate translocation and release involve movements of the bulky transport domain through the lipid bilayer. They further reveal a novel mode of inhibitor binding and show how solutes release is coupled to protein conformational changes. Finally, we describe how domain movements are associated with the displacement of bound lipids and significant membrane deformations, highlighting the potential regulatory role of the bilayer.</description>

	<title>eLife: Altered hippocampal-prefrontal communication during anxiety-related avoidance in mice deficient for the autism-associated gene Pogz</title>

	<description>Many genes have been linked to autism. However, it remains unclear what long-term changes in neural circuitry result from disruptions in these genes, and how these circuit changes might contribute to abnormal behaviors. To address these questions, we studied behavior and physiology in mice heterozygous for &lt;i&gt;Pogz&lt;/i&gt;, a high confidence autism gene. &lt;i&gt;Pogz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit reduced anxiety-related avoidance in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Theta-frequency communication between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be necessary for normal avoidance in the EPM. We found deficient theta-frequency synchronization between the vHPC and mPFC &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. When we examined vHPC-mPFC communication at higher resolution, vHPC input onto prefrontal GABAergic interneurons was specifically disrupted, whereas input onto pyramidal neurons remained intact. These findings illustrate how the loss of a high confidence autism gene can impair long-range communication by causing inhibitory circuit dysfunction within pathways important for specific behaviors.</description>

	<description>To comprehensively investigate the white matter (WM) features of cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia, and further assess the correlation between altered WM features and clinical and cognitive assessments. Forty-two patients and fifty-two matched healthy controls (HCs) of the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Data Exchange tool were involved in this study. The cerebellar WM volume was calculated by voxel-based morphometry. And tract-based spatial statistics was used to analysis the diffusion changes in patients when compared to HCs. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between altered imaging feature and clinical, cognitive assessments. Compared to HCs, the schizophrenia patients did not reveal difference in cerebellar WM volume and schizophrenia patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in left middle cerebellar peduncles and inferior cerebellar peduncles in voxel-wise but not in tract-wise. Critically, these cerebellar changes were associated with disease duration in schizophrenia patients. And significant correlation between the altered cerebellar WM features and cognitive assessments only revealed in HCs but disrupted in schizophrenia patients. The present findings suggested that the voxel-wise WM integrity analysis might was the more sensitive way to investigate the structural abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Middle cerebellar peduncles and inferior cerebellar peduncles may be a crucial neurobiological substrate of cognition and thus might be regarded as a biomarker for treatment.</description>

	<description>Efficient search in enormous combinatorial spaces is an essential component of intelligence. Humans, for instance, are often found searching for optimal action sequences, linguistic structures and causal explanations. Is there any computational domain that provides good-enough and fast-enough solutions to such a diverse set of problems, yet can be robustly implemented over neural substrates? Based on previous accounts, we propose that a Darwinian process, operating over sequential cycles of imperfect copying and selection of informational patterns, is a promising candidate. It is, in effect, a stochastic parallel search that i) does not need local gradient-like information and ii) redistributes its computational resources from globally bad to globally good solution candidates automatically. Here we demonstrate these concepts in a proof-of-principle model based on dynamical output states of reservoir computers as units of evolution. We show that a population of reservoir computing units, arranged in one or two-dimensional topologies, is capable of maintaining and continually improving upon existing solutions over rugged combinatorial reward landscapes. We also provide a detailed analysis of how neural quantities, such as noise and topology, translate to evolutionary ones, such as mutation rate and population structure. We demonstrate the existence of a sharp error threshold, a neural noise level beyond which information accumulated by an evolutionary process cannot be maintained. We point at the importance of neural representation, akin to genotype-phenotype maps, in determining the efficiency of any evolutionary search in the brain. Novel analysis methods are developed, including neural firing pattern phylogenies that display the unfolding of the process.</description>

	<description>INTRODUCTION: Genetic, animal and epidemiological studies involving biomolecular and clinical endophenotypes implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide a novel approach to assess biological pathway-associated disease risk by combining the effects of variation at multiple, functionally related genes. METHODS: We investigated associations of PRS for genes involved in 12 mitochondrial pathways (pathway-PRS) related to AD in 854 participants from Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. RESULTS: Pathway-PRS for four mitochondrial pathways are significantly associated with increased AD risk: (i) response to oxidative stress (OR: 2.01 [95% Cl: 1.71, 2.37]); (ii) mitochondrial transport (OR: 1.81 [95% Cl: 1.55, 2.13]); (iii) hallmark oxidative phosphorylation (OR: 1.23 [95% Cl: 1.07, 1.41]); and (iv) mitochondrial membrane potential regulation (OR: 1.18 [95% Cl: 1.03, 1.36]). DISCUSSION: Therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways may have potential for modifying AD pathogenesis. Further investigation is required to establish a causal role for these pathways in AD pathology.</description>

	<description>Aging is characterized by a decline of cognitive control. In semantic cognition, this leads to the paradox that older adults usually show poorer task performance than young adults despite their greater semantic knowledge. So far, the underlying neural changes of these behavioral differences are poorly understood. In the current neuroimaging study, we investigated the interplay of domain-specific and domain-general networks in young and older adults during a verbal semantic fluency task. In both age groups, task processing was characterized by a strong interaction between the domain-general multiple-demand and the default mode system during semantic fluency. However, the behavioral relevance of strengthened connectivity differed between groups: While within- and between-network functional connectivity predicted better performance in young adults, these increases were associated with a performance decline in older adults. Our findings lend novel support to the notion of reduced efficiency in the aging brain, due to neural dedifferentiation in semantic cognition.</description>

	<description>Speed and trajectory of locomotion are characteristic traits of individual species. During evolution, locomotion kinematics is likely to have been tuned for survival in the habitats of each species. Although kinematics of locomotion is thought to be influenced by habitats, the quantitative relation between the kinematics and environmental factors has not been fully revealed. Here, we performed comparative analyses of larval locomotion in 11 Drosophila species. We found that larval locomotion kinematics are divergent among the species. The diversity is not correlated to the body length but is correlated instead to the minimum habitat temperature of the species. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference suggest that the evolutionary rate of the kinematics is diverse among phylogenetic trees. The results of this study imply that the kinematics of larval locomotion has diverged in the evolutionary history of the genus Drosophila and evolved under the effects of the minimum ambient temperature of habitats.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Decomposing the role of alpha oscillations during brain maturation</title>

	<description>During childhood and adolescence, the human brain undergoes various micro- and macroscopic changes. Understanding the neurophysiological changes within this reorganizational process is crucial, as many major psychiatric disorders emerge during this critical phase of life. In electroencephalography (EEG), a widely studied signal component are alpha oscillations (~8-13 Hz), which have been linked to developmental changes throughout the lifespan. Previous neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an increase of the alpha peak frequency and a decrease of alpha power to be related to brain maturation. The latter results have been questioned by recent developments in EEG signal processing techniques, as it could be demonstrated that aperiodic (non-oscillatory) components in the EEG signal conflate findings on periodic (oscillatory) changes, and thus need to be decomposed accordingly. We therefore analyzed a large, openly available pediatric dataset of 1485 children and adolescents in the age range of 5 to 21 years, in order to clarify the role of alpha oscillations and aperiodic signal components in this period of life. We first replicated previous findings of an increase of alpha peak frequency with age. Our results further suggest that alpha oscillatory power decreases with increasing age, however, when controlling for the aperiodic signal component, this effect inverted such as the aperiodic adjusted alpha power parameters significantly increase with advanced brain maturation, while the aperiodic signal component flattens and its offset decreases. Thus, interpretations of these oscillatory changes should be done with caution and incorporate changes in the aperiodic signal. These findings highlight the importance of taking aperiodic signal components into account when investigating age related changes of EEG spectral power parameters.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Congruent lip movements facilitate speech processing in a dynamic audiovisual multi-talker scenario: An ERP study with older and younger adults</title>

	<description>In natural conversations, visible mouth and lip movements play an important role in speech comprehension. There is evidence that visual speech information improves speech comprehension, especially for older adults and under difficult listening conditions. However, the neurocognitive basis is still poorly understood. The present EEG experiment investigated the benefits of audiovisual speech in a dynamic cocktail-party scenario with 22 (aged 20 to 34 years) younger and 20 (aged 55 to 74 years) older participants. We presented three simultaneously talking faces with a varying amount of visual speech input (still faces, visually unspecific and audiovisually congruent). In a two-alternative forced-choice task, participants had to discriminate target words (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;) among two distractors (one-digit number words). In half of the experimental blocks, the target was always presented from a central position, in the other half, occasional switches to a lateral position could occur. We investigated behavioral and electrophysiological modulations due to age, location switches and the content of visual information, analyzing response times and accuracy as well as the P1, N1, P2, N2 event-related potentials (ERPs) and the contingent negative variation (CNV) in the EEG. We found that audiovisually congruent speech information improved performance and modulated ERP amplitudes in both age groups, suggesting enhanced preparation and integration of the subsequent auditory input. However, these benefits were only observed as long as no location switches occurred. To conclude, meaningful visual information in a multi-talker setting, when presented from the expected location, is shown to be beneficial for both younger and older adults.</description>

	<description>Humans and other animals have evolved to act in groups, but how does the brain distinguish multiple people moving in group from multiple people moving independently? Across three experiments, we test whether biological motion perception depends on the spatiotemporal relationships among people moving together. In Experiment 1, we apply EEG frequency tagging to apparent biological motion and show that fluently ordered sequences of body postures drive brain activity at three hierarchical levels of biological motion processing: image, body sequence, and movement. We then show that movement-, but not body- or image-related brain responses are enhanced when observing four agents moving in synchrony. Neural entrainment was strongest for fluently moving synchronous groups (Experiment 2), displayed in upright orientation (Experiment 3). Our findings show that the brain preferentially entrains to the collective movement of human agents, deploying perceptual organization principles of synchrony and common fate for the purpose of social perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Insula cortex gates the interplay of action observation and preparation for controlled imitation</title>

	<description>Perceiving, anticipating and responding to the actions of another person are fundamentally entwined processes such that seeing another's movement can prompt automatic imitation, as in social mimicry and contagious yawning. Yet the direct-matching of others' movements is not always appropriate, so this tendency must be controlled. This necessitates the hierarchical integration of the systems for action mirroring with domain-general control networks. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modelling to examine the top-down and context-dependent modulation of mirror representations and their influence on motor planning. Participants performed actions that either intentionally or incidentally imitated, or counter-imitated, an observed action. Analyses of these fMRI data revealed a region in the mid-occipital gyrus (MOG) where activity differed between imitation versus counter-imitation in a manner that depended on whether this was intentional or incidental. To identify broader cortical network mechanisms underlying this interaction between intention and imitativeness, we used dynamic causal modelling to pose specific hypotheses which embody assumptions about inter-areal interactions and contextual modulations. These models each incorporated four regions: medial temporal V5 (early motion perception), MOG (action-observation), supplementary motor area (action planning), and anterior insula (executive control); but differ in their interactions and hierarchical structure. The best model of our data afforded a crucial role for the anterior insula, gating the interaction of supplementary motor area and MOG activity. This provides a novel brain network-based account of task-dependent control over the integration of motor planning and mirror systems, with mirror responses suppressed for intentional counter-imitation.</description>

	<description>When performing a physically demanding behavior, sometimes the optimal choice is to quit the behavior rather than persist and waste time and energy. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), consisting of the anterior cingulate cortex and secondary motor area, likely contributes towards such utility assessments. Here, we examined how rodent dmPFC single unit and ensemble level activity corresponded to changes in motivation and quitting in an effortful weight lifting task. Rats carried out two task paradigms: one that became progressively more physically demanding over time and a second fixed effort version. Rats could quit the task at any time. Dorsomedial PFC neurons were highly responsive to each behavioral stage of the task, consisting of rope pulling, reward retrieval, and reward area leaving. Activity was highest early in sessions, commensurate with the highest relative task utility, then decreased until the point of quitting. Neural ensembles showed stable task representations across the entirety of sessions. However, these representations drifted and became more distinct over the course of the session. These results suggest that dmPFC neurons represent behavioral states that are dynamically modified as behaviors lose their utility, culminating in task quitting.</description>

	<description>A central question in neuroscience is how context changes perception of sensory stimuli. In the olfactory system, for example, experiments show that task demands can drive merging and separation of cortical odor responses, which underpin olfactory generalization and discrimination. Here, we propose a simple statistical mechanism for this effect, based on unstructured feedback from the central brain to the olfactory bulb, representing the context associated with an odor, and sufficiently selective cortical gating of sensory inputs. Strikingly, the model predicts that both pattern separation and completion should increase when odors are initially more similar, an effect reported in recent experiments. The theory predicts reversals of these trends following experimental manipulations and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease that increase cortical excitability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A longitudinal analysis of puberty-related cortical development</title>

	<description>The brain undergoes extensive structural changes during adolescence, concurrent to puberty-related physical and hormonal changes. While animal research suggests these biological processes are related to one another, our knowledge of brain development in humans is largely based on age-related processes. Thus, the current study characterized puberty-related changes in human brain structure, by combining data from two longitudinal neuroimaging cohorts. Beyond normative changes in cortical thickness, we examined whether individual differences in the rate of pubertal maturation (or &quot;pubertal tempo&quot;) was associated with variations in cortical trajectories. Participants (N = 192; scans = 366) completed up to three waves of MRI assessments between 8.5 and 14.5 years of age, as well as questionnaire assessments of pubertal stage at each wave. Generalized additive mixture models were used to characterize trajectories of cortical development. Results revealed widespread linear puberty-related changes across much of the cortex. Many of these changes, particularly within the frontal and parietal cortices, were independent of age-related development. Males exhibiting faster pubertal tempo demonstrated greater thinning in the precuneus and frontal cortices than same-aged and -sex peers. Findings suggest that the unique influence of puberty on cortical development may be more extensive than previously identified, and also emphasize important individual differences in the coupling of these developmental processes.</description>

	<description>Motion relations in visual scenes carry an abundance of behaviorally relevant information, but little is known about the computations underlying the identification of visual motion structure by humans. We addressed this gap in two psychophysics experiments and found that participants identified hierarchically organized motion relations in close correspondence with Bayesian structural inference. We demonstrate that, for our tasks, a choice model based on the Bayesian ideal observer can accurately match many facets of human structural inference, including task performance, perceptual error patterns, single-trial responses, participant-specific differences, and subjective decision confidence, particularly when motion scenes are ambiguous. Our work can guide future neuroscience experiments to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying higher-level visual motion perception.</description>

	<description>The visual field region where a stimulus evokes a neural response is called the receptive field (RF). Analytical tools combined with functional MRI can estimate the receptive field of the population of neurons within a voxel. These population RF (pRF) methods accurately specify the central position of the pRF and provide some information about the spatial extent (size) of the receptive field. A number of investigators developed methods to further estimate the shape of the pRF, for example whether the shape is more circular or elliptical. This journal published a report that there are many pRFs with highly elliptical pRFs in early visual cortex (V1-V3; Silson et al., 2018). Such a large aspect ratio is difficult to reconcile with the spatial scale of orientation columns or visual field maps in early visual cortex. We started to replicate the experiments using their methods and found that the software used in the publication does not accurately estimate RF shape: it produces elliptical fits to circular ground-truth data. We analyzed an independent data set with a different software package that was validated over a specific range of measurement conditions. Our analysis of pRF elliptical fits show that in early visual cortex the aspect ratios are less than 2 and potentially consistent with nearly circular shapes. Furthermore, current empirical and theoretical methods do not have enough precision to discriminate ellipses with aspect ratios of 1.5 from circles (aspect ratio of 1). Through simulation we identify methods for improving sensitivity that may estimate ellipses with smaller aspect ratios. The results we present are quantitatively consistent with assessments using several other methodologies (Greene et al., 2014; Zeidman et al., 2018; Merkel et al., 2020).</description>

	<description>Mutations in genes encoding the human brain-expressed voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 are associated with a variety of human diseases including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, familial migraine, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. A major obstacle hindering investigations of the functional consequences of brain NaV channel mutations is an unexplained instability of the corresponding recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) when propagated in commonly used bacterial strains manifested by high spontaneous rates of mutation. Here we investigated the cause for instability of human NaV1.1 cDNA. We identified cryptic prokaryotic promoter-like elements that are presumed to drive transcription of translationally toxic mRNAs in bacteria as the cause of the instability, and demonstrated that mutations in these elements can mitigate the instability. Extending these observations, we generated full-length human NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 plasmids using one or two introns that interrupt the cryptic reading frames along with a minimum number of silent nucleotide changes that achieved stable propagation in bacteria. Expression of the stabilized sequences in cultured mammalian cells resulted in functional NaV channels with properties that matched their parental constructs. Our findings explain a widely observed instability of recombinant neuronal human NaV channels, and we describe re-engineered plasmids that attenuate this problem.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Selective co-activation of α7- and α4β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors reverses beta-amyloid-induced synaptic dysfunction</title>

	<description>Beta-amyloid (A{beta}) has been recognized as an early trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) leading to synaptic and cognitive impairments. A{beta} can alter neuronal signaling through interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), contributing to synaptic dysfunction in AD. The three major nAChR subtypes in the hippocampus are composed of 7-, 4{beta}2-, and 3{beta}4-nAChRs. A selectively affects 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs, but not 3{beta}4-nAChRs in hippocampal neurons, resulting inneuronal hyperexcitation. However, how nAChR subtype selectivity for A{beta} affects synaptic function in AD is not completely understood. Here, we showed that A{beta} associated with 7- and 4-containing nAChRs but not 3-containing receptors. Computational modeling suggested two amino acids in 7-nAChRs, Arginine 208 and Glutamate 211, were important for the interaction between A{beta} and 7-containing nAChRs. These residues were found to be conserved only in the 7 and 4 subunits. We therefore mutated these amino acids in 7-containing nAChRs to mimic the 3 subunit and found that mutant 7-containing receptors were unable to interact with A{beta}, providing direct molecular evidence for how A{beta} selectively interacted with 7- and 4-containing receptors, but not 3-containing nAChRs. Selective co-activation of 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs was also sufficient to reverse A{beta}-induced AMPA receptor (AMPAR) dysfunction, including A{beta}-induced reduction of AMPAR phosphorylation and surface expression in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, the A{beta}-induced disruption of long-term potentiation was reversed by co-stimulation of 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs. These findings support a novel mechanism for A{beta}'s impact on synaptic function in AD, namely the differential regulation of nAChR subtypes.</description>

	<description>The relation between a continuous ongoing stimulus and the brain response that it evokes can be characterized by a stimulus-response model fit to the data. This systems-identification approach offers insight into perceptual processes within the brain, and it is also of potential practical use for devices such as Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). The quality of the model can be quantified by measuring the fit with a regression problem, or by applying it to a classification task and measuring its performance. Here we focus on a {em match-mismatch} task that entails deciding whether a segment of brain signal matches, via a model, the auditory stimulus that evoked it. The match-mismatch task can be used to compare performance of different stimulus-response models. We show that performance in a match-mismatch task and metrics summarizing regression accuracies can provide complementary insights in the relation between stimulus and response. Importantly, the match-mismatch task provides information about discriminatory power, making it directly applicable to BCI applications. Evaluation is performed on a freely available database, and code is available for scripts and functions to allow scrutiny of our results and facilitate comparative evaluation of future developments.</description>

	<description>Recent studies examine the behavioral capacities of rats and mice with and without visual input, and the neuronal mechanisms underlying such capacities. These animals are assumed to be functionally blind under red light, perhaps originating in the fact that they are dichromats who possess ultraviolet and green but not red cones. But the inability to see red as a color does not necessarily rule out form vision based on red light absorption through their rod-dominated retina. We measured Long-Evans rats' capacity for visual form discrimination under red light of various wavelength bands. Upon viewing a black and white grating, they had to distinguish between two categories of orientation, horizontal and vertical. Psychometric curves plotting judged orientation versus angle demonstrate the conserved visual capacity of rats under red light. Investigations aiming to explore rodent physiological and behavioral functions in the absence of visual input should not assume red-light blindness.</description>

	<description>The activity of a neural population encodes information about the stimulus that caused it, and decoding population activity reveals how neural circuits process that information. Correlations between neurons strongly impact both encoding and decoding, yet we still lack models that simultaneously capture stimulus encoding by large populations of correlated neurons and allow for accurate decoding of stimulus information, thus limiting our quantitative understanding of the neural code. To address this, we propose a class of models of large-scale population activity based on the theory of exponential family distributions. We apply our models to macaque primary visual cortex (V1) recordings, and show they capture a wide range of response statistics, facilitate accurate Bayesian decoding, and provide interpretable representations of fundamental properties of the neural code. Ultimately, our framework could allow researchers to quantitatively validate predictions of theories of neural coding against both large-scale response recordings and cognitive performance.</description>

	<description>Attributing outcomes to your own actions or to external causes is essential for appropriately learning which actions lead to reward and which actions do not. Our previous work showed that this type of credit assignment is best explained by a Bayesian reinforcement learning model which posits that beliefs about the causal structure of the environment modulate reward prediction errors (RPEs) during action value updating. In this study, we investigated the neural circuits underlying reinforcement learning that are influenced by causal beliefs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while human participants (N = 31; 13 males, 18 females) completed a behavioral task that manipulated beliefs about causal structure. We found evidence that RPEs modulated by causal beliefs are represented in posterior putamen, while standard (unmodulated) RPEs are represented in ventral striatum. Further analyses revealed that beliefs about causal structure are represented in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, structural equation modeling revealed effective connectivity from anterior insula to posterior putamen. Together, these results are consistent with a neural architecture in which causal beliefs in anterior insula are integrated with prediction error signals in posterior putamen to update action values.</description>

	<description>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by any neuronal cells in the central nervous system (CNS) for molecular clearance, cellular communications and disease spread in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease (AD), although their exact molecular mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesize that high-resolution proteomic profiling of EVs separated from animal models of AD would determine the composition of EV contents and their cellular origin. Here, we examined recently developed transgenic mice (CAST.APP/PS1), which express familial AD-linked mutations of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the CAST/EiJ mouse strain and develop hippocampal neurodegeneration. Quantitative proteomics analysis of EVs separated from CAST.APP/PS1 and age-matched control mice by tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry identified a total of 3,444 unique proteins, which are enriched in neuron, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and microglia-specific molecules. CAST.APP/PS1-derived EVs show significant enrichment of Psen1, APP, Itgax, and reduction of Wdr61, Pmpca, Aldh1a2, Calu, Anp32b, Actn4 and Ndufv2 compared to WT-derived EVs, suggesting the involvement of Ab-processing complex and disease-associated / neurodegenerative microglia (DAM/MGnD) in EV secretion. In addition, Itgax and Apoe, the DAM/MGnD markers, in EV show a positive correlation with Itgax and Apoe mRNA expression from brain tissue in CAST.APP/PS1 mice. These datasets indicate the significant contribution of Ab plaque and neurodegeneration-induced DAM/MGnD microglia for EV secretion in CAST.APP/PS1 mice and shed light on understanding the AD pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: PIPPET: A Bayesian framework for generalized entrainment to stochastic rhythms</title>

	<description>When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a &quot;beat&quot;), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Here we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is most naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We formalize this problem as a case of inferring a distribution on a hidden state from point process data in continuous time: either Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing (PIPPET) or Phase And Tempo Inference (PATIPPET). This approach to rhythm tracking generalizes to non-isochronous and multi-voice rhythms. We demonstrate that these inference problems can be approximately solved using a variational Bayesian method that generalizes the Kalman-Bucy filter to point-process data. These solutions reproduce multiple characteristics of overt and covert human rhythm tracking, including period-dependent phase corrections, illusory contraction of unexpectedly empty intervals, and failure to track excessively syncopated rhythms, and could could be plausibly approximated in the brain. PIPPET can serve as the basis for models of performance on a wide range of timing and entrainment tasks and opens the door to even richer predictive processing and active inference models of rhythmic timing.</description>

	<description>Parkinson's disease is characterised by the degeneration of A9 dopaminergic neurons and the pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein. In a patient-derived stem cell model, we have generated dopaminergic neurons from an individual harbouring the p.A30P SNCA mutation and compared those neurons against gene-corrected isogenic control cell lines. We have used confocal microscopy to assess the neuronal network, specifically segmenting dopaminergic neurons and have identified image-based phenotypes showing axonal impairment and reduced neurite branching. We show using multi-electrode array (MEA) technology that the neurons carrying the endogenous p.A30P alpha-synuclein mutation are functionally impaired and identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a pathogenic cellular phenotype. We report that against gene-corrected isogenic control cell lines the neurons carrying the p.A30P SNCA mutation have a deficit and are susceptible to the mitochondrial toxin and environmental pesticide Rotenone. Our data supports the use of isogenic cell lines in identifying image-based pathological phenotypes that can serve as an entry point for future disease modifying compound screenings and drug discovery strategies.</description>

	<description>Abundant anatomical and physiological evidence supports the presence of at least three distinct types of relay glutamatergic neurons in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, the brain region that conveys visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Relay neuron diversity has also been described in the mouse dLGN (also known as LGd). Different types of relay neurons in mice, humans and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to other cellular properties and differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of relay neurons in the primate dLGN, magnocellular neurons, parvocellular neurons, and two cell types expressing canonical marker genes for koniocellular neurons. Surprisingly, despite extensive documented morphological and physiological differences between magno- and parvocellular neurons, we identified few genes with significantly differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. We also detected strong donor-specific gene expression signatures in both macaque and human relay neurons. Likewise, the dominant feature of relay neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to striking differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, we align cellular expression profiles across species and find homologous types of relay neurons in macaque and human, and distinct relay neurons in mouse.</description>

	<description>Osteoarthritis associated pain (OA-pain) is a significant global problem. OA-pain limits limb use and mobility, and is associated with widespread sensitivity. Therapeutic options are limited, and the ones that are available are often associated with side or adverse effects. The lack of therapeutic options is partly due to a lack of understanding of clinically relevant underlying neural mechanisms of OA-pain. In previous work in naturally occurring OA-pain in dogs, we identified potential signaling molecules (artemin/GFR3) that were upregulated. Here, we use multiple approaches including knockout mice, immunological suppression in a mouse model of OA, and clinically relevant measures of sensitivity and limb use to explore the functional role of artemin/GFR3 signaling in OA-pain. We found the monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA model in mice is associated with decreased limb use and hypersensitivity. GFR3 expression is increased in sensory neurons. Exogenous artemin induces heat, cold and mechanical hypersensitivity, and anti-artemin monoclonal antibody administration reverses this hypersensitivity and restores limb use in mice with MIA-induced OA pain. Our results provide a molecular basis of arthritis pain linked with artemin/GFR3 signaling and indicate that further work is warranted to investigate the neuronal plasticity and the pathways that drive pain in OA.</description>

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes acute hepatitis C and can lead to life-threating complications if it becomes chronic. The HCV genome is a single plus strand of RNA. Its intracellular replication is a spatiotemporally coordinated process of RNA translation upon cell infection, RNA synthesis within a replication compartment, and virus particle production. While HCV is mainly transmitted via mature infectious virus particles, it has also been suggested that HCV-infected cells can secrete HCV RNA carrying exosomes that can infect cells in a receptor independent manner. In order to gain insight into these two routes of transmission, we developed a series of intracellular HCV replication models that include HCV RNA secretion and/or virus assembly and release. Fitting our models to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data, in which cells were infected with HCV, suggests that initially most secreted HCV RNA derives from intracellular cytosolic plus-strand RNA, but subsequently secreted HCV RNA derives equally from the cytoplasm and the replication compartments. Furthermore, our model fits to the data suggest that the rate of virus assembly and release is limited by host cell resources. Including the effects of direct acting antivirals in our models, we found that in spite of decreasing intracellular HCV RNA and extracellular virus concentration, low level HCV RNA secretion may continue as long as intracellular RNA is available. This may possibly explain the presence of detectable levels of plasma HCV RNA at the end of treatment even in patients that ultimately attain a sustained virologic response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rQYSbDpFc8I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Resources are rarely distributed uniformly within a population. Heterogeneity in the concentration of a drug, the quality of breeding sites, or wealth can all affect evolutionary dynamics. In this study, we represent a collection of properties affecting the fitness at a given location using a color. A green node is rich in resources while a red node is poorer. More colors can represent a broader spectrum of resource qualities. For a population evolving according to the birth-death Moran model, the first question we address is which structures, identified by graph connectivity and graph coloring, are evolutionarily equivalent. We prove that all properly two-colored, undirected, regular graphs are evolutionarily equivalent (where “properly colored” means that no two neighbors have the same color). We then compare the effects of background heterogeneity on properly two-colored graphs to those with alternative schemes in which the colors are permuted. Finally, we discuss dynamic coloring as a model for spatiotemporal resource fluctuations, and we illustrate that random dynamic colorings often diminish the effects of background heterogeneity relative to a proper two-coloring.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hN2z9vY2h4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Interactive digital notebooks provide an opportunity for researchers and educators to carry out data analysis and report the results in a single digital format. Further to just being digital, the format allows for rich content to be created in order to interact with the code and data contained in such a notebook to form an educational narrative. This primer introduces some of the fundamental aspects involved in using Jupyter notebooks in an educational setting for teaching in the bio/health informatics disciplines. We also provide 2 case studies that detail how we used Jupyter notebooks to teach non-coders programming skills on a blended Master’s degree module for a Health Informatics programme and a fully online distance learning unit on Programming for a postgraduate certificate (PG Cert) in Clinical Bioinformatics with a more technical audience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kU7-jU-ioWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In eukaryotes, polyadenylation (poly(A)) is an essential process during mRNA maturation. Identifying the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-determinants of poly(A) signal (PAS) on the DNA sequence is the key to understand the mechanism of translation regulation and mRNA metabolism. Although machine learning methods were widely used in computationally identifying PAS, the need for tremendous amounts of annotation data hinder applications of existing methods in species without experimental data on PAS. Therefore, cross-species PAS identification, which enables the possibility to predict PAS from untrained species, naturally becomes a promising direction. In our works, we propose a novel deep learning method named Poly(A)-DG for cross-species PAS identification. Poly(A)-DG consists of a Convolution Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (CNN-MLP) network and a domain generalization technique. It learns PAS patterns from the training species and identifies PAS in target species without re-training. To test our method, we use three species and build cross-species training sets with two of them and evaluate the performance of the remaining one. Moreover, we test our method against insufficient data and imbalanced data issues and demonstrate that Poly(A)-DG not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also maintains relatively high accuracy when it comes to a smaller or imbalanced training set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XwVqYO6XZ-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations seek to provide atomic-level insights into conformationally dynamic biological systems at experimentally relevant time resolutions, such as those afforded by single-molecule fluorescence measurements. However, limitations in the time scales of MD simulations and the time resolution of single-molecule measurements have challenged efforts to obtain overlapping temporal regimes required for close quantitative comparisons. Achieving such overlap has the potential to provide novel theories, hypotheses, and interpretations that can inform idealized experimental designs that maximize the detection of the desired reaction coordinate. Here, we report MD simulations at time scales overlapping with &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; single-molecule Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements of the amino acid binding protein LIV-BP&lt;sup&gt;SS&lt;/sup&gt; at sub-millisecond resolution. Computationally efficient all-atom structure-based simulations, calibrated against explicit solvent simulations, were employed for sampling multiple cycles of LIV-BP&lt;sup&gt;SS&lt;/sup&gt; clamshell-like conformational changes on the time scale of seconds, examining the relationship between these events and those observed by smFRET. The MD simulations agree with the smFRET measurements and provide valuable information on local dynamics of fluorophores at their sites of attachment on LIV-BP&lt;sup&gt;SS&lt;/sup&gt; and the correlations between fluorophore motions and large-scale conformational changes between LIV-BP&lt;sup&gt;SS&lt;/sup&gt; domains. We further utilize the MD simulations to inform the interpretation of smFRET data, including Förster radius (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and fluorophore orientation factor (κ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) determinations. The approach we describe can be readily extended to distinct biochemical systems, allowing for the interpretation of any FRET system conjugated to protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes, including those with more conformational processes, as well as those implementing multi-color smFRET.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTOMs9cRepw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Safety and Efficacy of Omaveloxolone in Friedreich Ataxia (MOXIe Study)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25934?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorder with no approved treatment. Omaveloxolone, an Nrf2 activator, improves mitochondrial function, restores redox balance, and reduces inflammation in models of FA. We investigated the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an international, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, registrational phase 2 trial at 11 institutions in the United States, Europe, and Australia (NCT02255435, EudraCT2015‐002762‐23). Eligible patients, 16 to 40 years of age with genetically confirmed FA and baseline modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores between 20 and 80, were randomized 1:1 to placebo or 150mg per day of omaveloxolone. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the mFARS score in those treated with omaveloxolone compared with those on placebo at 48 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred fifty‐five patients were screened, and 103 were randomly assigned to receive omaveloxolone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 52), with 40 omaveloxolone patients and 42 placebo patients analyzed in the full analysis set. Changes from baseline in mFARS scores in omaveloxolone (−1.55 ± 0.69) and placebo (0.85 ± 0.64) patients showed a difference between treatment groups of –2.40 ± 0.96 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.014). Transient reversible increases in aminotransferase levels were observed with omaveloxolone without increases in total bilirubin or other signs of liver injury. Headache, nausea, and fatigue were also more common among patients receiving omaveloxolone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the MOXIe trial, omaveloxolone significantly improved neurological function compared to placebo and was generally safe and well tolerated. It represents a potential therapeutic agent in FA. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy Caused by a Homozygous Splicing Variant of SLC7A6OS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated families with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Affected individuals from both families shared a rare, homozygous c.191A &amp;gt; G variant affecting a splice site in &lt;i&gt;SLC7A6OS&lt;/i&gt;. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated partial splice site abolition and the creation of an abnormal isoform. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed a marked reduction of protein expression. Haplotype analysis identified a ~0.85cM shared genomic region on chromosome 16q encompassing the c.191A &amp;gt; G variant, consistent with a distant ancestor common to both families. Our results suggest that biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in &lt;i&gt;SLC7A6OS&lt;/i&gt; are a novel genetic cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Structural and functional organization of the lower jaw barrel subfield in rat primary somatosensory cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f12053a-fd28-4f73-987a-a14b01abb662/cne25063-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we physiologically mapped the representation of lower jaw (chin vibrissae, chin microvibrissae, and lower lip) in rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and correlated the physiological map to the underlying morphological barrel field map in the lower jaw barrel subfield in SI. We report that the lower jaw barrel subfield is somatopically organized in a single map of the contralateral lower jaw skin surface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrel subfields in rodent primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are important model systems for studying cortical organization and reorganization. During cortical reorganization that follows limb deafferentation, neurons in deafferented forelimb SI become responsive to previously unexpressed inputs from the lower jaw. Although the lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) is a likely source of the input, this subfield has received little attention. Our aim was to describe the structural and functional organization of the normal LJBSF. To investigate LJBSF organization, a nomenclature for lower jaw skin surface was developed, cytochrome oxidase (CO) was used to label flattened‐cut LJBSF sections, microelectrodes were used to map the lower jaw skin surface representation in SI, and electrolytic lesions, recovered from electrode penetrations, were used to align the physiological map to the underlying barrel map. LJBSF is a tear‐shaped subfield containing approximately 24 barrels, arranged in eight mediolateral rows and a barrel‐free zone capping the anterior border. The representation of the lower jaw skin consisting of chin vibrissae and microvibrissae embedded in common fur is somatotopically organized in a single map in the contralateral SI. This physiological map shows that the activity from the vibrissae aligns with the CO‐staining of the underlying LJBSF. LJBSF barrels receive topographically ordered barrel‐specific input from individual vibrissa and microvibrissae in the lower jaw but not from trident whiskers. The barrel‐free zone receives topographically ordered input from the lower lip. These data demonstrating that the LJBSF is a highly organized subfield are essential for understanding its possible role in cortical reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is susceptible to continuous fibrillar beta amyloid plaque deposition in aged amyloid precursor protein/PS1 mice. In contrast, after 12 months of age, fibrillar plaque load plateaus in the primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (SS2). Midlife (6–12 months of age) environmental enrichment (EE) decreases the accumulation of fibrillar plaque in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC region.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentally enriched housing conditions can increase performance on cognitive tasks in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice; however, the potential effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on disease modification in terms of pathological change are inconclusive. We hypothesized that previous contrasting findings may be attributable to regional differences in susceptibility to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in cortical regions that are functionally associated with EE. We characterized fibrillar plaque deposition in 6, 12, and 18–22 months old APP/PS1 mice in the prefrontal (PFC), somatosensory (SS2), and primary motor cortex (M1). We found a significant increase in plaque load between 6 and 12 months in all regions. In animals over 12 months, only the PFC region continued to significantly accumulate plaques. Additionally, 12 months old animals subjected to 6 months of EE showed improved spatial navigation and had significantly fewer plaques in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC. These findings suggest that the PFC region is selectively susceptible to Aβ deposition and less responsive to the attenuating effects of EE. In contrast, M1 and SS2 regions plateau with respect to Aβ deposition by 12 months of age and are susceptible to amyloid pathology modification by midlife EE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predicting and comparing algorithm performance on graph instances is
challenging for multiple reasons. First, there is usually no standard set of
instances to benchmark performance. Second, using existing graph generators
results in a restricted spectrum of difficulty and the resulting graphs are
usually not diverse enough to draw sound conclusions. That is why recent work
proposes a new methodology to generate a diverse set of instances by using an
evolutionary algorithm. We can then analyze the resulting graphs and get key
insights into which attributes are most related to algorithm performance. We
can also fill observed gaps in the instance space in order to generate graphs
with previously unseen combinations of features. This methodology is applied to
the instance space of the Hamiltonian completion problem using two different
solvers, namely the Concorde TSP Solver and a multi-start local search
algorithm.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study is focused on applying genetic algorithms (GA) to model and band
selection in hyperspectral image classification. We use a forensic-inspired
data set of seven hyperspectral images with blood and five visually similar
substances to test GA-optimised classifiers in two scenarios: when the training
and test data come from the same image and when they come from different
images, which is a more challenging task due to significant spectra
differences. In our experiments we compare GA with a classic model optimisation
through grid search. Our results show that GA-based model optimisation can
reduce the number of bands and create an accurate classifier that outperforms
the GS-based reference models, provided that during model optimisation it has
access to examples similar to test data. We illustrate this with experiment
highlighting the importance of a validation set.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learned optimizers are algorithms that can themselves be trained to solve
optimization problems. In contrast to baseline optimizers (such as momentum or
Adam) that use simple update rules derived from theoretical principles, learned
optimizers use flexible, high-dimensional, nonlinear parameterizations.
Although this can lead to better performance in certain settings, their inner
workings remain a mystery. How is a learned optimizer able to outperform a well
tuned baseline? Has it learned a sophisticated combination of existing
optimization techniques, or is it implementing completely new behavior? In this
work, we address these questions by careful analysis and visualization of
learned optimizers. We study learned optimizers trained from scratch on three
disparate tasks, and discover that they have learned interpretable mechanisms,
including: momentum, gradient clipping, learning rate schedules, and a new form
of learning rate adaptation. Moreover, we show how the dynamics of learned
optimizers enables these behaviors. Our results help elucidate the previously
murky understanding of how learned optimizers work, and establish tools for
interpreting future learned optimizers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Local ancestry inference (LAI) identifies the ancestry of each segment of an
individual's genome and is an important step in medical and population genetic
studies of diverse cohorts. Several techniques have been used for LAI,
including Hidden Markov Models and Random Forests. Here, we formulate the LAI
task as an image segmentation problem and develop a new LAI tool using a deep
convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture. We train our
model using complete genome sequences from 982 unadmixed individuals from each
of five continental ancestry groups, and we evaluate it using simulated admixed
data derived from an additional 279 individuals selected from the same
populations. We show that our model is able to learn admixture as a zero-shot
task, yielding ancestry assignments that are nearly as accurate as those from
the existing gold standard tool, RFMix.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Rectified Linear Postsynaptic Potential Function for Backpropagation in Deep Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2003.11837v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use spatio-temporal spike patterns to
represent and transmit information, which is not only biologically realistic
but also suitable for ultra-low-power event-driven neuromorphic implementation.
Motivated by the success of deep learning, the study of Deep Spiking Neural
Networks (DeepSNNs) provides promising directions for artificial intelligence
applications. However, training of DeepSNNs is not straightforward because the
well-studied error back-propagation (BP) algorithm is not directly applicable.
In this paper, we first establish an understanding as to why error
back-propagation does not work well in DeepSNNs. To address this problem, we
propose a simple yet efficient Rectified Linear Postsynaptic Potential function
(ReL-PSP) for spiking neurons and propose a Spike-Timing-Dependent
Back-Propagation (STDBP) learning algorithm for DeepSNNs. In STDBP algorithm,
the timing of individual spikes is used to convey information (temporal
coding), and learning (back-propagation) is performed based on spike timing in
an event-driven manner. Our experimental results show that the proposed
learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in single
spike time based learning algorithms of DeepSNNs. Furthermore, by utilizing the
trained model parameters obtained from the proposed STDBP learning algorithm,
we demonstrate the ultra-low-power inference operations on a recently proposed
neuromorphic inference accelerator. Experimental results show that the
neuromorphic hardware consumes 0.751~mW of the total power consumption and
achieves a low latency of 47.71~ms to classify an image from the MNIST dataset.
Overall, this work investigates the contribution of spike timing dynamics to
information encoding, synaptic plasticity and decision making, providing a new
perspective to design of future DeepSNNs and neuromorphic hardware systems.

Here the authors find that CTCF positions cohesin through its N-terminus but does not control its overall binding dynamics on chromatin, and show how the orientation of CTCF binding sites translates into genome folding patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/00OM3mm0hOI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Deep rTMS Mitigates Behavioral and Neuropathologic Anomalies in Cuprizone-Exposed Mice Through Reducing Microglial Proinflammatory Cytokines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.556839</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In comparison to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta burst stimulation is stronger and more effective as a brain stimulation approach within short periods. Although this deep rTMS technique is being applied in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, few animal studies have attempted to clarify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects. This animal study examined the effects of deep rTMS on the cuprizone-induced neuropathologic and behavioral anomalies and explored the underlying mechanism. Adolescent male C57BL/6 mice were fed a rodent chow without or with cuprizone (CPZ; 0.2% w/w) for 5 weeks. Another two groups of mice were subjected to deep rTMS or sham rTMS once a day during weeks 2–5 of the CPZ-feeding period. The behaviors of all mice were assessed after the withdrawal of CPZ before neuropathological and immunological analyses. Compared to the CNT group, mice in CPZ and CPZ + Sham groups showed deficits in social recognition and spatial working memory as well as anxiety-like behavior, in addition to myelin breakdown and OL loss in the corpus callosum (CC), caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of the brain. Deep rTMS effectively reduced behavioral anomalies and blocked myelin breakdown and OL loss in CPZ-fed mice. Besides, it also dampened microglia activation at lesion sites and rectified cytokines levels (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in CPZ-affected regions. The most significant effect was seen in the cerebral cortex where alleviated neuropathology co-existed with less microglia activation and higher IL-10 level. These data provided experimental evidence for the beneficial effects of deep rTMS in CPZ-fed mice and revealed a neurobiological mechanism of the modality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Activated Erk Is an Early Retrograde Signal After Spinal Cord Injury in the Lamprey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580692</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580692</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that spinal cord transection (TX) in the lamprey causes mRNA to accumulate in the injured tips of large reticulospinal (RS) axons. We sought to determine whether this mRNA accumulation results from phosphorylation and transport of retrograde signals, similar to what has been reported in mammalian peripheral nerve. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk), mediates the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of many neurotrophic factors. To assess the role of Erk in retrograde signaling of RS axon injury, we used immunoblot and immunohistochemistry to determine the changes in phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) in the spinal cord after spinal cord TX. Immunostaining for p-Erk increased within axons and local cell bodies, most heavily within the 1-2 mm closest to the TX site, at between 3 and 6 h post-TX. In axons, p-Erk was concentrated in 3-5 μm granules that became less numerous with distance from the TX. The retrograde molecular motor dynein colocalized with p-Erk, but vimentin, which in peripheral nerve was reported to participate with p-Erk as part of a retrograde signal complex, did not colocalize with p-Erk, even though vimentin levels were elevated post-TX. The results suggest that p-Erk, but not vimentin, may function as a retrograde axotomy signal in lamprey central nervous system neurons, and that this signal may induce transcription of mRNA, which is then transported down the axon to its injured tip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease. Numerous studies have demonstrated a critical role for dysregulated glucose metabolism in its pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize metabolic alterations in aging brain and AD-related metabolic deficits associated with glucose metabolism dysregulation, glycolysis dysfunction, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficits, and pentose phosphate pathway impairment. Additionally, we discuss recent treatment strategies targeting metabolic defects in AD, including their limitations, in an effort to encourage the development of novel therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Posterior Parietal Cortex Is Involved in Gait Adaptation: A Bilateral Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gait is one of the fundamental behaviors we use to interact with the world. The functionality of the locomotor system is thus related to enriching interactions with our environment. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been found to contribute to motor adaptation during both visuomotor and postural adaptation tasks. Additionally, structural or functional deficits of the PPC lead to impairments in gaits such as shortened steps and increased step width. Based on the aforementioned roles of the PPC, and the importance of gait adaptability, the current investigation sought to identify the role of the PPC in gait adaptation. To achieve this, we performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the bilateral PPC before performing a split-belt treadmill gait adaptation paradigm. We used three stimulation conditions in a within-subject design. tDCS was administered in a randomized and double-blinded order. Following each stimulation session, subjects first performed baseline walking with both belts running at the same speed. Then, subjects walked for 15 min on an uncoupled treadmill, with the belts being driven at a 3:1 speed ratio. Last, they returned to normal (i.e., tied-belt) walking for 5 min. Results from 15 young and healthy subjects identified that subjects required more steps to adapt to split-belt walking following the suppression of the left hemisphere PPC, contralateral to the fast belt. Furthermore, while suppression of the left hemisphere PPC did not increase the number of steps required to re-adapt to tied-belt walking, this condition did lead to increased magnitude of after-effects. Together, these findings indicate that the PPC is involved in locomotor adaptation. These results support previous literature regarding the upper body or postural adaptation and extend these findings to the realm of gait. Results highlight the PPC as a potential target for neurorehabilitation designed to improve gait adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using Fixation-Related Potentials for Inspecting Natural Interactions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer unique windows into the cognitive processes underlying human-machine interaction. Identifying and analyzing the appropriate brain activity to have access to such windows is often difficult due to technical or psycho-physiological constraints. Indeed, studying interactions through this approach frequently requires adapting them to accommodate specific BCI-related paradigms which change the functioning of their interface on both the human-side and the machine-side. The combined examination of Electroencephalography and Eyetracking recordings, mainly by means of studying Fixation-Related Potentials, can help to circumvent the necessity for these adaptations by determining interaction-relevant moments during natural manipulation. In this contribution, we examine how properties contained within the bi-modal recordings can be used to assess valuable information about the interaction. Practically, three properties are studied which can be obtained solely through data obtained from analysis of the recorded biosignals. Namely, these properties consist of relative gaze metrics, being abstractions of the gaze patterns, the amplitude variations in the early brain activity potentials and the brain activity frequency band differences between fixations. Through their observation, information about three different aspects of the explored interface are obtained. Respectively, the properties provide insights about general perceived task difficulty, locate moments of higher attentional effort and discriminate between moments of exploration and moments of active interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Vibration Alert to the Brain: Evoked and Induced MEG Responses to High-Frequency Vibrotactile Stimuli on the Index Finger of Dominant and Non-dominant Hand</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576082</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576082</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: In recent years, vibrotactile haptic feedback technology has been widely used for user interfaces in the mobile devices. Although functional neuroimaging studies have investigated human brain responses to different types of tactile inputs, the neural mechanisms underlying high-frequency vibrotactile perception are still relatively unknown. Our aim was to investigate neuromagnetic brain responses to high-frequency vibrotactile stimulation, using magnetoencephalography (MEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We measured 152-channel whole-head MEG in 30 healthy, right-handed volunteers (aged 20–28 years, 15 females). A total of 300 vibrotactile stimuli were presented at the tip of either the left index finger or the right index finger in two separate sessions. Sinusoidal vibrations at 150 Hz for 200 ms were generated with random inter-stimulus intervals between 1.6 and 2.4 s. Both time-locked analysis and time-frequency analysis were performed to identify peak responses and oscillatory modulations elicited by high-frequency vibrations. The significance of the evoked and induced responses for dominant and non-dominant hand stimulation conditions was statistically tested, respectively. The difference in responses between stimulation conditions was also statistically evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Prominent peak responses were observed at 56 ms (M50) and at 100 ms (M100) for both stimulation conditions. The M50 response revealed clear dipolar field patterns in the contralateral side with significant cortical activations in the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, whereas the M100 response was not as prominent as the M50. Vibrotactile stimulation induced significant suppression of both alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (20–30 Hz) band activity during the mid-latency period (0.2–0.4 s), primarily in sensorimotor areas contralateral to the stimulation side. In addition, a significant alpha enhancement effect in posterior regions was accompanied with alpha suppressions in sensorimotor regions. The alpha suppression was observed in a broader distribution of cortical areas for the non-dominant hand stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that high-frequency tactile vibrations, which is known to primarily activate Pacinian corpuscles, elicit somatosensory M50 and M100 responses in the evoked fields and induce modulations of alpha and beta band oscillations during mid-latency periods. Our study is also consistent with that the primary sensorimotor area is significantly involved in the processing of high-frequency vibrotactile information with contralateral dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Pilot Study on Data-Driven Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation in Chronically Implanted Essential Tremor Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.541625</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential-tremor (ET). In adaptive DBS (aDBS) systems, online tuning of stimulation parameters as a function of neural signals may improve treatment efficacy and reduce side-effects. State-of-the-art aDBS systems use symptom surrogates derived from neural signals—so-called neural markers (NMs)—defined on the patient-group level, and control strategies assuming stationarity of symptoms and NMs. We aim at improving these aDBS systems with (1) a data-driven approach for identifying patient- and session-specific NMs and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. The two building blocks are implemented as follows: (1) The data-driven NMs are based on a machine learning model estimating tremor intensity from electrocorticographic signals. (2) The control strategy accounts for local variability of tremor statistics. Our study with three chronically implanted ET patients amounted to five online sessions. Tremor quantified from accelerometer data shows that symptom suppression is at least equivalent to that of a continuous DBS strategy in 3 out-of 4 online tests, while considerably reducing net stimulation (at least 24%). In the remaining online test, symptom suppression was not significantly different from either the continuous strategy or the no treatment condition. We introduce a novel aDBS system for ET. It is the first aDBS system based on (1) a machine learning model to identify session-specific NMs, and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. We show the suitability of our aDBS approach for ET, which opens the door to its further study in a larger patient population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: To examine cerebral cortical activation differences in the frontal cortex and parietal lobe during the performance of two types of dumbbell exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 22 young healthy male adults (mean age, 23.8 ± 2.05 years; height, 1.75 ± 0.06 m; weight, 71.4 ± 8.80 kg) participated in a crossover design study that involved two experimental exercise conditions: momentum dumbbell and conventional dumbbell. Performance tasks included 10, 10-s sets of single-arm dumbbell exercise, with a rest interval of 60 s between sets and a 5-min washout period between conditions. The primary outcome was the cerebral concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the frontal cortex and parietal lobe assessed during performance of both exercises using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The secondary outcome was upper-limb muscle activation measured using surface electromyography (sEMG). Outcome data were ascertained during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A significant between-condition difference in HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was observed in the frontal and parietal regions with an increase in HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during momentum, relative to conventional, dumbbell exercise (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Compared to conventional dumbbell exercise, performing a momentum dumbbell exercise led to a higher level of muscle activation in the anterior and posterior deltoids of the upper arm and in the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis longus of the forearm (p &amp;lt; 0.05). However, no between-condition differences were found in the biceps and triceps brachii (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Dynamic, compared with conventional, dumbbell exercise resulted in higher hemodynamic responses and greater upper-limb muscle activation in young healthy adults. The findings of this study showed differential cortical hemodynamic responses during performance of the two types of dumbbell exercise with a higher activation level produced during momentum-based dumbbell exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many current computational models that aim to simulate cortical and hippocampal modules of the brain depend on artificial neural networks. However, such classical or even deep neural networks are very slow, sometimes taking thousands of trials to obtain the final response with a considerable amount of error. The need for a large number of trials at learning and the inaccurate output responses are due to the complexity of the input cue and the biological processes being simulated. This article proposes a computational model for an intact and a lesioned cortico-hippocampal system using quantum-inspired neural networks. This cortico-hippocampal computational quantum-inspired (CHCQI) model simulates cortical and hippocampal modules by using adaptively updated neural networks entangled with quantum circuits. The proposed model is used to simulate various classical conditioning tasks related to biological processes. The output of the simulated tasks yielded the desired responses quickly and efficiently compared with other computational models, including the recently published Green model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability of humans and animals to localize the source of a sound in a complex acoustic environment facilitates communication and survival. Two cues are used for sound localization at horizontal planes, interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD), which are analyzed by distinct neural circuits in the brainstem. Here, we review the studies on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated neuromodulation of both intrinsic and synaptic properties of brainstem neurons in these circuits. Both mammalian and avian animal models have been used, with each having their advantages that are not present in the other. For the mammalian model, we discuss mGluR neuromodulation in the ILD circuit, with an emphasis on the recent discovery of differential modulation of synaptic transmission of different transmitter release modes. For the avian model, we focus on reviewing mGluR neuromodulation in the ITD pathway, with an emphasis on tonotopic distribution and synaptic plasticity of mGluR modulation in coincidence detector neurons. Future works are proposed to further investigate the functions and mechanisms of mGluRs in the sound localization circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activation of the ARCPOMC→MeA Projection Reduces Food Intake</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.595783</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) plays an essential role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) are expressed in key areas that are implicated in regulating energy homeostasis. Although the importance of MC4Rs in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) has been well documented, the role of MC4Rs in the medial amygdala (MeA) on feeding remains controversial. In this study, we specifically examine the role of a novel ARC&lt;sup&gt;POMC&lt;/sup&gt;→MeA neural circuit in the regulation of short-term food intake. To map a local melanocortinergic neural circuit, we use monosynaptic anterograde as well as retrograde viral tracers and perform double immunohistochemistry to determine the identity of the neurons receiving synaptic input from POMC neurons in the ARC. To investigate the role of the ARC&lt;sup&gt;POMC&lt;/sup&gt;→MeA projection on feeding, we optogenetically stimulate channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing POMC fibers in the MeA. Anterograde viral tracing studies reveal that ARC POMC neurons send axonal projections to estrogen receptor-α (ER-α)- and MC4R-expressing neurons in the MeA. Retrograde viral tracing experiments show that the neurons projecting to the MeA is located mainly in the lateral part of the ARC. Optogenetic stimulation of the ARC&lt;sup&gt;POMC&lt;/sup&gt;→MeA pathway reduces short-term food intake. This anorectic effect is blocked by treatment with the MC4R antagonist SHU9119. In addition to the melanocortinergic local circuits within the hypothalamus, this extrahypothalamic ARC&lt;sup&gt;POMC&lt;/sup&gt;→MeA neural circuit would play a role in regulating short-term food intake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Serotonergic Modulation of Locomotor Activity From Basal Vertebrates to Mammals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.590299</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.590299</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;During the last 50 years, the serotonergic (5-HT) system was reported to exert a complex modulation of locomotor activity. Here, we focus on two key factors that likely contribute to such complexity. First, locomotion is modulated directly and indirectly by 5-HT neurons. The locomotor circuitry is directly innervated by 5-HT neurons in the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. Also, indirect control of locomotor activity results from ascending projections of 5-HT cells in the rostral brainstem that innervate multiple brain centers involved in motor action planning. Second, each approach used to manipulate the 5-HT system likely engages different 5-HT-dependent mechanisms. This includes the recruitment of different 5-HT receptors, which can have excitatory or inhibitory effects on cell activity. These receptors can be located far or close to the 5-HT release sites, making their activation dependent on the level of 5-HT released. Here we review the activity of different 5-HT nuclei during locomotor activity, and the locomotor effects of 5-HT precursors, exogenous 5-HT, selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), electrical or chemical stimulation of 5-HT neurons, genetic deletions, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. We highlight both the coherent and controversial aspects of 5-HT modulation of locomotor activity from basal vertebrates to mammals. This mini review may hopefully inspire future studies aiming at dissecting the complex effects of 5-HT on locomotor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A17 Amacrine Cells and Olfactory Granule Cells: Parallel Processors of Early Sensory Information</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600537</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons typically receive synaptic input in their dendritic arbor, integrate inputs in their soma, and send output action potentials through their axon, following Cajal’s law of dynamic polarization. Two notable exceptions are retinal amacrine cells and olfactory granule cells (GCs), which flout Cajal’s edict by providing synaptic output from the same dendrites that collect synaptic input. Amacrine cells, a diverse cell class comprising &amp;gt;60 subtypes, employ various dendritic input/output strategies, but A17 amacrine cells (A17s) in particular share further interesting functional characteristics with GCs: both receive excitatory synaptic input from neurons in the primary glutamatergic pathway and return immediate, reciprocal feedback via GABAergic inhibitory synapses to the same synaptic terminals that provided input. Both neurons thereby process signals locally within their dendrites, shaping many parallels, signaling pathways independently. The similarities between A17s and GCs cast into relief striking differences that may indicate distinct processing roles within their respective circuits: First, they employ partially dissimilar molecular mechanisms to transform excitatory input into inhibitory output; second, GCs fire action potentials, whereas A17s do not. Third, GC signals may be influenced by cortical feedback, whereas the mammalian retina receives no such retrograde input. Finally, A17s constitute just one subtype within a diverse class that is specialized in a particular task, whereas the more homogeneous GCs may play more diverse signaling roles via multiple processing modes. Here, we review these analogies and distinctions between A17 amacrine cells and granule cells, hoping to gain further insight into the operating principles of these two sensory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are the tools used to perceive and navigate the world. They enable us to obtain essential resources such as food and highly desired resources such as mates. Thanks to the investments in biomedical research the molecular unpinning’s of human sensation are rivaled only by our knowledge of sensation in the laboratory mouse. Humans rely heavily on vision whereas mice use smell as their dominant sense. Both modalities have many features in common, starting with signal detection by highly specialized primary sensory neurons—rod and cone photoreceptors (PR) for vision, and olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for the smell. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how these two types of primary sensory neurons operate while highlighting the similarities and distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Development of Neuroregenerative Gene Therapy to Reverse Glial Scar Tissue Back to Neuron-Enriched Tissue</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Injuries in the central nervous system (CNS) often causes neuronal loss and glial scar formation. We have recently demonstrated NeuroD1-mediated direct conversion of reactive glial cells into functional neurons in adult mouse brains. Here, we further investigate whether such direct glia-to-neuron conversion technology can reverse glial scar back to neural tissue in a severe stab injury model of the mouse cortex. Using an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy approach, we ectopically expressed a single neural transcription factor NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes in the injured areas. We discovered that the reactive astrocytes were efficiently converted into neurons both before and after glial scar formation, and the remaining astrocytes proliferated to repopulate themselves. The astrocyte-converted neurons were highly functional, capable of firing action potentials and establishing synaptic connections with other neurons. Unexpectedly, the expression of NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes resulted in a significant reduction of toxic A1 astrocytes, together with a significant decrease of reactive microglia and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, accompanying the regeneration of new neurons and repopulation of new astrocytes, new blood vessels emerged and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) was restored. These results demonstrate an innovative neuroregenerative gene therapy that can directly reverse glial scar back to neural tissue, opening a new avenue for brain repair after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Minimal Number of Required Inputs for Temporally Precise Action Potential Generation in Auditory Brainstem Nuclei</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The auditory system relies on temporal precise information transfer, requiring an interplay of synchronously activated inputs and rapid postsynaptic integration. During late postnatal development synaptic, biophysical, and morphological features change to enable mature auditory neurons to perform their appropriate function. How the number of minimal required input fibers and the relevant EPSC time course integrated for action potential generation changes during late postnatal development is unclear. To answer these questions, we used in vitro electrophysiology in auditory brainstem structures from pre-hearing onset and mature Mongolian gerbils of either sex. Synaptic and biophysical parameters changed distinctively during development in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), the medial superior olive (MSO), and the ventral and dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL and DNLL). Despite a reduction in input resistance in most cell types, all required fewer inputs in the mature stage to drive action potentials. Moreover, the EPSC decay time constant is a good predictor of the EPSC time used for action potential generation in all nuclei but the VNLL. Only in MSO neurons, the full EPSC time course is integrated by the neuron’s resistive element, while otherwise, the relevant EPSC time matches only 5–10% of the membrane time constant, indicating membrane charging as a dominant role for output generation. We conclude, that distinct developmental programs lead to a general increase in temporal precision and integration accuracy matched to the information relaying properties of the investigated nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Harnessing the Neural Stem Cell Secretome for Regenerative Neuroimmunology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence foresees the secretome of neural stem cells (NSCs) to confer superimposable beneficial properties as exogenous NSC transplants in experimental treatments of traumas and diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Naturally produced secretome biologics include membrane-free signaling molecules and extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) capable of regulating broad functional responses. The development of high-throughput screening pipelines for the identification and validation of NSC secretome targets is still in early development. Encouraging results from pre-clinical animal models of disease have highlighted secretome-based (acellular) therapeutics as providing significant improvements in biochemical and behavioral measurements. Most of these responses are being hypothesized to be the result of modulating and promoting the restoration of key inflammatory and regenerative programs in the CNS. Here, we will review the most recent findings regarding the identification of NSC-secreted factors capable of modulating the immune response to promote the regeneration of the CNS in animal models of CNS trauma and inflammatory disease and discuss the increased interest to refine the pro-regenerative features of the NSC secretome into a clinically available therapy in the emerging field of Regenerative Neuroimmunology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: DAPK1 Promotes Extrasynaptic GluN2B Phosphorylation and Striatal Spine Instability in the YAC128 Mouse Model of Huntington Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.590569</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.590569</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Disrupted cortico-striatal transmission is an early event that contributes to neuronal spine and synapse dysfunction primarily in striatal medium spiny neurons, the most vulnerable cell type in the disease, but also in neurons of other brain regions including the cortex. Although striatal and cortical neurons eventually degenerate, these synaptic and circuit changes may underlie some of the earliest motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, synaptic dysfunction and spine loss are hypothesized to be therapeutically reversible before neuronal death occurs, and restoration of normal synaptic function may delay neurodegeneration. One of the earliest synaptic alterations to occur in HD mouse models is enhanced striatal extrasynaptic NMDA receptor expression and activity. This activity is mediated primarily through GluN2B subunit-containing receptors and is associated with increased activation of cell death pathways, inhibition of survival signaling, and greater susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a pro-apoptotic kinase highly expressed in neurons during development. In the adult brain, DAPK1 becomes re-activated and recruited to extrasynaptic NMDAR complexes during neuronal death, where it phosphorylates GluN2B at S1303, amplifying toxic receptor function. Approaches to reduce DAPK1 activity have demonstrated benefit in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic stress, indicating that DAPK1 may be a novel target for neuroprotection. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of DAPK1 occurs early in the YAC128 HD mouse model, and contributes to elevated extrasynaptic GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation. Inhibition of DAPK1 normalizes extrasynaptic GluN2B phosphorylation and surface expression, and completely prevents YAC128 striatal spine loss in cortico-striatal co-culture, thus validating DAPK1 as a potential target for synaptic protection in HD and warranting further development of DAPK1-targeted therapies for neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Substrate Elasticity Exerts Functional Effects on Primary Microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.590500</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia—the brain’s primary immune cells—exert a tightly regulated cascade of pro- and anti-inflammatory effects upon brain pathology, either promoting regeneration or neurodegeneration. Therefore, harnessing microglia emerges as a potential therapeutic concept in neurological research. Recent studies suggest that—besides being affected by chemokines and cytokines—various cell entities in the brain relevantly respond to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. For example, we lately reported considerable effects of elasticity on neural stem cells, regarding quiescence and differentiation potential. However, the effects of elasticity on microglia remain to be explored.Under the hypothesis that the elasticity of the microenvironment affects key characteristics and functions of microglia, we established an in vitro model of primary rat microglia grown in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer-based cell culture system. This way, we simulated the brain’s physiological elasticity range and compared it to supraphysiological stiffer PDMS controls. We assessed functional parameters of microglia under “resting” conditions, as well as when polarized towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) by interleukin-4 (IL-4). Microglia viability was unimpaired on soft substrates, but we found various significant effects with a more than two-fold increase in microglia proliferation on soft substrate elasticities mimicking the brain (relative to PDMS controls). Furthermore, soft substrates promoted the expression of the activation marker vimentin in microglia. Moreover, the M2-marker CD206 was upregulated in parallel to an increase in the secretion of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1). The upregulation of CD206 was abolished by blockage of stretch-dependent chloride channels. Our data suggest that the cultivation of microglia on substrates of brain-like elasticity promotes a basic anti-inflammatory activation state via stretch-dependent chloride channels. The results highlight the significance of the omnipresent but mostly overlooked mechanobiological effects exerted on microglia and contribute to a better understanding of the complex spatial and temporal interactions between microglia, neural stem cells, and glia, in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: White Matter Plasticity in Anxiety: Disruption of Neural Network Synchronization During Threat-Safety Discrimination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence highlighted the importance of white matter tracts in typical and atypical behaviors. White matter dynamically changes in response to learning, stress, and social experiences. Several lines of evidence have reported white matter dysfunction in psychiatric conditions, including depression, stress- and anxiety-related disorders. The mechanistic underpinnings of these associations, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we outline an integrative perspective positing a link between aberrant myelin plasticity and anxiety. Drawing on extant literature and emerging new findings, we suggest that in anxiety, unique changes may occur in response to threat and to safety learning and the ability to discriminate between both types of stimuli. We propose that altered myelin plasticity in the neural circuits underlying these two forms of learning relates to the emergence of anxiety-related disorders, by compromising mechanisms of neural network synchronization. The clinical and translational implications of this model for anxiety-related disorders are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Acute Effects of Ethanol on Hippocampal Spatial Representation and Offline Reactivation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acute alcohol exposure impairs hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. However, there is little evidence for the effects of ethanol on the spike patterns of hippocampal cell populations. Here, we examined how the spatial firing patterns of place cells, neurons that encode specific locations, were altered in rats that were intraperitoneally injected with 1.5 g/kg ethanol. Ethanol administration partly reduced or abolished place-selective spiking of a subset of place cells during running periods in a spatial task, whereas a subset of place fields newly emerged, suggesting a partial reorganization of hippocampal spatial maps by ethanol. On the other hand, ethanol administration did not significantly alter the frequency of hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWRs) and synchronous spike patterns during resting periods, suggesting that offline memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms underpinned by hippocampal neuronal synchronization are not strongly affected by ethanol. These results indicate that acute ethanol intake mainly affects the encoding of external information but has little impact on internal memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Contributions of Hippocampal Volume to Cognition in Healthy Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The association between hippocampal volume and memory is continuing to be characterized in healthy older adults. Prior research suggests smaller hippocampal volume in healthy older adults is associated with poorer episodic memory and processing speed, as well as working memory, verbal learning, and executive functioning as measured by the NIH Toolbox Fluid (Fluid Cognition Composite, FCC) and Crystalized Cognition Composites (CCC). This study aimed to replicate these findings and to evaluate the association between: (1) hippocampal asymmetry index and cognition; and (2) independent contributions of the left and right hippocampal volume and cognition in a large sample of healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants and Methods: One-hundred and eighty-three healthy older adults (M age = 71.72, SD = 5.3) received a T1-weighted sequence on a 3T scanner. Hippocampal subfields were extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0 and combined to provide left, right, and total hippocampal volumes. FCC subtests include Dimensional Change Card Sort, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, List Sorting, Picture Sequence Memory, and Pattern Comparison. CCC subtests include Picture Vocabulary and Oral Reading Recognition. Multiple linear regressions were performed predicting cognition composites from the total, left and right, and asymmetry of hippocampal volume, controlling for sex, education, scanner, and total intracranial volume. Multiple comparisons in primary analyses were corrected using a false discovery rate (FDR) of p &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: FCC scores were positively associated with total (β = 0.226, FDR q = 0.044) and left (β = 0.257, FDR q = 0.024) hippocampal volume. Within FCC, Picture Sequence Memory scores positively associated with total (β = 0.284, p = 0.001) and left (β = 0.98, p = 0.001) hippocampal volume. List Sorting scores were also positively associated with left hippocampal volume (β = 0.189, p = 0.029).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results confirm previous research suggesting that bilateral hippocampal volume is associated with FCC, namely episodic memory. The present study also suggests the left hippocampal volume may be more broadly associated with both episodic and working memory. Studies should continue to investigate lateralized hippocampal contributions to aging processes to better identify predictors of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neuroprotectin D1 Protects Against Postoperative Delirium-Like Behavior in Aged Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postoperative delirium (POD) is the most common postoperative complication affecting elderly patients, yet the underlying mechanism is elusive, and effective therapies are lacking. The neuroinflammation hypothesis for the pathogenesis of POD has recently emerged. Accumulating evidence is supporting the role of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in regulating inflammation. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), a novel docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived lipid mediator, has shown potent immunoresolvent and neuroprotective effects in several disease models associated with inflammation. Here, using a mouse model of POD, we investigated the role of NPD1 in postoperative cognitive impairment by assessing systemic inflammatory changes, the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and behavior in aged mice at different time points. We report that a single dose of NPD1 prophylaxis decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6 and upregulated the expression of IL-10 in peripheral blood, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, NPD1 limited the leakage of the BBB by increasing the expression of tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins such as ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin. NPD1 also abolished the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which is associated with improved general and memory function after surgery. In addition, NPD1 treatment modulated the inflammatory cytokine expression profile and improved the expression of the M2 marker CD206 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, which may partly explain the beneficial effects of NPD1 on inflammation. Collectively, these findings shed light on the proresolving activities of NPD1 in the pro-inflammatory milieu both in vivo and in vitro and may bring a novel therapeutic approach for POD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Different Perivascular Space Burdens in Idiopathic Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580853</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Excessive aggregation of α-synuclein is the key pathophysiological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is also associated with synucleinopathies and considered as a powerful predictor of PD. Growing evidence suggests the diminished clearance of α-synuclein may be partly attributable to poor interstitial fluid drainage, which can be reflected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible enlarged perivascular space (EPVS). However, the effect of MRI-visible EPVS on iRBD and PD, and their correlation with clinical characteristics remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the clinical and neuroimaging significance of MRI-visible EPVS in iRBD and PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 33 iRBD patients, 82 PD (with and without RBD) patients, and 35 healthy controls (HCs), who underwent clinical evaluation and 3.0 Tesla MRI. Two neurologists assessed MRI-visible EPVS in centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia (BG), substantia nigra (SN), and brainstem (BS). Independent risk factors for iRBD and PD were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Spearman analysis was used to test the correlation of MRI-visible EPVS with clinical characteristics of patients.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;iRBD patients had significantly higher EPVS burdens (CSO, BG, SN, and BS) than PD patients. Higher CSO-EPVS and BS-EPVS burdens were independent risk factors for iRBD. Furthermore, higher CSO-EPVS and SN-EPVS burdens were positively correlated with the severity of clinical symptom in iRBD patients, and higher BG-EPVS burden was positively correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;iRBD and PD patients have different MRI-visible EPVS burdens, which may be related with a compensatory mechanism in glymphatic system. Lower MRI-visible EPVS burden in PD patients may be a manifestation of severe brain waste drainage dysfunction. These findings shed light on the pathophysiologic relationship between iRBD and PD with respect to neuroimaging marker of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Impact of Age on the Association Between Physical Activity and White Matter Integrity in Cognitively Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.579470</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognition emerges from coordinated processing among distributed cortical brain regions, enabled through interconnected white matter networks. Cortical disconnection caused by age-related decline in white matter integrity (WMI) is likely to contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Physical activity (PA) has been suggested to have beneficial effects on white matter structure. However, its potential to counteract age-related decline in WMI is not yet well established. The present explorative study analyzed if PA was associated with WMI in cognitively healthy older adults and if this association was modulated by age. Forty-four cognitively healthy older individuals (aged 60–88 years) with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and PA measurements were included from the AgeGain study. Voxelwise analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) demonstrated that PA was associated with WMI in older adults. However, results emphasized that this association was restricted to high age. The association between PA and WMI was found in widespread white matter regions suggesting a global rather than a regional effect. Supplementary analyses demonstrated an association between the integrity of these regions and the performance in memory [verbal learning and memory test (VLMT)] and executive functioning (Tower of London).Results of the present explorative study support the assumption that PA is associated with WMI in older adults. However, results emphasize that this association is restricted to high age. Since cognitive decline in the elderly is typically most pronounced in later stages of aging, PA qualifies as a promising tool to foster resilience against age-related cognitive decline, via the preservation of the integrity of the brains WM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Metabolic Profiling of Cognitive Aging in Midlife</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) begins many years before its clinical symptoms. Metabolic dysfunction represents a core feature of AD and cognitive impairment, but few metabolomic studies have focused on cognitive aging in midlife. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we identified metabolic predictors of cognitive aging in midlife using fasting plasma sample from 30 middle-aged (mean age 57.2), male-male twin pairs enrolled in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). For all twin pairs, one twin developed incident MCI, whereas his co-twin brother remained to be cognitively normal during an average 5.5-year follow-up. Linear mixed model was used to identify metabolites predictive of MCI conversion or cognitive change over time, adjusting for traditional risk factors. Results from twins were replicated in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults (mean age 59.1) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP). Results in twins showed that higher baseline levels of four plasma metabolites, including sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0), sphingomyelin (d18:1/22:1, d18:2/22:0, and d16:1/24:1), DAG (18:2/20:4), and hydroxy-CMPF, were significantly associated with a slower decrease in one or more domains of cognitive function. The association of sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0) was replicated in WRAP. Our results support that metabolic perturbation occurs many years before cognitive impairment and plasma metabolites may serve as early biomarkers for prediction or monitoring of cognitive aging and AD in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Soluble 4R0N Tau Abrogates Endocytic Vesicular Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.537712</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aggregated tau is a hallmark neuropathological feature in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies aiming to validate aggregated tau pathology as a pathogenic driver of neurodegeneration in correlation to characteristic behavioral phenotypes have had shortcomings. Although studies on soluble tau pathology have effectively addressed these shortcomings, the role of soluble tau in the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is not yet unequivocally established. In sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the relevance of soluble tau pathology in endolysosomal dysfunction and autophagic stress, some of the earliest disease manifestations, is unclear. In this study, we report that soluble 4R0N tau overexpression affects the expression levels of certain markers associated with the endolysosomal system and autophagy. Moreover, through live-cell imaging, we found that the vesicular dynamics of early endosomes were affected with respect to spatiotemporal parameters and vesicle maturation. Additionally, we observed the localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) along the endocytic pathway and found that upon overexpression of soluble 4R0N tau, APP was preferentially localized to the endocytic compartments implicated in the amyloidogenic pathway. Overall, our observations indicate that soluble 4R0N tau abrogates the dynamics of the endolysosomal system, autophagy, and affects the trafficking of APP. Since the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs during its progression through the endocytic pathway, our results suggest that the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) might also be modulated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Functional Connectivity of Successful Picture-Naming: Age-Specific Organization and the Effect of Engaging in Stimulating Activities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.535770</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a lifelong process that starts at birth. Throughout the course of their life, individuals are exposed to various levels of stimulating activities. A higher level of engagement in such activities is suspected to protect against the normal course of cognitive aging or the cognitive manifestations of age-related brain diseases. However, the exact mechanism underlying such protective action remains unclear. The concept of the neurocognitive reserve was introduced to refer to the hypothesis that engagement in stimulating activities shapes brain structure and function, thus indirectly allowing for better preserved cognitive abilities. Although it is known that word production is among the best-preserved cognitive abilities in aging, the underlying neurofunctional mechanisms that allow this relative preservation are still unknown, and it is still unclear how engagement in stimulating activities affects these processes. The objective of this study is to describe the brain functional connectivity patterns associated with picture-naming abilities in younger and older adults with varying levels of engagement in stimulating activities, as a proxy for neurocognitive reserve. A mediation analysis was applied to determine whether the association between reserve proxies and naming accuracy is dependent on task FC. Results show that naming accuracy depends on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) functional decoupling in both younger and older adults but through different pathways. While high-performing older adults rely on the asynchronization of this area from motor speech regions’ activity, the best-performing younger adults rely on the functional decoupling with language-related regions. Mediation analysis reveals that the PCC decoupling mediates the relationship between the level of engagement in stimulating activities and naming accuracy in younger adults, but not in older adults. These findings suggest that reserve-related mechanisms may be more critical for naming in early adult life, while older adults’ neurofunctional organization may benefit more from a lifetime of acquired knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Emergence of non-canonical parvalbumin-containing interneurons in hippocampus of a murine model of Type I lissencephaly</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62373</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62373</link>
	<description>Type I lissencephaly is a neuronal migration disorder caused by haploinsuffiency of the &lt;i&gt;PAFAH1B1&lt;/i&gt; (mouse: &lt;i&gt;Pafah1b1&lt;/i&gt;) gene and is characterized by brain malformation, developmental delays, and epilepsy. Here, we investigate the impact of &lt;i&gt;Pafah1b1&lt;/i&gt; mutation on the cellular migration, morphophysiology, microcircuitry and transcriptomics of mouse hippocampal CA1 parvalbumin-containing inhibitory interneurons (PV+INTs). We find that WT PV+INTs consist of two physiological subtypes (80% fast-spiking (FS), 20% non-fast-spiking (NFS)) and four morphological subtypes. We find that cell-autonomous mutations within interneurons disrupts morphophysiological development of PV+INTs and results in the emergence of a non-canonical 'intermediate spiking (IS)' subset of PV+INTs. We also find that now dominant IS/NFS cells are prone to entering depolarization block, causing them to temporarily lose the ability to initiate action potentials and control network excitation, potentially promoting seizures. Finally, single-cell nuclear RNAsequencing of PV+INTs revealed several misregulated genes related to morphogenesis, cellular excitability, and synapse formation.</description>

	<title>eLife: MicroRNAs of the miR-17~92 family maintain adipose tissue macrophage homeostasis by sustaining IL-10 expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55676</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55676</link>
	<description>Macrophages are critically involved in not only immune and inflammatory responses but also in maintenance of metabolic fitness of organisms. Combined genetic deficiency of three clusters in the miR-17~92 family drastically shifted macrophage phenotypes towards the inflammatory spectrum characterized by heightened production of pro-inflammatory mediator TNF and diminished expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Consequently, macrophages residing in the adipose tissues from myeloid-specific miRNA triple knockout mice spontaneously developed inflammatory phenotypes and displayed alterations of overall physiological conditions as evidenced by obesity and compromised glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 family miRNAs sustained IL-10 production by promoting transcription of the &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; gene, which is secondary to downregulation of &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; by transcription factor YY1, a direct target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs. Together, these results identified miR-17~92 family miRNAs as crucial regulators of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and exemplified how macrophage-intrinsic regulatory circuit exerted impactful influence on general physiology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Working Memory Capacities Neurally Dissociate: Evidence from Acute Stroke</title>

	<description>Substantial behavioral evidence implies the existence of separable working memory (WM) components for maintaining phonological and semantic information. In contrast, only a few studies have addressed the neural basis of phonological vs. semantic WM using functional neuroimaging and none has used a lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) approach. Here we address this gap, reporting a multivariate LSM study of phonological and semantic WM for 94 individuals at the acute stage of left hemisphere stroke. Testing at the acute stage avoids issues of brain reorganization and the adoption of patient strategies for task performance. The LSM analyses for each WM component controlled for the other WM component and semantic and phonological knowledge at the single word level. For phonological WM, the regions uncovered included the supramarginal gyrus, argued to be the site of phonological storage, and several cortical and subcortical regions plausibly related to inner rehearsal. For semantic WM, inferior frontal regions and the angular gyrus were uncovered. The findings thus provide converging evidence for separable systems for phonological and semantic WM that are distinguished from the systems supporting long-term knowledge representations in those domains.</description>

	<description>Mood disorders (MD) are a major burden on society as their biology remains poorly understood, challenging both diagnosis and therapy. Among many observed biological dysfunctions, homeostatic dysregulation, such as metabolic syndrome (MeS), shows considerable comorbidity with MD. Recently, CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1), a regulator of brain metabolism, was proposed as a promising factor to understand this relationship. Searching for imaging biomarkers and associating them with pathophysiological mechanisms using preclinical models, can provide significant insight into these complex psychiatric diseases and help the development of personalized healthcare. Here, we used neuroimaging technologies to show that deletion of Crtc1 in mice leads to an imaging fingerprint of hippocampal metabolic impairment related to depressive-like behavior. By identifying the underlying molecular/physiological origin, we could assign an energy-boosting mood-stabilizing treatment, ebselen, which rescued behavior and neuroimaging markers. Finally, our results point towards the GABAergic system as a potential therapeutic target for behavioral dysfunctions related to metabolic disorders. This study provides new insights on Crtc1's and MeS's relationship to MD and establishes depression-related markers with clinical potential.</description>

	<description>Loss of metabolic homeostasis is one of the hallmarks of the aging process that might contribute to pathogenesis by creating a permissive landscape over which neurodegenerative diseases can take hold. AMPK, a conserved energy sensor, extends lifespan and is protective in some neurodegenerative models. AMPK regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and morphology, however, whether mitochondrial regulation causally links AMPK to protection against loss of neuronal function with aging and diseases remains unclear. Here we use an associative learning protocol in C. elegans as a readout of neuronal function and show that AMPK activation enhances associative learning and prevents age-related loss of learning capacity. AMPK promotes neuronal mitochondrial fusion and driving mitochondrial fragmentation via fzo-1 deletion blocks AMPK's effects on associative learning. Restoring mitochondrial fusion capacity specifically in the neurons rescues learning capacity downstream of AMPK. Finally, AMPK activation rescues neuronal A{beta}42 induced loss of associative learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeting neuronal metabolic flexibility may be a viable therapeutic option to restore neuronal function in the context of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The human ApoE4 variant reduces functional recovery and neuronal sprouting after incomplete spinal cord injury in male mice</title>

	<description>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating form of neurotrauma. Patients who carry one or two ApoE4 alleles show worse functional outcomes and longer hospital stays after SCI but the cellular and molecular underpinnings for this genetic link remain poorly understood. Thus, there is a great need to generate animal models to accurately replicate the genetic determinants of outcomes after SCI to spur development of treatments that improve physical function. Here, we examined outcomes after a moderate contusion SCI of transgenic mice expressing human ApoE3 or ApoE4. ApoE4 mice have worse locomotor function and coordination after SCI. Histological examination revealed greater glial staining in ApoE4 mice after SCI associated with reduced levels of neuronal sprouting markers. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that subcellular processes (SCPs), such as extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses, were highly-ranked among upregulated genes at 7 days after SCI in ApoE4 variants. Conversely, SCPs related to neuronal action potential and neuron projection development were increased in ApoE3 mice at 21 days. In summary, our results reveal a clinically relevant SCI mouse model that recapitulates the influence of ApoE genotypes on post-SCI function in individuals who carry these alleles and suggest that the mechanisms underlying worse recovery for ApoE4 animals involve glial activation and loss of sprouting and synaptic activity.</description>

	<description>Fear and anxiety are complex physiological states aimed at promoting adaptive behaviors. They are also core symptoms of many neuropsychiatric disorders; yet, our knowledge of the underlying biological correlates remains fragmented. Non-human primate models are critical for our understanding of mechanisms associated with complex higher-order behavioral phenotypes. Here we investigated individual variations in innate fear responses to a snake stimulus in free-ranging rhesus macaques and discovered an unusual bimodal distribution of fearful and fearless behavior, likely as a result of an environmental insult by a hurricane. In a translational approach, we discovered a DNA methylation profile associated with fear behavior in these monkeys. We also found evidence that this epigenetic signature is associated with innate fear responses in humans in the form of acoustic startle. Our data highlight the importance and translational utility of non-human primate models for neuropsychiatric research and provide a potential epigenetic signature of innate fear.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Canard analysis reveals why a large Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; window current promotes early afterdepolarizations in cardiac myocytes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Joshua Kimrey, Theodore Vo, Richard Bertram&lt;/p&gt;

The pumping of blood through the heart is due to a wave of muscle contractions that are in turn due to a wave of electrical activity initiated at the sinoatrial node. At the cellular level, this wave of electrical activity corresponds to the sequential excitation of electrically coupled cardiac cells. Under some conditions, the normally-long action potentials of cardiac cells are extended even further by small oscillations called early afterdepolarizations (EADs) that can occur either during the plateau phase or repolarizing phase of the action potential. Hence, cellular EADs have been implicated as a driver of potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. One of the major determinants of cellular EAD production and repolarization failure is the size of the overlap region between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel activation and inactivation, called the window region. In this article, we interpret the role of the window region in terms of the fast-slow structure of a low-dimensional model for ventricular action potential generation. We demonstrate that the effects of manipulation of the size of the window region can be understood from the point of view of canard theory. We use canard theory to explain why enlarging the size of the window region elicits EADs and why shrinking the window region can eliminate them. We also use the canard mechanism to explain why some manipulations in the size of the window region have a stronger influence on cellular electrical behavior than others. This dynamical viewpoint gives predictive power that is beyond that of the biophysical explanation alone while also uncovering a common mechanism for phenomena observed in experiments on both atrial and ventricular cardiac cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Avz3Jy_sx2s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Statistical learning and probabilistic prediction are fundamental processes in auditory cognition. A prominent computational model of these processes is Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), a variable-order Markov model that learns by internalizing &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-grams from training sequences. However, PPM has limitations as a cognitive model: in particular, it has a perfect memory that weights all historic observations equally, which is inconsistent with memory capacity constraints and recency effects observed in human cognition. We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies—one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment—we show how this decay kernel improves the model’s predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection. The resulting model is available in our new open-source R package, &lt;i&gt;ppm&lt;/i&gt; (https://github.com/pmcharrison/ppm).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wnRZs66WMSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of clinical trials of selective B‐cell depletion in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary progressive MS has led to a conceptual shift in the understanding of MS pathogenesis, away from the classical model in which T cells were the sole central actors and toward a more complex paradigm with B cells having an essential role in both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process. The role of B cells in MS was selected as the topic of the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Charcot Foundation. Results of the meeting are presented in this concise review, which recaps current concepts underlying the biology and therapeutic rationale behind B‐cell–directed therapeutics in MS, and proposes strategies to optimize the use of existing anti–B‐cell treatments and provide future directions for research in this area.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Discordant Monozygotic Parkinson Disease Twins: Role of Mitochondrial Integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25942?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25942?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 5 pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real‐time PCR to quantify gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma coactivator‐α (&lt;i&gt;PPARGC1A&lt;/i&gt;) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate disease‐related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Regional Brain Growth Trajectories in Fetuses with Congenital Heart Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25940?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25940?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with abnormal brain development in utero. We applied innovative fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to determine whether reduced fetal cerebral substrate delivery impacts the brain globally, or in a region‐specific pattern. Our novel design included two control groups, one with and the other without a family history of CHD, to explore the contribution of shared genes and/or fetal environment to brain development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2018, we enrolled 179 pregnant women into 4 groups: “HLHS/TGA” fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or transposition of the great arteries (TGA), diagnoses with lowest fetal cerebral substrate delivery; “CHD‐other,” with other CHD diagnoses; “CHD‐related,” healthy with a CHD family history; and “optimal control,” healthy without a family history. Two MRIs were obtained between 18 and 40 weeks gestation. Random effect regression models assessed group differences in brain volumes and relationships to hemodynamic variables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HLHS/TGA (n = 24), CHD‐other (50), and CHD‐related (34) groups each had generally smaller brain volumes than the optimal controls (71). Compared with CHD‐related, the HLHS/TGA group had smaller subplate (−13.3% [standard error = 4.3%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and intermediate (−13.7% [4.3%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) zones, with a similar trend in ventricular zone (−7.1% [1.9%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.07). These volumetric reductions were associated with lower cerebral substrate delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetuses with CHD, especially those with lowest cerebral substrate delivery, show a region‐specific pattern of small brain volumes and impaired brain growth before 32 weeks gestation. The brains of fetuses with CHD were more similar to those of CHD‐related than optimal controls, suggesting genetic or environmental factors also contribute. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity by post‐weaning obesogenic diet intake in male rats: Influence of the duration of diet exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23278?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23278?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Effects of adolescent experience of food restriction and exercise on spatial learning and open field exploration of female rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23275?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23275?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Being widespread across different brain systems, the neuromodulatory action of acetylcholine plays a critical role in a vast range of neural processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. In this study, we describe the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA. The presence of ChAT in brain nuclei harboring feedback projections directed to primary centers of the electrosensory pathway supports and extends our previous findings on a neuromodulatory effect of acetylcholine on the early stages of electrosensory processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator of many central nervous system processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. The present study describes the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Distinct groups of cholinergic cells were observed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and hindbrain. These included cholinergic cell groups typically identified in other vertebrate brains, for example, motor neurons. Using both in vitro and ex vivo neuronal tracing methods, we identified two new cholinergic connections leading to novel hypotheses on their functional significance. Projections to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP) arise from isthmic nuclei, possibly including the nucleus lateralis valvulae (nLV) and the isthmic nucleus (nI). The nP is a central component of all electrosensory feedback pathways to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). We have previously shown that some neurons in nP, TS, and tectum express muscarinic receptors. We hypothesize that, based on nLV/nI cell responses in other teleosts and isthmic connectivity in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;, the isthmic connections to nP, TS, and tectum modulate responses to electrosensory and/or visual motion and, in particular, to looming/receding stimuli. In addition, we found that the octavolateral efferent (OE) nucleus is the likely source of cholinergic fibers innervating the ELL. In other teleosts, OE inhibits octavolateral hair cells during locomotion. In gymnotiform fish, OE may also act on the first central processing stage and, we hypothesize, implement corollary discharge modulation of electrosensory processing during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider problems where multiple predictions can be considered correct,
but only one of them is given as supervision. This setting differs from both
the regression and class-conditional generative modelling settings: in the
former, there is a unique observed output for each input, which is provided as
supervision; in the latter, there are many observed outputs for each input, and
many are provided as supervision. Applying either regression methods and
conditional generative models to the present setting often results in a model
that can only make a single prediction for each input. We explore several
problems that have this property and develop an approach that can generate
multiple high-quality predictions given the same input. As a result, it can be
used to generate high-quality outputs that are different from the observed
output.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain fiber tracts are widely used in studying brain diseases, which may lead
to a better understanding of how disease affects the brain. The segmentation of
brain fiber tracts assumed enormous importance in disease analysis. In this
paper, we propose a novel vector field streamline clustering framework for
brain fiber tract segmentations. Brain fiber tracts are firstly expressed in a
vector field and compressed using the streamline simplification algorithm.
After streamline normalization and regular-polyhedron projection,
high-dimensional features of each fiber tract are computed and fed to the IDEC
clustering algorithm. We also provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations
of the IDEC clustering method and QB clustering method. Our clustering results
of the brain fiber tracts help researchers gain perception of the brain
structure. This work has the potential to automatically create a robust fiber
bundle template that can effectively segment brain fiber tracts while enabling
consistent anatomical tract identification.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Formation of working memory in a spiking neuron network accompanied by astrocytes. (arXiv:2011.01750v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01750</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01750</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a biologically plausible computational model of working memory
(WM) implemented by the spiking neuron network (SNN) interacting with a network
of astrocytes. SNN is modelled by the synaptically coupled Izhikevich neurons
with a non-specific architecture connection topology. Astrocytes generating
calcium signals are connected by local gap junction diffusive couplings and
interact with neurons by chemicals diffused in the extracellular space. Calcium
elevations occur in response to the increase of concentration of a
neurotransmitter released by spiking neurons when a group of them fire
coherently. In turn, gliotransmitters are released by activated astrocytes
modulating the strengths of synaptic connections in the corresponding neuronal
group. Input information is encoded as two-dimensional patterns of short
applied current pulses stimulating neurons. The output is taken from
frequencies of transient discharges of corresponding neurons. We show how a set
of information patterns with quite significant overlapping areas can be
uploaded into the neuron-astrocyte network and stored for several seconds.
Information retrieval is organised by the application of a cue pattern
representing the one from the memory set distorted by noise. We found that
successful retrieval with level of the correlation between recalled pattern and
ideal pattern more than 90% is possible for multi-item WM task. Having analysed
the dynamical mechanism of WM formation, we discovered that astrocytes
operating at a time scale of a dozen of seconds can successfully store traces
of neuronal activations corresponding to information patterns. In the retrieval
stage, the astrocytic network selectively modulates synaptic connections in SNN
leading to the successful recall. Information and dynamical characteristics of
the proposed WM model agrees with classical concepts and other WM models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The combination and aggregation of knowledge from multiple neural networks
can be commonly seen in the form of mixtures of experts. However, such
combinations are usually done using networks trained on the same tasks, with
little mention of the combination of heterogeneous pre-trained networks,
especially in the data-free regime. This paper proposes multiple data-free
methods for the combination of heterogeneous neural networks, ranging from the
utilization of simple output logit statistics, to training specialized gating
networks. The gating networks decide whether specific inputs belong to specific
networks based on the nature of the expert activations generated. The
experiments revealed that the gating networks, including the universal gating
approach, constituted the most accurate approach, and therefore represent a
pragmatic step towards applications with heterogeneous mixtures of experts in a
data-free regime. The code for this project is hosted on github at

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To improve device robustness, a highly desirable key feature of a competitive
data-driven acoustic scene classification (ASC) system, a novel two-stage
system based on fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Our
two-stage system leverages on an ad-hoc score combination based on two CNN
classifiers: (i) the first CNN classifies acoustic inputs into one of three
broad classes, and (ii) the second CNN classifies the same inputs into one of
ten finer-grained classes. Three different CNN architectures are explored to
implement the two-stage classifiers, and a frequency sub-sampling scheme is
investigated. Moreover, novel data augmentation schemes for ASC are also
investigated. Evaluated on DCASE 2020 Task 1a, our results show that the
proposed ASC system attains a state-of-the-art accuracy on the development set,
where our best system, a two-stage fusion of CNN ensembles, delivers a 81.9%
average accuracy among multi-device test data, and it obtains a significant
improvement on unseen devices. Finally, neural saliency analysis with class
activation mapping (CAM) gives new insights on the patterns learnt by our
models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cognitive assessments represent the most common clinical routine
for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given a large number of
cognitive assessment tools and time-limited office visits, determining a proper
set of cognitive tests is a widely studied topic. Most existing studies aim to
create selection guidelines for a targeted population but not for each
individual subject. In this manuscript, we develop a machine learning paradigm
enabling personalized cognitive assessments prioritization. Method: We adapt a
newly developed learning-to-rank method PLTR to implement our paradigm. This
method learns the latent scoring function that pushes the most effective
cognitive assessments on top of the prioritization list. We also extend PLTR to
better separate the most effective cognitive assessments and the less effective
ones. Results: Our empirical study on the ADNI data shows that the proposed
paradigm outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on identifying and
prioritizing individual-specific cognitive biomarkers. We conduct experiments
in cross validation and level-out validation settings. In the two settings, our
paradigm significantly outperforms the best baselines with improvement as much
as 22.1% and 19.7%, respectively, on prioritizing cognitive features.
Conclusions: The proposed paradigm achieves superior performance on
prioritizing cognitive biomarkers. The top ranked cognitive biomarkers have the
potential to aid personalized diagnosis and disease subtyping, and to make
progress towards enabling precision medicine in AD.

learn to predict and imitate the behavior of an observed swarm of agents in a
centralized manner. Tested on artificially generated swarm motion data, the
network achieves high levels of prediction accuracy and imitation authenticity.
We compare our model to previous approaches for modelling interaction systems
and show how modifying components of other models gradually approaches the
performance of ours. Finally, we also discuss an extension of SwarmNet that can
deal with nondeterministic, noisy, and uncertain environments, as often found
in robotics applications.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Postnatal Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Treatments Prevent Early Ketamine-Induced Cortical Dysfunctions in Adult Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early brain insult, interfering with its maturation, may result in psychotic-like disturbances in adult life. Redox dysfunctions and neuroinflammation contribute to long-term psychiatric consequences due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Here, we investigated the effects of early pharmacological modulation of the redox and inflammatory states, through celastrol, and indomethacin administration, on reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase 1, SOD1, glutathione, GSH, and catalase, CAT), as well as of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-α, interleukin-6, IL-6, and interleukin-1 beta, IL-1β), in the prefrontal cortex of adult mice exposed to a neurotoxic insult, i.e. ketamine administration, in postnatal life. Early celastrol or indomethacin prevented ketamine-induced elevations in cortical ROS production. MDA levels in ketamine-treated mice, also administered with celastrol, were comparable with the control ones. Indomethacin also prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation following early ketamine administration. Whereas no significant differences were detected in SOD1, GSH, and CAT levels between ketamine and saline-administered mice, celastrol elevated the cortical amount of these antioxidant enzymes and the same effect was induced by indomethacin per se. Both celastrol and indomethacin prevented ketamine-induced enhancement in TNF-α and IL-1β levels, however, they had no effects on increased IL-6 amount resulting from ketamine exposure in postnatal life. In conclusion, our data suggest that an early increase in cortical ROS scavenging and reduction of lipid peroxidation, via the enhancement of antioxidant defense, together with inhibition of neuroinflammation, may represent a therapeutic opportunity against psychotic-like disturbances resulting, later in life, from the effects of a neurotoxic insult on the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Comparison of Common and Disease-Specific Post-translational Modifications of Pathological Tau Associated With a Wide Range of Tauopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.581936</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are the most common type of neurodegenerative proteinopathy, being characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The formation and morphologies of these tau inclusions, the distribution of the lesions and related metabolic changes in cytoplasm differ among different tauopathies. The aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences in the post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the pathological tau proteins. We analyzed sarkosyl-insoluble pathological tau proteins prepared from brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, globular glial tauopathy, and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonisms linked to chromosome 17 with tau inclusions using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In pathological tau proteins associated with a wide range of tauopathies, 170 PTMs in total were identified including new PTMs. Among them, common PTMs were localized in the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of the microtubule binding repeats and PTMs, which were considered to be disease-specific, were found in microtubule binding repeats forming filament core. These suggested that the differences in PTMs reflected the differences in tau filament core structures in each disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Horizontal Cell Feedback to Cone Photoreceptors in Mammalian Retina: Novel Insights From the GABA-pH Hybrid Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.595064</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How neurons in the eye feed signals back to photoreceptors to optimize sensitivity to patterns of light appears to be mediated by one or more unconventional mechanisms. Via these mechanisms, horizontal cells control photoreceptor synaptic gain and enhance key aspects of temporal and spatial center-surround receptive field antagonism. After the transduction of light energy into an electrical signal in photoreceptors, the next key task in visual processing is the transmission of an optimized signal to the follower neurons in the retina. For this to happen, the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from photoreceptors is carefully regulated via horizontal cell feedback, which acts as a thermostat to keep the synaptic transmission in an optimal range during changes to light patterns and intensities. Novel findings of a recently described model that casts a classical neurotransmitter system together with ion transport mechanisms to adjust the alkaline milieu outside the synapse are reviewed. This novel inter-neuronal messaging system carries feedback signals using two separate, but interwoven regulated systems. The complex interplay between these two signaling modalities, creating synaptic modulation-at-a-distance, has obscured it’s being defined. The foundations of our understanding of the feedback mechanism from horizontal cells to photoreceptors have been long established: Horizontal cells have broad receptive fields, suitable for providing surround inhibition, their membrane potential, a function of stimulus intensity and size, regulates inhibition of photoreceptor voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, and strong artificial pH buffering eliminates this action. This review compares and contrasts models of how these foundations are linked, focusing on a recent report in mammals that shows tonic horizontal cell release of GABA activating Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; permeable GABA autoreceptors. The membrane potential of horizontal cells provides the driving force for GABAR-mediated HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, alkalinizing the cleft when horizontal cells are hyperpolarized by light or adding to their depolarization in darkness and contributing to cleft acidification via NHE-mediated H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux. This model challenges interpretations of earlier studies that were considered to rule out a role for GABA in feedback to cones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Extracellular Vesicles Loaded miRNAs as Potential Modulators Shared Between Glioblastoma, and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.590034</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumor. Its poor prognosis is due to cell heterogeneity, invasiveness, and high vascularization that impede an efficient therapeutic approach. In the past few years, several molecular links connecting GBM to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were identified at preclinical and clinical level. In particular, giving the increasing critical role that epigenetic alterations play in both GBM and NDDs, we deeply analyzed the role of miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs acting epigenetic modulators in several key biological processes. Specific miRNAs, transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs), act as intercellular communication signals in both diseases. In this way, miRNA-loaded EVs modulate GBM tumorigenesis, as they spread oncogenic signaling within brain parenchyma, and control the aggregation of neurotoxic protein (Tau, Aβ-amyloid peptide, and α-synuclein) in NDDs. In this review, we highlight the most promising miRNAs linking GBM and NDDs playing a significant pathogenic role in both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons that innervate muscle, resulting in gradual paralysis and culminating in the inability to breathe or swallow. This neuronal degeneration occurs in a spatiotemporal manner from a point of onset in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that there is a molecule that spreads from cell-to-cell. There is strong evidence that the onset and progression of ALS pathology is a consequence of protein misfolding and aggregation. In line with this, a hallmark pathology of ALS is protein deposition and inclusion formation within motor neurons and surrounding glia of the proteins TAR DNA-binding protein 43, superoxide dismutase-1, or fused in sarcoma. Collectively, the observed protein aggregation, in conjunction with the spatiotemporal spread of symptoms, strongly suggests a prion-like propagation of protein aggregation occurs in ALS. In this review, we discuss the role of protein aggregation in ALS concerning protein homeostasis (proteostasis) mechanisms and prion-like propagation. Furthermore, we examine the experimental models used to investigate these processes, including in vitro assays, cultured cells, invertebrate models, and murine models. Finally, we evaluate the therapeutics that may best prevent the onset or spread of pathology in ALS and discuss what lies on the horizon for treating this currently incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Corticospinal tract impairment is no longer an absolute exclusion in the updated Movement Disorder Society Parkinson’s disease criteria. Triple stimulation technique (TST) is an accurate method to quantitatively assess the integrity and impairment of corticospinal pathway in a variety of neurological diseases. This study aims to evaluate the corticospinal tract impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients using TST.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Ten PD patients, 19 multiple-system atrophy parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) patients, and 12 healthy controls (HC) were sequentially recruited in this study. Information of age, disease duration, pyramidal signs, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;amp;Y) stage was obtained from all patients. The TST was assessed at right abductor digiti minimi for HCs and both sides for patients. The Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, and variance analysis was performed for continuous variables in comparing the difference among PD, MSA-P, and HC, plus the post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All subjects were age and gender matched. There was no significant difference in disease duration (p = 0.855), H-Y stage (p = 0.067), and the percentage of pyramidal signs present (p = 0.581) between MSA-P and PD patients. The mean TST ratio was 55.5 ± 32.2%, 81.7 ± 19.8%, and 96.8 ± 3.0% for PD, MSA-P, and HCs, correspondingly. PD patients had a significant lower TST amplitude ratio than MSA-P and HCs. The TST ratio of MSA-P was lower than HCs, but there was no significant difference (p = 0.160). Additionally, it was significantly higher in percentage of abnormal TST ratio between PD patients and MSA-P (p = 0.010).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Corticospinal tract impairment is not a rare manifestation in PD and can be quantitatively evaluated with TST. The result needs to be verified in amplified sample.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: P2X4R Overexpression Upregulates Interleukin-6 and Exacerbates 6-OHDA-Induced Dopaminergic Degeneration in a Rat Model of PD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580068</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains elusive. Current thinking suggests that the activation of microglia and the subsequent release of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) is a member of the P2X superfamily of ion channels activated by ATP. To study the possible effect of the ATP-P2X4R signal axis on IL-6 in PD, lentivirus carrying the P2X4R-overexpression gene or empty vector was injected into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats, followed by treatment of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or saline 1 week later. The research found the relative expression of P2X4R in the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat models was notably higher than that in the normal. And P2X4R overexpression could upregulate the expression of IL-6, reduce the amount of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN of PD rats, suggesting that P2X4R may mediate the production of IL-6 to damage DA neurons in the SN. Our data revealed the important role of P2X4R in modulating IL-6, which leads to neuroinflammation involved in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Longitudinal Macro/Microstructural Alterations of Different Callosal Subsections in Parkinson’s Disease Using Connectivity-Based Parcellation</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The corpus callosum (CC) is an important feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) not only in motor but also in non-motor functions. However, CC is not a homogeneous component, and the damage of specific subsection may contribute to corresponding clinical deficit.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of the study is to investigate the structural alterations of different callosal subsections cross-sectionally and longitudinally in PD and evaluate their relationships to clinical performance.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine PD patients who had been longitudinally reexamined and 82 normal controls (NC) were employed. According to their specific callosal–cortical connectivity, 3D CC was divided into five subsections (including prefrontal, premotor, motor, somatosensory, and temporal–parietal–occipital subsection). The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and volume of whole CC and its subsections were computed and compared between groups. Regression model was constructed to explore the relationships between callosal structure and clinical performance.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;At baseline, PD did not show any significant macro/microstructural difference compared with NC. During disease course, there was a decreased FA and increased MD of whole CC as well as its subsections (except temporal–parietal–occipital subsection), and the volume of motor subsection was decreased. Moreover, the FA of temporal–parietal–occipital subsection and volume of motor subsection were correlated with the mood domain at baseline, and the MD of somatosensory subsection was associated with the motor domain at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The structure of CC and its connectivity-specific subsections remain preserved at a relatively early stage in PD and are progressively disrupted during disease course. Besides, different callosal subsections possess specific associations with clinical performance in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Scientific conferences have an important role in the exchange of ideas and knowledge within the scientific community. Conferences also provide early-career researchers with opportunities to make themselves known within their field of research. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has brought traditional in-person conferences to a halt for the foreseeable future, the growth of virtual conferences has highlighted many of the disadvantages associated with the in-person format and demonstrated the advantages of moving these events online. Here, based on data from in-person and virtual conferences in a range of subjects, we describe how virtual conferences are more inclusive, more affordable, less time-consuming and more accessible worldwide, especially for early-career researchers. Making conferences more open and inclusive will provide both immediate and long-term benefits to the scientific community.</description>

	<title>eLife: Convergence of cortical types and functional motifs in the human mesiotemporal lobe</title>

	<description>The mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) is implicated in many cognitive processes, is compromised in numerous brain disorders, and exhibits a gradual cytoarchitectural transition from six-layered parahippocampal isocortex to three-layered hippocampal allocortex. Leveraging an ultra-high-resolution histological reconstruction of a human brain, our study showed that the dominant axis of MTL cytoarchitectural differentiation follows the iso-to-allocortical transition and depth-specific variations in neuronal density. Projecting the histology-derived MTL model to in-vivo functional MRI, we furthermore determined how its cytoarchitecture underpins its intrinsic effective connectivity and association to large-scale networks. Here, the cytoarchitectural gradient was found to underpin intrinsic effective connectivity of the MTL, but patterns differed along the anterior-posterior axis. Moreover, while the iso-to-allocortical gradient parametrically represented the multiple-demand relative to task-negative networks, anterior-posterior gradients represented transmodal versus unimodal networks. Our findings establish that the combination of micro- and macrostructural features allow the MTL to represent dominant motifs of whole-brain functional organization.</description>

	<title>eLife: Inter-membrane association of the Sec and BAM translocons for bacterial outer-membrane biogenesis</title>

	<description>The outer-membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is critical for surface adhesion, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and survival. The major constituent – hydrophobic b-barrel &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;uter-&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;embrane &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;roteins (OMPs) – are first secreted across the inner-membrane through the Sec-translocon for delivery to periplasmic chaperones &lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; SurA, which prevent aggregation. OMPs are then offloaded to the b-&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;arrel &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ssembly &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;achinery (BAM) in the outer-membrane for insertion and folding. We show the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;olo-&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;rans&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;ocon (HTL) – an assembly of the protein-channel core-complex SecYEG, the ancillary sub-complex SecDF, and the membrane 'insertase' YidC – contacts BAM through periplasmic domains of SecDF and YidC, ensuring efficient OMP maturation. Furthermore, the proton-motive-force (PMF) across the inner-membrane acts at distinct stages of protein secretion: (1) SecA-driven translocation through SecYEG; and (2) communication of conformational changes &lt;i&gt;via &lt;/i&gt;SecDF across the periplasm to BAM. The latter presumably drives efficient passage of OMPs. These interactions provide insights of inter-membrane organisation and communication, the importance of which is becoming increasingly apparent.</description>

	<title>eLife: Reconstruction of natural images from responses of primate retinal ganglion cells</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58516</link>
	<description>The visual message conveyed by a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) is often summarized by its spatial receptive field, but in principle also depends on the responses of other RGCs and natural image statistics. This possibility was explored by linear reconstruction of natural images from responses of the four numerically-dominant macaque RGC types. Reconstructions were highly consistent across retinas. The optimal reconstruction filter for each RGC – its visual message – reflected natural image statistics, and resembled the receptive field only when nearby, same-type cells were included. ON and OFF cells conveyed largely independent, complementary representations, and parasol and midget cells conveyed distinct features. Correlated activity and nonlinearities had statistically significant but minor effects on reconstruction. Simulated reconstructions, using linear-nonlinear cascade models of RGC light responses that incorporated measured spatial properties and nonlinearities, produced similar results. Spatiotemporal reconstructions exhibited similar spatial properties, suggesting that the results are relevant for natural vision.</description>

	<title>eLife: Rapid computations of spectrotemporal prediction error support perception of degraded speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58077</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58077</link>
	<description>Human speech perception can be described as Bayesian perceptual inference but how are these Bayesian computations instantiated neurally? We used magnetoencephalographic recordings of brain responses to degraded spoken words and experimentally manipulated signal quality and prior knowledge. We first demonstrate that spectrotemporal modulations in speech are more strongly represented in neural responses than alternative speech representations (e.g. spectrogram or articulatory features). Critically, we found an interaction between speech signal quality and expectations from prior written text on the quality of neural representations; increased signal quality enhanced neural representations of speech that mismatched with prior expectations, but led to greater suppression of speech that matched prior expectations. This interaction is a unique neural signature of prediction error computations and is apparent in neural responses within 100 ms of speech input. Our findings contribute to the detailed specification of a computational model of speech perception based on predictive coding frameworks.</description>

	<description>Overproduction (op) of proteins triggers cellular defects. One of the consequences of overproduction is the protein burden/cost, which is produced by an overloading of the protein synthesis process. However, the physiology of cells under a protein burden is not well characterized. We performed genetic profiling of protein burden by systematic analysis of genetic interactions between GFP-op, surveying both deletion and temperature-sensitive mutants in budding yeast. We also performed genetic profiling in cells with overproduction of triple-GFP (tGFP), and the nuclear export signal-containing tGFP (NES-tGFP). The mutants specifically interacted with GFP-op were suggestive of unexpected connections between actin-related processes like polarization and the protein burden, which was supported by morphological analysis. The tGFP-op interactions suggested that this protein probe overloads the proteasome, whereas those that interacted with NES-tGFP involved genes encoding components of the nuclear export process, providing a resource for further analysis of the protein burden and nuclear export overload.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A recurrent neural network framework for flexible and adaptive decision making based on sequence learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhewei Zhang, Huzi Cheng, Tianming Yang&lt;/p&gt;

The brain makes flexible and adaptive responses in a complicated and ever-changing environment for an organism’s survival. To achieve this, the brain needs to understand the contingencies between its sensory inputs, actions, and rewards. This is analogous to the statistical inference that has been extensively studied in the natural language processing field, where recent developments of recurrent neural networks have found many successes. We wonder whether these neural networks, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks in particular, reflect how the brain solves the contingency problem. Therefore, we build a GRU network framework inspired by the statistical learning approach of NLP and test it with four exemplar behavior tasks previously used in empirical studies. The network models are trained to predict future events based on past events, both comprising sensory, action, and reward events. We show the networks can successfully reproduce animal and human behavior. The networks generalize the training, perform Bayesian inference in novel conditions, and adapt their choices when event contingencies vary. Importantly, units in the network encode task variables and exhibit activity patterns that match previous neurophysiology findings. Our results suggest that the neural network approach based on statistical sequence learning may reflect the brain’s computational principle underlying flexible and adaptive behaviors and serve as a useful approach to understand the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7aA5WRiolew&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Testing structural identifiability by a simple scaling method</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mario Castro, Rob J. de Boer&lt;/p&gt;

Successful mathematical modeling of biological processes relies on the expertise of the modeler to capture the essential mechanisms in the process at hand and on the ability to extract useful information from empirical data. A model is said to be structurally unidentifiable, if different quantitative sets of parameters provide the same observable outcome. This is typical (but not exclusive) of partially observed problems in which only a few variables can be experimentally measured. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HAYuyv4tK4U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The noncoding small RNA SsrA is released by &lt;i&gt;Vibrio fischeri &lt;/i&gt;and modulates critical host responses</title>

The regulatory noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) of bacteria are key elements influencing gene expression; however, there has been little evidence that beneficial bacteria use these molecules to communicate with their animal hosts. We report here that the bacterial sRNA SsrA plays an essential role in the light-organ symbiosis between &lt;i&gt;Vibrio fischeri&lt;/i&gt; and the squid &lt;i&gt;Euprymna scolopes&lt;/i&gt;. The symbionts load SsrA into outer membrane vesicles, which are transported specifically into the epithelial cells surrounding the symbiont population in the light organ. Although an SsrA-deletion mutant (Δ&lt;i&gt;ssrA&lt;/i&gt;) colonized the host to a normal level after 24 h, it produced only 2/10 the luminescence per bacterium, and its persistence began to decline by 48 h. The host’s response to colonization by the Δ&lt;i&gt;ssrA&lt;/i&gt; strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the Δ&lt;i&gt;ssrA&lt;/i&gt; strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities. This study reveals the potential for a bacterial symbiont’s sRNAs not only to control its own activities but also to trigger critical responses promoting homeostasis in its host. In the absence of this communication, there are dramatic fitness consequences for both partners.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ky-s1sD_AiM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Hippocampal neurons with stable excitatory connectivity become part of neuronal representations</title>

Experiences are represented in the brain by patterns of neuronal activity. Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity—using dendritic spines as proxies—of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0J66rjU2rN0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During active tactile exploration, the dynamic patterns of touch are transduced to electrical signals and transformed by the brain into a mental representation of the object under investigation. This transformation from sensation to perception is thought to be a major function of the mammalian cortex. In primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons are major outputs to downstream areas that influence perception, decision-making, and motor control. We investigated self-motion and touch representations in L5 of S1 with juxtacellular loose-seal patch recordings of optogenetically identified excitatory neurons. We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch. Object location was decodable with submillimeter precision from the touch-evoked spike counts of a randomly sampled handful of these neurons. These representations of whisker angle during self-motion and touch were independent, both in the selection of which neurons were active and in the angle-tuning preference of coactive neurons. Thus, the output of S1 transiently shifts from a representation of self-motion to an independent representation of explored object location during active touch.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8D57Lxj_qPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The association between CT biomarkers of cerebral small vessel diseases and long‐term outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25949?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25949?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess whether cerebral small vessel disease CT biomarkers are associated with long‐term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prospective, community‐based cohort study of adults diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; June 2010 – 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; May 2013. A neuroradiologist rated the diagnostic brain CT for acute intracerebral hemorrhage features and small vessel disease biomarkers. We used severity of white matter lucencies and cerebral atrophy, and the number of lacunes to calculate the CT SVD score. We assessed the association between CT small vessel disease biomarkers and either death or death or dependence (modified Rankin scale scores 4‐6) one year after first‐ever intracerebral hemorrhage using logistic regression, adjusting for known predictors of outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within one year of intracerebral hemorrhage, 224 (56%) of 402 patients died. In separate models, one‐year death was associated with severe atrophy (aOR 2.54, 95%CI 1.44‐4.49, p=0.001) but not lacunes or severe white matter lucencies, and CT SVD sum score ≥1 (aOR 2.50, 95%CI 1.40‐4.45, p=0.002). Two hundred and seventy‐seven (73%) of 378 patients with modified Rankin scale data were dead or dependent at one year. In separate models, one‐year death or dependence was associated with severe atrophy (aOR 3.67, 95%CI 1.71‐7.89, p=0.001) and severe white matter lucencies (aOR 2.18, 95%CI 1.06‐4.51, p=0.035) but not lacunes, and CT SVD sum score ≥1 (aOR 2.81, 95%CI 1.45‐5.46, p=0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small vessel disease biomarkers on the diagnostic brain CT are associated with one‐year death and dependence after intracerebral hemorrhage, independent of known predictors of outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;An epilepsy‐associated ACTL6B variant captures neuronal hyperexcitability in a human induced pluripotent stem cell model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4de423bc-8f13-43d0-a778-f76ae2d4e8f7/jnr24747-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells harboring ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) variant display reduced expression and stability of ACTL6B protein and increased spontaneous neuronal activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTL6B is a component of the neuronal BRG1/brm‐associated factor (nBAF) complex, which is required for chromatin remodeling in postmitotic neurons. We recently reported biallelic pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;ACTL6B&lt;/i&gt; in patients diagnosed with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, subtype 76 (EIEE‐76), presenting with severe, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal central nervous system myelination. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their phenotype is unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis of ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) using &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; 3D protein modeling predictions and patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons. We found neurons derived from EIEE‐76 patients showed impaired accumulation of ACTL6B compared to unaffected relatives, caused by reduced protein stability. Furthermore, EIEE‐76 patient‐derived neurons had dysregulated nBAF target gene expression, including genes important for neuronal development and disease. Multielectrode array system analysis unveiled elevated electrophysiological activity of EIEE‐76 patients‐derived neurons, consistent with the patient phenotype. Taken together, our findings validate a new model for EIEE‐76 and reveal how reduced ACTL6B expression affects neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Characterization of mWake expression in the murine brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bbe4eb0a-2807-48de-a9bd-fa31d20acb36/cne25066-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) was first identified in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; as a clock‐output molecule that regulates the timing of sleep and arousal. There is a single homolog of WAKE (mWAKE/ANKFN1/NMF9) in mice, which has previously shown to be enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker. This present work surveys the brain expression pattern of mWAKE using multiple approaches. First, &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression is examined using RNAscope &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization. Second, mWAKE protein expression is investigated using two different transgenic animal models: an &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;V5&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mouse where a V5 tag is fused directly to the end of the protein and an &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;tdTomato‐2A‐Cre&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mouse where tdTomato is inserted in‐frame within the gene. Third, we analyze scRNA‐Seq data to characterize the molecular identity of &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt; neurons in the hypothalamus. These data reveal that mWAKE labels a distributed subset of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons across the brainstem, subcortical regions, and cortex, with significant expression in the hypothalamus. This study may provide a potential roadmap for future studies of the circadian regulation of distinct circuits and behaviors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure‐function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically‐based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and our data suggest that its basic role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus region), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non‐neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWAKE&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic processors like Loihi offer a promising alternative to
conventional computing modules for endowing constrained systems like micro air
vehicles (MAVs) with robust, efficient and autonomous skills such as take-off
and landing, obstacle avoidance, and pursuit. However, a major challenge for
using such processors on robotic platforms is the reality gap between
simulation and the real world. In this study, we present for the very first
time a fully embedded application of the Loihi neuromorphic chip prototype in a
flying robot. A spiking neural network (SNN) was evolved to compute the thrust
command based on the divergence of the ventral optic flow field to perform
autonomous landing. Evolution was performed in a Python-based simulator using
the PySNN library. The resulting network architecture consists of only 35
neurons distributed among 3 layers. Quantitative analysis between simulation
and Loihi reveals a root-mean-square error of the thrust setpoint as low as
0.005 g, along with a 99.8% matching of the spike sequences in the hidden
layer, and 99.7% in the output layer. The proposed approach successfully
bridges the reality gap, offering important insights for future neuromorphic
applications in robotics. Supplementary material is available at

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to optimize deep neural networks'
architecture for better accuracy or smaller computational cost and has recently
gained more research interests. Despite various successful approaches proposed
to solve the NAS task, the landscape of it, along with its properties, are
rarely investigated. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of studying the
landscape property thereof and propose to use the so-called Exploratory
Landscape Analysis (ELA) techniques for this goal. Taking a broad set of
designs of the deep convolutional network, we conduct extensive experimentation
to obtain their performance. Based on our analysis of the experimental results,
we observed high similarities between well-performing architecture designs,
which is then used to significantly narrow the search space to improve the
efficiency of any NAS algorithm. Moreover, we extract the ELA features over the
NAS landscapes on three common image classification data sets, MNIST, Fashion,
and CIFAR-10, which shows that the NAS landscape can be distinguished for those
three data sets. Also, when comparing to the ELA features of the well-known
Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) problem set, we found out that the
NAS landscapes surprisingly form a new problem class on its own, which can be
separated from all $24$ BBOB problems. Given this interesting observation, we,
therefore, state the importance of further investigation on selecting an
efficient optimizer for the NAS landscape as well as the necessity of
augmenting the current benchmark problem set.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability is the phenomena that describes action potential
generation due to a stimulus input. Commonly, neuronal excitability is divided
into two classes: Type I and Type II, both having different properties that
affect information processing, such as thresholding and gain scaling. These
properties can be mathematically studied using generalised phenomenological
models, such as the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and the mirrored FHN. The FHN model
shows that each excitability type corresponds to one specific type of
bifurcation in the phase plane: Type I underlies a saddle-node on invariant
cycle bifurcation, and Type II a Hopf bifurcation. The difficulty of modelling
Type I excitability is that it is not only represented by its underlying
bifurcation, but also should be able to generate frequency while maintaining a
small depolarising current. Using the mFHN model, we show that this situation
is possible without modifying the phase portrait, due to the incorporation of a
slow regenerative variable. We show that in the singular limit of the mFHN
model, the time-scale separation can be chosen such that there is a
configuration of a classical phase portrait that allows for SNIC bifurcation,
zero-frequency onset and a depolarising current, such as observed in Type I
excitability. Using the definition of slow conductance, g_s, we show that these
mathematical findings for excitability change are translatable to reduced
conductance based models and also relates to an experimentally measurable
quantity. This not only allows for a measure of excitability change, but also
relates the mathematical parameters that indicate a physiological Type I
excitability to parameters that can be tuned during experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the functional connectivity of brain sections associated with
fear-conditioned training is one of the methods of study of memory neural
networks. Before, the majority of studies focused on the functional
connectivity of the brain regions that are known for emotional processing such
as amygdala and areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the resting
state right after the formation of a fear-conditioned reflex. In the present
study authors applied the methods of the theory of graphs to search for changes
in the functional connectivity at the level of the brain in the resting state
in a week dynamics after the extinction of a conditioned reflex with partial
reinforcement. The most significant changes were observed in the functional
connectivity of the left parahippocampal area. In particular, the rostral part
of the left parahippocampal gyrus became the center of a new subnetwork
connected with the rostral part of the left hippocampus in all the sessions and
after the extinction of a conditioned reflex and the lateral part of the left
amygdala right after the extinction and a day after the extinction of a
conditioned reflex. A week after the extinction of a conditioned reflex, the
rostral part of the left parahippocampal gyrus also had more connections with
the areas of the middle frontal gyrus in comparison with the parameters of the
baseline resting state to the stimulus. Besides, these changes remained within
one week from the moment of the extinction of a conditioned reflex, which could
be explained by the chosen paradigm of conditioned reflex with partial
reinforcement that led to a slower extinction than a paradigm with full
reinforcement.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a survey of methods for pruning deep neural networks,
from algorithms first proposed for fully connected networks in the 1990s to the
recent methods developed for reducing the size of convolutional neural
networks. The paper begins by bringing together many different algorithms by
categorising them based on the underlying approach used. It then focuses on
three categories: methods that use magnitude-based pruning, methods that
utilise clustering to identify redundancy, and methods that utilise sensitivity
analysis. Some of the key influencing studies within these categories are
presented to illuminate the underlying approaches and results achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most studies on pruning present results from empirical evaluations, which are
distributed in the literature as new architectures, algorithms and data sets
have evolved with time. This paper brings together the reported results from
some key papers in one place by providing a resource that can be used to
quickly compare reported results, and trace studies where specific methods,
data sets and architectures have been used.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Distraction by auditory novelty during reading: Evidence for disruption in saccade planning, but not saccade execution. (arXiv:2011.00163v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Novel or unexpected sounds that deviate from an otherwise repetitive sequence
of the same sound cause behavioural distraction. Recent work has suggested that
distraction also occurs during reading as fixation durations increased when a
deviant sound was presented at the fixation onset of words. The present study
tested the hypothesis that this increase in fixation durations occurs due to
saccadic inhibition. This was done by manipulating the temporal onset of sounds
relative to the fixation onset of words in the text. If novel sounds cause
saccadic inhibition, they should be more distracting when presented during the
second half of fixations when saccade programming usually takes place.
Participants read single sentences and heard a 120 ms sound when they fixated
five target words in the sentence. On most occasions (p= 0.9), the same sine
wave tone was presented (&quot;standard&quot;), while on the remaining occasions (p= 0.1)
a new sound was presented (&quot;novel&quot;). Critically, sounds were played either
during the first half of the fixation (0 ms delay) or during the second half of
the fixation (120 ms delay). Consistent with the saccadic inhibition
hypothesis, novel sounds led to longer fixation durations in the 120 ms
compared to the 0 ms delay condition. However, novel sounds did not generally
influence the execution of the subsequent saccade. These results suggest that
unexpected sounds have a rapid influence on saccade planning, but not saccade
execution.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research in photonic computing has flourished due to the proliferation of
optoelectronic components on photonic integration platforms. Photonic
integrated circuits have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks,
providing a framework for a new class of information processing machines.
Algorithms running on such hardware have the potential to address the growing
demand for machine learning and artificial intelligence, in areas such as
medical diagnosis, telecommunications, and high-performance and scientific
computing. In parallel, the development of neuromorphic electronics has
highlighted challenges in that domain, in particular, related to processor
latency. Neuromorphic photonics offers sub-nanosecond latencies, providing a
complementary opportunity to extend the domain of artificial intelligence.
Here, we review recent advances in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems,
discuss current and future challenges, and outline the advances in science and
technology needed to meet those challenges.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although perceptual (dis)similarity between sensory stimuli seems akin to
distance, measuring the Euclidean distance between vector representations of
auditory stimuli is a poor estimator of subjective dissimilarity. In hearing,
nonlinear response patterns, interactions between stimulus components, temporal
effects, and top-down modulation transform the information contained in
incoming frequency-domain stimuli in a way that seems to preserve some notion
of distance, but not that of familiar Euclidean space. This work proposes that
transformations applied to auditory stimuli during hearing can be modeled as a
function mapping stimulus points to their representations in a perceptual
space, inducing a Riemannian distance metric. A dataset was collected in a
subjective listening experiment, the results of which were used to explore
approaches (biologically inspired, data-driven, and combinations thereof) to
approximating the perceptual map. Each of the proposed measures achieved
comparable or stronger correlations with subjective ratings (r ~ 0.8) compared
to state-of-the-art audio quality measures.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a simple interpolation-based method for the efficient
approximation of gradients in neural ODE models. We compare it with the reverse
dynamic method (known in the literature as &quot;adjoint method&quot;) to train neural
ODEs on classification, density estimation, and inference approximation tasks.
We also propose a theoretical justification of our approach using logarithmic
norm formalism. As a result, our method allows faster model training than the
reverse dynamic method that was confirmed and validated by extensive numerical
experiments for several standard benchmarks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: BANANAS: Bayesian Optimization with Neural Architectures for Neural Architecture Search. (arXiv:1910.11858v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11858</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past half-decade, many methods have been considered for neural
architecture search (NAS). Bayesian optimization (BO), which has long had
success in hyperparameter optimization, has recently emerged as a very
promising strategy for NAS when it is coupled with a neural predictor. Recent
work has proposed different instantiations of this framework, for example,
using Bayesian neural networks or graph convolutional networks as the
predictive model within BO. However, the analyses in these papers often focus
on the full-fledged NAS algorithm, so it is difficult to tell which individual
components of the framework lead to the best performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we give a thorough analysis of the &quot;BO + neural predictor&quot;
framework by identifying five main components: the architecture encoding,
neural predictor, uncertainty calibration method, acquisition function, and
acquisition optimization strategy. We test several different methods for each
component and also develop a novel path-based encoding scheme for neural
architectures, which we show theoretically and empirically scales better than
other encodings. Using all of our analyses, we develop a final algorithm called
BANANAS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAS search spaces. We
adhere to the NAS research checklist (Lindauer and Hutter 2019) to facilitate
best practices, and our code is available at
https://github.com/naszilla/naszilla.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Lateral Preoptic Area and Its Projection to the VTA Regulate VTA Activity and Drive Complex Reward Behaviors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) underlies motivation and reinforcement of natural rewards. The lateral preoptic area (LPO) is an anterior hypothalamic brain region that sends direct projections to the VTA and to other brain structures known to regulate VTA activity. Here, we investigated the functional connection between the LPO and subpopulations of VTA neurons and explored the reinforcing and valence qualities of the LPO in rats. We found that the LPO and the LPO→VTA pathway inhibit the activity of VTA GABA neurons and have mixed effects on VTA dopamine neurons. Furthermore, we found that the LPO supports operant responding but drives avoidance, and we explored the apparent discrepancy between these two results. Finally, using fiber photometry, we show that the LPO signals aversive events but not rewarding events. Together, our findings demonstrate that the LPO modulates the activity of the VTA and drives motivated behavior and represents an overlooked modulator of reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Genetic Risk, Vascular Function, and Subjective Cognitive Complaints Predict Objective Cognitive Function in Healthy Older Adults: Results From the Brain in Motion Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571683</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571683</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with subjective memory complaints. Approximately half of those with subjective memory complaints have objective cognitive impairment. Previous studies have provided evidence of an association between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia progression. Also, aging is a significant risk factor for vascular pathology that may underlie at least some of the cognitive changes. This study investigates the relative contribution of subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), vascular function, and genetic risk for dementia in predicting objective cognitive performance. Multiple regression and relative importance analysis were used to investigate the relative contribution of vascular function, self-reported SCC, and dementia genetic risk, in predicting objective cognition in a sample of 238 healthy community-dwelling older adults. Age, sex, premorbid cognitive abilities, subjective verbal memory complaints, higher cerebrovascular blood flow during submaximal exercise, and certain dementia risk alleles were significant predictors of worse objective verbal memory performance (p &amp;lt; 0.001, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 35.2–36.4%). Using relative importance analysis, subjective verbal memory complaints, and certain dementia risk alleles contributed more variance than cerebrovascular measures. These results suggest that age-related changes in memory in healthy older adults can be predicted by subjective memory complaints, genetic risk, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582079</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common disabling motor symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the potential pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 22 patients with PD with FOG (PD-FOG), 28 patients with PD without FOG (PD-nFOG), and 33 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. Degree centrality (DC)—a graph theory-based measurement of global connectivity at the voxel level by measuring the number of instantaneous functional connections between one region and the rest of the brain—can map brain hubs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. DC was used to explore alterations in the centrality of PD-FOG correlated with brain node levels. PD-FOG cognitive network dysfunction was further revealed via a seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. In addition, correlation analyses were carried out between clinical symptoms and acquired connectivity measurement.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared to the PD-nFOG group, the PD-FOG group showed remarkably increased DC values in the right middle frontal gyrus (RMFG). There were no significant differences in other gray matter regions. Importantly, the clinical severity of FOG was related to the mean DC values in the RMFG. This brain region served as a seed in secondary seed-based FC analysis, and we further found FC changes in the right precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Increased RMFG activity and FC network alterations in the middle frontal cortex with the precuneus, inferior, and SFG, and the cerebellum may have great potential in brain dysfunction in PD with FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Photoreceptor Degeneration in Pro23His Transgenic Rats (Line 3) Involves Autophagic and Necroptotic Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor death contributes to 50% of irreversible vision loss in the western world. Pro23His (P23H) transgenic albino rat strains are widely used models for the most common rhodopsin gene mutation associated with the autosomal dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa. However, the mechanism(s) by which photoreceptor death occurs are not well understood and were the principal aim of this study. We first used electroretinogram recording and optical coherence tomography to confirm the time course of functional and structural loss. Electroretinogram analyses revealed significantly decreased rod photoreceptor (a-wave), bipolar cell (b-wave) and amacrine cell responses (oscillatory potentials) from P30 onward. The cone-mediated b-wave was also decreased from P30. TUNEL analysis showed extensive cell death at P18, with continued labeling detected until P30. Focused gene expression arrays indicated activation of, apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis in whole retina from P14-18. However, analysis of mitochondrial permeability changes (ΔΨm) using JC-1 dye, combined with immunofluorescence markers for caspase-dependent (cleaved caspase-3) and caspase-independent (AIF) cell death pathways, indicated mitochondrial-mediated cell death was not a major contributor to photoreceptor death. By contrast, reverse-phase protein array data combined with RIPK3 and phospho-MLKL immunofluorescence indicated widespread necroptosis as the predominant mechanism of photoreceptor death. These findings highlight the complexity of mechanisms involved in photoreceptor death in the Pro23His rat model of degeneration and suggest therapies that target necroptosis should be considered for their potential to reduce photoreceptor death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Capturing Human Interaction in the Virtual Age: A Perspective on the Future of fNIRS Hyperscanning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in video conferencing capabilities combined with dramatic socio-dynamic shifts brought about by COVID-19, have redefined the ways in which humans interact in modern society. From business meetings to medical exams, or from classroom instruction to yoga class, virtual interfacing has permeated nearly every aspect of our daily lives. A seemingly endless stream of technological advances combined with our newfound reliance on virtual interfacing makes it likely that humans will continue to use this modern form of social interaction into the future. However, emergent evidence suggests that virtual interfacing may not be equivalent to face-to-face interactions. Ultimately, too little is currently understood about the mechanisms that underlie human interactions over the virtual divide, including how these mechanisms differ from traditional face-to-face interaction. Here, we propose functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning—simultaneous measurement of two or more brains—as an optimal approach to quantify potential neurocognitive differences between virtual and in-person interactions. We argue that increased focus on this understudied domain will help elucidate the reasons why virtual conferencing doesn't always stack up to in-person meetings and will also serve to spur new technologies designed to improve the virtual interaction experience. On the basis of existing fNIRS hyperscanning literature, we highlight the current gaps in research regarding virtual interactions. Furthermore, we provide insight into current hurdles regarding fNIRS hyperscanning hardware and methodology that should be addressed in order to shed light on this newly critical element of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Layer 2/3 Pyramidal Neurons of the Mouse Granular Retrosplenial Cortex and Their Innervation by Cortico-Cortical Axons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The retrosplenial cortex forms part of the cingulate cortex and is involved in memory and navigation. It is ventral region, the granular retrosplenial cortex, or GRSC is characterized by the presence, of small pyramidal neurons with a distinctive late-spiking (LS) firing pattern in layer 2/3. Using in vitro brain slices of the mouse GRSC we have studied the electrophysiological properties and synaptic responses of these LS neurons, comparing them with neighboring non-LS pyramidal neurons. LS and non-LS neurons showed different responses during cortical propagation of epileptiform discharges. All non-LS neurons generated large supra-threshold excitatory responses that generated bursts of action potentials. Contrastingly, the LS neurons showed small, and invariably subthreshold excitatory synaptic potentials. Although both types of pyramidal neurons were readily intermingled in the GRSC, we observed differences in their innervation by cortico-cortical axons. The application of glutamate to activate cortical neurons evoked synaptic responses in LS neurons only when applied at less than 250 μm, while in non-LS neurons we found synaptic responses when glutamate was applied at larger distances. Analysis of the synaptic responses evoked by long-range cortico-cortical axons (with the origin at 1200 μm from the recorded neurons or in the contralateral hemisphere) confirmed that non-LS neurons were strongly innervated by these axons, while they evoked only small responses or no response at all in the LS neurons (contralateral stimulation, non-LS: 194.0 ± 196.63 pA, n = 22; LS: 51.91 ± 35.26 pA, n = 10; p = 0.004). The excitatory/inhibitory balance was similar in both types of pyramidal neurons, but the latency of the EPSCs evoked by long-range cortico-cortical axons was longer in LS neurons (contralateral stimulation non-LS: 8.13 ± 1.23 ms, n = 17; LS: 10.76 ± 1.58 ms, n = 7; p = 0.004) suggesting a disynaptic mechanism. Our findings highlight the differential cortico-cortical axonal innervation of LS and non-LS pyramidal neurons, and that the two types of neurons are incorporated in different cortico-cortical neuronal circuits. This strongly suggests that the functional organization of the dorsal part of the GRSC is based on independent cortico-cortical circuits (among other elements).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Higher Sensitivity of GABAergic Compared to Glutamatergic Neurons to Growth-Promoting C3bot Treatment Is Mediated by Vimentin</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current study investigates the neurotrophic effects of Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (C3bot) on highly purified, glia-free, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Incubation with nanomolar concentrations of C3bot promotes dendrite formation as well as dendritic and axonal outgrowth in rat GABAergic neurons. A comparison of C3bot effects on sorted mouse GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons obtained from newly established NexCre;Ai9xVGAT Venus mice revealed a higher sensitivity of GABAergic cells to axonotrophic and dendritic effects of C3bot in terms of process length and branch formation. Protein biochemical analysis of known C3bot binding partners revealed comparable amounts of β1 integrin in both cell types but a higher expression of vimentin in GABAergic neurons. Accordingly, binding of C3bot to GABAergic neurons was stronger than binding to glutamatergic neurons. A combinatory treatment of glutamatergic neurons with C3bot and vimentin raised the amount of bound C3bot to levels comparable to the ones in GABAergic neurons, thereby confirming the specificity of effects. Overall, different surface vimentin levels between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exist that mediate neurotrophic C3bot effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-evoked miniature release of neurotransmitters is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in neural function and is implicated in synaptic plasticity, metaplasticity, and homeostasis. Spontaneous miniature release events (minis) are usually measured electrophysiologically by recording the miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) that they evoke. However, this indirect technique can be confounded by changes within the postsynaptic neuron. Here, using the fluorescent probe SynaptopHluorin 2×, we have developed an optical method for the measurement of minis that enables direct assessment of release events. We use the technique to reveal that the frequency of minis following incubation of hippocampal neurons with Amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) is increased. Electrophysiological mEPSC recordings obtained under the same conditions report a decrease in frequency, with the discrepancy likely due to Aβo-induced changes in quantal size. Optical quantal analysis of minis may therefore have a role in the study of minis in both normal physiology and disease, as it can circumvent potential confounds caused by postsynaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: More Sensitive Identification for Bradykinesia Compared to Tremors in Parkinson’s Disease Based on Parkinson’s KinetiGraph (PKG)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The effective management and therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) require appropriate clinical evaluation. The Parkinson’s KinetiGraph (PKG) is a wearable sensor system that can monitor the motion characteristics of PD objectively and continuously. This study was aimed to assess the correlations between PKG data and clinical scores of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and fluctuation. It also aims to explore the application value of identifying early motor symptoms. An observational study of 100 PD patients wearing the PKG for ≥ 6 days was performed. It provides a series of data, such as the bradykinesia score (BKS), percent time tremor (PTT), dyskinesia score (DKS), and fluctuation and dyskinesia score (FDS). PKG data and UPDRS scores were analyzed, including UPDRS III total scores, UPDRS III-bradykinesia scores (UPDRS III-B: items 23–26, 31), UPDRS III-rigidity scores (UPDRS III-R: item 22), and scores from the Wearing-off Questionnaire (WOQ-9). This study shows that there was significant correlation between BKS and UPDRS III scores, including UPDRS III total scores, UPDRS III-B, and UPDRS III-R scores (r = 0.479–0.588, p ≤ 0.001), especially in the early-stage group (r = 0.682, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Furthermore, we found that BKS in patients with left-sided onset (33.57 ± 5.14, n = 37) is more serious than in patients with right-sided onset (29.87 ± 6.86, n = 26). Our findings support the feasibility of using the PKG to detect abnormal movements, especially bradykinesia in PD. It is suitable for the early detection, remote monitoring, and timely treatment of PD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Machine Learning Classification Identifies Cerebellar Contributions to Early and Moderate Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia, marked by progressively degrading cognitive function. Although cerebellar changes occur throughout AD progression, its involvement and predictive contribution in its earliest stages, as well as gray or white matter components involved, remains unclear. We used MRI machine learning-based classification to assess the contribution of two tissue components [volume fraction myelin (VFM), and gray matter (GM) volume] within the whole brain, the neocortex, the whole cerebellum as well as its anterior and posterior parts and their predictive contribution to the first two stages of AD and typically aging controls. While classification accuracy increased with AD stages, VFM was the best predictor for all early stages of dementia when compared with typically aging controls. However, we document overall higher cerebellar prediction accuracy when compared to the whole brain with distinct structural signatures of higher anterior cerebellar contribution to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and higher posterior cerebellar contribution to mild/moderate stages of AD for each tissue property. Based on these different cerebellar profiles and their unique contribution to early disease stages, we propose a refined model of cerebellar contribution to early AD development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61413</link>
	<description>Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a rare neurovascular disease that is characterized by enlarged and irregular blood vessels that often lead to cerebral hemorrhage. Loss-of-function mutations to any of three genes results in CCM lesion formation; namely, &lt;i&gt;KRIT1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CCM2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PDCD10 (CCM3)&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report for the first time in-depth single-cell RNA sequencing, combined with spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry, to comprehensively characterize subclasses of brain endothelial cells (ECs) under both normal conditions and after deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pdcd10&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ccm3)&lt;/i&gt; in a mouse model of CCM. Integrated single-cell analysis identifies arterial ECs as refractory to CCM transformation. Conversely, a subset of angiogenic venous capillary ECs and respective resident endothelial progenitors appear to be at the origin of CCM lesions. These data are relevant for the understanding of the plasticity of the brain vascular system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis of CCM disease at the single cell level.</description>

	<title>eLife: Atg43 tethers isolation membranes to mitochondria to promote starvation-induced mitophagy in fission yeast</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61245</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61245</link>
	<description>Degradation of mitochondria through mitophagy contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial function. In this study, we identified that Atg43, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, serves as a mitophagy receptor in the model organism &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; to promote the selective degradation of mitochondria. Atg43 contains an Atg8-family-interacting motif essential for mitophagy. Forced recruitment of Atg8 to mitochondria restores mitophagy in Atg43-deficient cells, suggesting that Atg43 tethers expanding isolation membranes to mitochondria. We found that the mitochondrial import factors, including the Mim1–Mim2 complex and Tom70, are crucial for mitophagy. Artificial mitochondrial loading of Atg43 bypasses the requirement of the import factors, suggesting that they contribute to mitophagy through Atg43. Atg43 not only maintains growth ability during starvation but also facilitates vegetative growth through its mitophagy-independent function. Thus, Atg43 is a useful model to study the mechanism and physiological roles, as well as the origin and evolution, of mitophagy in eukaryotes.</description>

	<title>eLife: Asymmetric neurogenic commitment of retinal progenitors involves Notch through the endocytic pathway</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60462</link>
	<description>During brain development, progenitor cells need to balance proliferation and differentiation in order to generate different neurons in the correct numbers and proportions. Currently, the patterns of multipotent progenitor divisions that lead to neurogenic entry and the factors that regulate them are not fully understood. We here use the zebrafish retina to address this gap, exploiting its suitability for quantitative live-imaging. We show that early neurogenic progenitors arise from asymmetric divisions. Notch regulates this asymmetry, as when inhibited, symmetric divisions producing two neurogenic progenitors occur. Surprisingly however, Notch does not act through an apicobasal activity gradient as previously suggested, but through asymmetric inheritance of Sara-positive endosomes. Further, the resulting neurogenic progenitors show cell biological features different from multipotent progenitors, raising the possibility that an intermediate progenitor state exists in the retina. Our study thus reveals new insights into the regulation of proliferative and differentiative events during central nervous system development.</description>

	<description>Single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is an adaptable method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. The development of high throughput methodologies and the growth of commercial instrumentation have outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, and automated methodologies to objectively analyze the wealth of produced data. Here we present DeepFRET, an automated, open-source standalone solution based on deep learning, where the only crucial human intervention in transiting from raw microscope images to histograms of biomolecule behavior, is a user-adjustable quality threshold. Integrating standard features of smFRET analysis, DeepFRET consequently outputs the common kinetic information metrics. Its classification accuracy on ground truth data reached &amp;gt;95% outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold, only requiring ~1% of the time. Its precise and rapid operation on real data demonstrates DeepFRET’s capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics and the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for dynamic structural biology.</description>

	<title>eLife: Formicine ants swallow their highly acidic poison for gut microbial selection and control</title>

	<description>Animals continuously encounter microorganisms that are essential for health or cause disease. They are thus challenged to control harmful microbes while allowing the acquisition of beneficial microbes. This challenge is likely especially important for social insects with respect to microbes in food, as they often store food and exchange food among colony members. Here we show that formicine ants actively swallow their antimicrobial, highly acidic poison gland secretion. The ensuing acidic environment in the stomach, the crop, can limit the establishment of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes ingested with food and improve the survival of ants when faced with pathogen contaminated food. At the same time, crop acidity selectively allows acquisition and colonization by Acetobacteraceae, known bacterial gut associates of formicine ants. This suggests that swallowing of the poison in formicine ants acts as a microbial filter and that antimicrobials have a potentially widespread but so far underappreciated dual role in host-microbe interactions.</description>

	<description>The placenta is the interface between mother and fetus in all eutherian species. However, our understanding of this essential organ remains incomplete. A substantial challenge has been the syncytial cells of the placenta, which have made dissociation and independent evaluation of the different cell types of this organ difficult. Here, we address questions concerning the ontogeny, specification, and function of the cell types of a representative hemochorial placenta by performing single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) at multiple stages of mouse embryonic development focusing on the exchange interface, the labyrinth. Timepoints extended from progenitor driven expansion through terminal differentiation. Analysis by snRNA-seq identified transcript profiles and inferred functions, cell trajectories, signaling interactions, and transcriptional drivers of all but the most highly polyploid cell types of the placenta. These data profile placental development at an unprecedented resolution, provide insights into differentiation and function across time, and provide a resource for future study.</description>

	<description>Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, but the precise pathological mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis often remain to be elucidated. In recent years, condensates formed by phase separation have emerged as a new principle governing the organization and functional regulation of cells. Increasing evidence links cancer-related mutations to aberrantly altered condensate assembly, suggesting that condensates play a key role in tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize and discuss the latest progress on the formation, regulation, and function of condensates. Special emphasis is given to emerging evidence regarding the link between condensates and the initiation and progression of cancers.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59853</link>
	<description>For decades, numerous researchers have documented the presence of the fruit fly or &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; on alcohol-containing food sources. Although fruit flies are a common laboratory model organism of choice, there is relatively little understood about the ethological relationship between flies and ethanol. In this study, we find that when male flies inhabit ethanol-containing food substrates they become more aggressive. We identify a possible mechanism for this behavior. The odor of ethanol potentiates the activity of sensory neurons in response to an aggression-promoting pheromone. Finally, we observed that the odor of ethanol also promotes attraction to a food-related citrus odor. Understanding how flies interact with the complex natural environment they inhabit can provide valuable insight into how different natural stimuli are integrated to promote fundamental behaviors.</description>

	<description>Spatial navigation requires landmark coding from two perspectives, relying on viewpoint-invariant and self-referenced representations. The brain encodes information within each reference frame but their interactions and functional dependency remains unclear. Here we investigate the relationship between neurons in the rat's retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and entorhinal cortex (MEC) that increase firing near boundaries of space. Border cells in RSC specifically encode walls, but not objects, and are sensitive to the animal’s direction to nearby borders. These egocentric representations are generated independent of visual or whisker sensation but are affected by inputs from MEC that contains allocentric spatial cells. Pharmaco- and optogenetic inhibition of MEC led to a disruption of border coding in RSC, but not vice versa, indicating allocentric-to-egocentric transformation. Finally, RSC border cells fire prospective to the animal’s next motion, unlike those in MEC, revealing the MEC-RSC pathway as an extended border coding circuit that implements coordinate transformation to guide navigation behavior.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58942</link>
	<description>Aggressive social interactions are used to compete for limited resources and are regulated by complex sensory cues and the organism's internal state. While both sexes exhibit aggression, its neuronal underpinnings are understudied in females. Here, we identify a population of sexually dimorphic aIPg neurons in the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;central brain whose optogenetic activation increased, and genetic inactivation reduced, female aggression. Analysis of GAL4 lines identified in an unbiased screen for increased female chasing behavior revealed the involvement of another sexually dimorphic neuron, pC1d, and implicated aIPg and pC1d neurons as core nodes regulating female aggression. Connectomic analysis demonstrated that aIPg neurons and pC1d are interconnected and suggest that aIPg neurons may exert part of their effect by gating the flow of visual information to descending neurons. Our work reveals important regulatory components of the neuronal circuitry that underlies female aggressive social interactions and provides tools for their manipulation.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58020</link>
	<description>Human cells lacking RIF1 are highly sensitive to replication inhibitors, but the reasons for this sensitivity have been enigmatic. Here we show that RIF1 must be present both during replication stress and in the ensuing recovery period to promote cell survival. Of two isoforms produced by alternative splicing, we find that RIF1-Long alone can protect cells against replication inhibition, but RIF1-Short is incapable of mediating protection. Consistent with this isoform-specific role, RIF1-Long is required to promote the formation of the 53BP1 nuclear bodies that protect unrepaired damage sites in the G1 phase following replication stress. Overall, our observations show that RIF1 is needed at several cell cycle stages after replication insult, with the RIF1-Long isoform playing a specific role during the ensuing G1 phase in damage site protection.</description>

	<title>eLife: Walking Drosophila navigate complex plumes using stochastic decisions biased by the timing of odor encounters</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57524</link>
	<description>How insects navigate complex odor plumes, where the location and timing of odor packets are uncertain, remains unclear. Here we imaged complex odor plumes simultaneously with freely-walking flies, quantifying how behavior is shaped by encounters with individual odor packets. We found that navigation was stochastic and did not rely on the continuous modulation of speed or orientation. Instead, flies turned stochastically with stereotyped saccades, whose direction was biased upwind by the timing of prior odor encounters, while the magnitude and rate of saccades remained constant. Further, flies used the timing of odor encounters to modulate the transition rates between walks and stops. In more regular environments, flies continuously modulate speed and orientation, even though encounters can still occur randomly due to animal motion. We find that in less predictable environments, where encounters are random in both space and time, walking flies navigate with random walks biased by encounter timing.</description>

Many common medical conditions (such as cancer, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and others) are associated with inflammation, and even more so when combined with the effects of ageing and multimorbidity. While the inflammatory response varies in different tissue types, under disease and in response to therapeutic interventions, it has common interactions that occur between immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Understanding these underlying inflammatory mechanisms is key in progressing treatments and therapies for numerous inflammatory conditions. It is now considered that constituent mechanisms of the inflammatory response can be actively manipulated in order to drive resolution of inflammatory damage; particularly, those mechanisms related to the pro-inflammatory role of neutrophils and the anti-inflammatory role of macrophages. In this article, we describe the assembly of a hybrid mathematical model in which the spatial spread of inflammatory mediators is described through partial differential equations, and immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) are described individually via an agent-based modelling approach. We pay close attention to how immune cells chemotax toward pro-inflammatory mediators, presenting a model for cell chemotaxis that is calibrated against experimentally observed cell trajectories in healthy and COPD-affected scenarios. We illustrate how variations in key model parameters can drive the switch from resolution of inflammation to chronic outcomes, and show that aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis can move an otherwise healthy outcome to one of chronicity. Finally, we reflect on our results in the context of the on-going hunt for new therapeutic interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/53zyQmYx9RA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (&lt;i&gt;CYP2D6&lt;/i&gt;) is a highly polymorphic gene whose protein product metabolizes more than 20% of clinically used drugs. Genetic variations in &lt;i&gt;CYP2D6&lt;/i&gt; are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making &lt;i&gt;CYP2D6&lt;/i&gt; one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to &lt;i&gt;CYP2D6&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of &lt;i&gt;CYP2D6&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts &lt;i&gt;CYP2D6&lt;/i&gt; haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Luls_obX_7o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Macroorganisms are inhabited by microbial communities that often change through the lifespan of an individual. One of the factors contributing to this change is colonization from the environment. The colonization of initially microbe-free hosts is particularly interesting, as their microbiome depends entirely on microbes of external origin. We present a mathematical model of this process with a particular emphasis on the effect of ecological drift and a finite host lifespan. Our results indicate the host lifespan becomes especially relevant for short-living organisms (e.g. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;). In this case, alternative microbiome states (often called enterotypes), the coexistence of microbe-free and colonized hosts, and a reduced probability of colonization can be observed in our model. These results unify multiple reported observations around colonization and suggest that no selective or deterministic drivers are necessary to explain them.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tutDqAxOPYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mathematical modelling has successfully been used to provide quantitative descriptions of many viral infections, but for the Ebola virus, which requires biosafety level 4 facilities for experimentation, modelling can play a crucial role. Ebola modelling efforts have primarily focused on &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; virus kinetics, e.g., in animal models, to aid the development of antivirals and vaccines. But, thus far, these studies have not yielded a detailed specification of the infection cycle, which could provide a foundational description of the virus kinetics and thus a deeper understanding of their clinical manifestation. Here, we obtain a diverse experimental data set of the Ebola infection &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and then make use of Bayesian inference methods to fully identify parameters in a mathematical model of the infection. Our results provide insights into the distribution of time an infected cell spends in the eclipse phase (the period between infection and the start of virus production), as well as the rate at which infectious virions lose infectivity. We suggest how these results can be used in future models to describe co-infection with defective interfering particles, which are an emerging alternative therapeutic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u_zXlulEMdw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created synthetic datasets based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Finally, we applied the proposed method to mouse developmental enhancers and were able to identify the components of a known heterotypic TF cluster. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar depends on the nature of the prediction task.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-1BE1zUKgWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Leveraging functional annotation to identify genes associated with complex diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008315</guid>

To increase statistical power to identify genes associated with complex traits, a number of transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods have been proposed using gene expression as a mediating trait linking genetic variations and diseases. These methods first predict expression levels based on inferred expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and then identify expression-mediated genetic effects on diseases by associating phenotypes with predicted expression levels. The success of these methods critically depends on the identification of eQTLs, which may not be functional in the corresponding tissue, due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the correlation of gene expression between tissues. Here, we introduce a new method called T-GEN (Transcriptome-mediated identification of disease-associated Genes with Epigenetic aNnotation) to identify disease-associated genes leveraging epigenetic information. Through prioritizing SNPs with tissue-specific epigenetic annotation, T-GEN can better identify SNPs that are both statistically predictive and biologically functional. We found that a significantly higher percentage (an increase of 18.7% to 47.2%) of eQTLs identified by T-GEN are inferred to be functional by ChromHMM and more are deleterious based on their Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores. Applying T-GEN to 207 complex traits, we were able to identify more trait-associated genes (ranging from 7.7% to 102%) than those from existing methods. Among the identified genes associated with these traits, T-GEN can better identify genes with high (&amp;gt;0.99) pLI scores compared to other methods. When T-GEN was applied to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, we identified 96 genes located at 15 loci, including two novel loci not implicated in previous GWAS. We further replicated 50 genes in an independent GWAS, including one of the two novel loci.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AzRN6SQGfzs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the modern genomic era, scientists without extensive bioinformatic training need to apply high-power computational analyses to critical tasks like phage genome annotation. At the Center for Phage Technology (CPT), we developed a suite of phage-oriented tools housed in open, user-friendly web-based interfaces. A Galaxy platform conducts computationally intensive analyses and Apollo, a collaborative genome annotation editor, visualizes the results of these analyses. The collection includes open source applications such as the BLAST+ suite, InterProScan, and several gene callers, as well as unique tools developed at the CPT that allow maximum user flexibility. We describe in detail programs for finding Shine-Dalgarno sequences, resources used for confident identification of lysis genes such as spanins, and methods used for identifying interrupted genes that contain frameshifts or introns. At the CPT, genome annotation is separated into two robust segments that are facilitated through the automated execution of many tools chained together in an operation called a workflow. First, the structural annotation workflow results in gene and other feature calls. This is followed by a functional annotation workflow that combines sequence comparisons and conserved domain searching, which is contextualized to allow integrated evidence assessment in functional prediction. Finally, we describe a workflow used for comparative genomics. Using this multi-purpose platform enables researchers to easily and accurately annotate an entire phage genome. The portal can be accessed at https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub with accompanying user training material.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mpr76wZdT10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Each year in the United States, influenza causes illness in 9.2 to 35.6 million individuals and is responsible for 12,000 to 56,000 deaths. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks influenza activity through a national surveillance network. These data are only available after a delay of 1 to 2 weeks, and thus influenza epidemiologists and transmission modelers have explored the use of other data sources to produce more timely estimates and predictions of influenza activity. We evaluated whether data collected from a national commercial network of influenza diagnostic machines could produce valid estimates of the current burden and help to predict influenza trends in the United States. Quidel Corporation provided us with de-identified influenza test results transmitted in real-time from a national network of influenza test machines called the Influenza Test System (ITS). We used this ITS dataset to estimate and predict influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the United States over the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons. First, we developed linear logistic models on national and regional geographic scales that accurately estimated two CDC influenza metrics: the proportion of influenza test results that are positive and the proportion of physician visits that are ILI-related. We then used our estimated ILI-related proportion of physician visits in transmission models to produce improved predictions of influenza trends in the United States at both the regional and national scale. These findings suggest that ITS can be leveraged to improve “nowcasts” and short-term forecasts of U.S. influenza activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QaDw8lxKTVM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

For any given bacteriophage genome or phage-derived sequences in metagenomic data sets, we are unable to assign a function to 50–90% of genes, or more. Structural protein-encoding genes constitute a large fraction of the average phage genome and are among the most divergent and difficult-to-identify genes using homology-based methods. To understand the functions encoded by phages, their contributions to their environments, and to help gauge their utility as potential phage therapy agents, we have developed a new approach to classify phage ORFs into ten major classes of structural proteins or into an “other” category. The resulting tool is named PhANNs (Phage Artificial Neural Networks). We built a database of 538,213 manually curated phage protein sequences that we split into eleven subsets (10 for cross-validation, one for testing) using a novel clustering method that ensures there are no homologous proteins between sets yet maintains the maximum sequence diversity for training. An Artificial Neural Network ensemble trained on features extracted from those sets reached a test F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-score of 0.875 and test accuracy of 86.2%. PhANNs can rapidly classify proteins into one of the ten structural classes or, if not predicted to fall in one of the ten classes, as “other,” providing a new approach for functional annotation of phage proteins. PhANNs is open source and can be run from our web server or installed locally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yy6oxyk6vd8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using mRNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly, we identified, cloned, and characterized 9 previously undiscovered fluorescent protein (FP) homologs from &lt;i&gt;Aequorea victoria&lt;/i&gt; and a related &lt;i&gt;Aequorea&lt;/i&gt; species, with most sequences highly divergent from &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;victoria&lt;/i&gt; green fluorescent protein (avGFP). Among these FPs are the brightest green fluorescent protein (GFP) homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, &lt;i&gt;Aequorea&lt;/i&gt; species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including 2 that are photoconvertible. X-ray crystallography revealed that &lt;i&gt;Aequorea&lt;/i&gt; CPs contain a chemically novel chromophore with an unexpected crosslink to the main polypeptide chain. Because of the unique attributes of several of these newly discovered FPs, we expect that &lt;i&gt;Aequorea&lt;/i&gt; will, once again, give rise to an entirely new generation of useful probes for bioimaging and biosensing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8dUh_jGbLL4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

U2 Small Nuclear RNA Auxiliary Factor 1 (U2AF1) forms a heterodimeric complex with U2AF2 that is primarily responsible for 3ʹ splice site selection. U2AF1 mutations have been identified in most cancers but are prevalent in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and the most common mutation is a missense substitution of serine-34 to phenylalanine (S34F). The U2AF heterodimer also has a noncanonical function as a translational regulator. Here, we report that the U2AF1-S34F mutation results in specific misregulation of the translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis machinery. The net result is an increase in mRNA translation at the single-cell level. Among the translationally up-regulated targets of U2AF1-S34F is Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), which is a major driver of myeloid malignancy. Depletion of NPM1 impairs the viability of the U2AF1-S34F mutant cells and causes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing defects, thus indicating an unanticipated synthetic interaction between U2AF1, NPM1, and ribosome biogenesis. Our results establish a unique molecular phenotype for the U2AF1 mutation that recapitulates translational misregulation in myeloid disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4lfV0dZva7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The steroid hormone progesterone (P4) mediates many physiological processes through either nuclear receptors that modulate gene expression or membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) that mediate nongenomic signaling. mPR signaling remains poorly understood. Here we show that the topology of mPRβ is similar to adiponectin receptors and opposite to that of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocyte meiosis as a well-established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we demonstrate that mPRβ signaling requires the adaptor protein APPL1 and the kinase Akt2. We further show that P4 induces clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPRβ into signaling endosome, where mPR interacts transiently with APPL1 and Akt2 to induce meiosis. Our findings outline the early steps involved in mPR signaling and expand the spectrum of mPR signaling through the multitude of pathways involving APPL1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LdVaav2-THo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A crucial aspect when learning a language is discovering the rules that govern how words are combined in order to convey meanings. Because rules are characterized by sequential co-occurrences between elements (e.g., “&lt;i&gt;These&lt;/i&gt; cupcake&lt;i&gt;s are un&lt;/i&gt;believ&lt;i&gt;able&lt;/i&gt;”), tracking the statistical relationships between these elements is fundamental. However, purely bottom-up statistical learning alone cannot fully account for the ability to create abstract rule representations that can be generalized, a paramount requirement of linguistic rules. Here, we provide evidence that, after the statistical relations between words have been extracted, the engagement of goal-directed attention is key to enable rule generalization. Incidental learning performance during a rule-learning task on an artificial language revealed a progressive shift from statistical learning to goal-directed attention. In addition, and consistent with the recruitment of attention, functional MRI (fMRI) analyses of late learning stages showed left parietal activity within a broad bilateral dorsal frontoparietal network. Critically, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on participants’ peak of activation within the left parietal cortex impaired their ability to generalize learned rules to a structurally analogous new language. No stimulation or rTMS on a nonrelevant brain region did not have the same interfering effect on generalization. Performance on an additional attentional task showed that this rTMS on the parietal site hindered participants’ ability to integrate “what” (stimulus identity) and “when” (stimulus timing) information about an expected target. The present findings suggest that learning rules from speech is a two-stage process: following statistical learning, goal-directed attention—involving left parietal regions—integrates “what” and “when” stimulus information to facilitate rapid rule generalization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EdTXW6PtEL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Many, but not all, lineage-specific genes can be explained by homology detection failure</title>

Genes for which homologs can be detected only in a limited group of evolutionarily related species, called “lineage-specific genes,” are pervasive: Essentially every lineage has them, and they often comprise a sizable fraction of the group’s total genes. Lineage-specific genes are often interpreted as “novel” genes, representing genetic novelty born anew within that lineage. Here, we develop a simple method to test an alternative null hypothesis: that lineage-specific genes do have homologs outside of the lineage that, even while evolving at a constant rate in a novelty-free manner, have merely become undetectable by search algorithms used to infer homology. We show that this null hypothesis is sufficient to explain the lack of detected homologs of a large number of lineage-specific genes in fungi and insects. However, we also find that a minority of lineage-specific genes in both clades are not well explained by this novelty-free model. The method provides a simple way of identifying which lineage-specific genes call for special explanations beyond homology detection failure, highlighting them as interesting candidates for further study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/m1Tk0DF4EGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Vision adaptation in the laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis, Linnaeus, 1766) inferred from structural, ultrastructural, and genetic characterization</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Vision adaptation in the laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis, Linnaeus, 1766) inferred from structural, ultrastructural, and genetic characterization&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d63d5b89-c9dd-4abf-8253-49d54a3865a8/cne25059-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We characterized the under‐explored retina of the laughing dove, &lt;i&gt;Streptopelia senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to light and electron microscopy, we sequenced the short wavelength sensitive opsin SWS1. Using phylogeny and multiple sequence alignment, we found that the SWS1 is a violet sensitive opsin. Our results showed the presence of retinal pigmented epithelium that has plentiful melanosomes. There were various oil droplets, cones, horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, and Müller cells. Oligodendrocytes myelinated the nerve fiber layer. Overall, our data suggest a link between the structural variation and the photic adaptation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroanatomy of the retina reflects adaptation and acclimation for dark and light conditions. Retinal cells and genes must be functionally adjusted to various environmental luminosities. Opsins are brilliant molecules to assess the adaptations at the genetic and phenotypic levels. Photic adaptations may reveal new mechanisms that enhance vision abilities. Through the investigation of histological, ultrastructural constituents of the whole retinal layers, and the sequencing of shortwave length sensitive opsin 1 (SWS1) of the laughing dove (&lt;i&gt;Streptopelia senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;), the current study confirms the plasticity of the retina in response to the natural photic conditions. Retinal pigmented epithelium has plentiful melanosomes, signifying a highly adapted eye for maximum light perception and protection. Variously colored oil droplets signify high color vision ability. Stratified outer nuclear layer with many Müller cells suggests high sensitivity to dim conditions and high retinal regeneration. The penetration of outer limiting membrane by photoreceptor nuclei and Müller cell microvilli could minimize the light reflection. Oligodendrocytes establish thick myelination demanded for a keen visual acuity. A functional violet sensitive SWS1 with crucial Ser90 is presumed. Molecular phylogeny showed a secondary loss as color vision was shifted back from ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity to the ancestral avian violet sensitivity, thus improving visual resolution. However, SWS1 has some UV sensitive residues. These findings implicate not only spectral adaptations with high color vision ability and acuity but also photoinduced structural reorganizations. Further studies are needed to assess the secrets between photons and the structural genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of Retinal Ganglion Cell Types and Brain Nuclei expressing the transcription factor Brn3c/Pou4f3 using a Cre recombinase knock‐in allele&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2f88a4aa-6642-4eac-a257-2fff44e30143/cne25065-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left ‐ Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC) innervate the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN), known to be involved in cortical feedback to the relay thalamic nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right ‐ Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Brn3b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs cluster in an area of increased RGC density akin to an area centralis subtending the binocular field of the mouse.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell types (RGCs), the main transducers of visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock‐in reporter allele expressing Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Brn3c positive (Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination and use it to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus response properties of Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGC types. Furthermore, we explore brain nuclei that express Brn3c or receive input from Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. Most RGCs expressing Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Genetic Brn3c‐Brn3b intersection reveals an area of increased RGC density, extending from dorso‐temporal to ventro‐lateral across the retina and overlapping with the mouse binocular field of view. In addition we report a Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGC projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a visual nucleus that was not previously shown to receive retinal input. Furthermore, Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons highlight a previously unknown subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe). Thus, our newly generated allele provides novel biological insights into RGC type classification, brain connectivity and cytoarchitectonic.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developing high-performing predictive models for large tabular data sets is a
challenging task. The state-of-the-art methods are based on expert-developed
model ensembles from different supervised learning methods. Recently, automated
machine learning (AutoML) is emerging as a promising approach to automate
predictive model development. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an AutoML
approach that generates and evaluates multiple neural network architectures
concurrently and improves the accuracy of the generated models iteratively. A
key issue in NAS, particularly for large data sets, is the large computation
time required to evaluate each generated architecture. While data-parallel
training is a promising approach that can address this issue, its use within
NAS is difficult. For different data sets, the data-parallel training settings
such as the number of parallel processes, learning rate, and batch size need to
be adapted to achieve high accuracy and reduction in training time. To that
end, we have developed AgEBO-Tabular, an approach to combine aging evolution
(AgE), a parallel NAS method that searches over neural architecture space, and
an asynchronous Bayesian optimization method for tuning the hyperparameters of
the data-parallel training simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method to generate high-performing neural network models for large
tabular benchmark data sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the automatically
discovered neural network models using our method outperform the
state-of-the-art AutoML ensemble models in inference speed by two orders of
magnitude while reaching similar accuracy values.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In today's clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely
accelerated through subsampling of the associated Fourier domain. Currently,
the construction of these subsampling strategies - known as experimental design
- relies primarily on heuristics. We propose to learn experimental design
strategies for accelerated MRI with policy gradient methods. Unexpectedly, our
experiments show that a simple greedy approximation of the objective leads to
solutions nearly on-par with the more general non-greedy approach. We offer a
partial explanation for this phenomenon rooted in greater variance in the
non-greedy objective's gradient estimates, and experimentally verify that this
variance hampers non-greedy models in adapting their policies to individual MR
images. We empirically show that this adaptivity is key to improving
subsampling designs.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Fusion-Catalyzed Pruning for Optimizing Deep Learning on Intelligent Edge Devices. (arXiv:2010.16165v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing computational cost of deep neural network models limits the
applicability of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices.
While a number of neural network pruning methods have been proposed to compress
the models, prevailing approaches focus only on parametric operators (e.g.,
convolution), which may miss optimization opportunities. In this paper, we
present a novel fusion-catalyzed pruning approach, called FuPruner, which
simultaneously optimizes the parametric and non-parametric operators for
accelerating neural networks. We introduce an aggressive fusion method to
equivalently transform a model, which extends the optimization space of pruning
and enables non-parametric operators to be pruned in a similar manner as
parametric operators, and a dynamic filter pruning method is applied to
decrease the computational cost of models while retaining the accuracy
requirement. Moreover, FuPruner provides configurable optimization options for
controlling fusion and pruning, allowing much more flexible
performance-accuracy trade-offs to be made. Evaluation with state-of-the-art
residual neural networks on five representative intelligent edge platforms,
Jetson TX2, Jetson Nano, Edge TPU, NCS, and NCS2, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach, which can accelerate the inference of models on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16124</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent experiments have shown that the spontaneous activity of young
dissociated neuronal cultures can be described as a process of highly
inhomogeneous nucleation and front propagation due to the localization of noise
activity, i.e., noise focusing. However, the basic understanding of the
mechanisms of noise build-up leading to the nucleation remain an open
fundamental problem. Here we present a minimal dynamical model called
stochastic quorum percolation that can account for the observed phenomena,
while providing a robust theoretical framework. The model reproduces the first
and second order phase--transitions of bursting dynamics and neuronal
avalanches respectively, and captures the profound effect metric correlations
in the network topology can have on the dynamics. The application of our
results to other systems such as in the propagation of infectious diseases and
of rumors is discussed.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Unsupervised One-shot Learning of Both Specific Instances and Generalised Classes with a Hippocampal Architecture. (arXiv:2010.15999v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15999</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15999</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Established experimental procedures for one-shot machine learning do not test
the ability to learn or remember specific instances of classes, a key feature
of animal intelligence. Distinguishing specific instances is necessary for many
real-world tasks, such as remembering which cup belongs to you. Generalisation
within classes conflicts with the ability to separate instances of classes,
making it difficult to achieve both capabilities within a single architecture.
We propose an extension to the standard Omniglot classification-generalisation
framework that additionally tests the ability to distinguish specific instances
after one exposure and introduces noise and occlusion corruption. Learning is
defined as an ability to classify as well as recall training samples.
Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) is a popular model of mammalian brain
regions believed to play a crucial role in learning from a single exposure to a
stimulus. We created an artificial neural network implementation of CLS and
applied it to the extended Omniglot benchmark. Our unsupervised model
demonstrates comparable performance to existing supervised ANNs on the Omniglot
classification task (requiring generalisation), without the need for
domain-specific inductive biases. On the extended Omniglot instance-recognition
task, the same model also demonstrates significantly better performance than a
baseline nearest-neighbour approach, given partial occlusion and noise.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dendritic Voltage Recordings Explain Paradoxical Synaptic Plasticity: A Modeling Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.585539</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.585539</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experiments have shown that the same stimulation pattern that causes Long-Term Potentiation in proximal synapses, will induce Long-Term Depression in distal ones. In order to understand these, and other, surprising observations we use a phenomenological model of Hebbian plasticity at the location of the synapse. Our model describes the Hebbian condition of joint activity of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in a compact form as the interaction of the glutamate trace left by a presynaptic spike with the time course of the postsynaptic voltage. Instead of simulating the voltage, we test the model using experimentally recorded dendritic voltage traces in hippocampus and neocortex. We find that the time course of the voltage in the neighborhood of a stimulated synapse is a reliable predictor of whether a stimulated synapse undergoes potentiation, depression, or no change. Our computational model can explain the existence of different -at first glance seemingly paradoxical- outcomes of synaptic potentiation and depression experiments depending on the dendritic location of the synapse and the frequency or timing of the stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Interplay Between Beta-Amyloid 1–42 (Aβ1–42)-Induced Hippocampal Inflammatory Response, p-tau, Vascular Pathology, and Their Synergistic Contributions to Neuronal Death and Behavioral Deficits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common chronic neurodegenerative disorder, has complex neuropathology. The principal neuropathological hallmarks of the disease are the deposition of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein. These changes occur with neuroinflammation, a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neuronal synaptic dysfunction, all of which ultimately lead to neuronal cell loss and cognitive deficits in AD. Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; was stereotaxically administered bilaterally into the CA1 region of the hippocampi of 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. This study aimed to characterize, utilizing immunohistochemistry and behavioral testing, the spatial and temporal effects of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; on a broad set of parameters characteristic of AD: p-tau, neuroinflammation, vascular pathology, pyramidal cell survival, and behavior. Three days after Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; injection and before significant neuronal cell loss was detected, acute neuroinflammatory and vascular responses were observed. These responses included the up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also known as CD31), fibrinogen labeling, and an increased number of activated astrocytes and microglia in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. From day 7, there was significant pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and by 30 days, significant localized up-regulation of p-tau, GFAP, Iba-1, CD31, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-injected mice compared with controls. These molecular changes in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-injected mice were accompanied by cognitive deterioration, as demonstrated by long-term spatial memory impairment. This study is reporting a comprehensive examination of a complex set of parameters associated with intrahippocampal administration of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in mice, their spatiotemporal interactions and combined contribution to the disease progression. We show that a single Aβ injection can reproduce aspects of the inflammatory, vascular, and p-tau induced pathology occurring in the AD human brain that lead to cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Nanobody-Based Probes for Subcellular Protein Identification and Visualization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how building blocks of life contribute to physiology is greatly aided by protein identification and cellular localization. The two main labeling approaches developed over the past decades are labeling with antibodies such as immunoglobulin G (IgGs) or use of genetically encoded tags such as fluorescent proteins. However, IgGs are large proteins (150 kDa), which limits penetration depth and uncertainty of target position caused by up to ∼25 nm distance of the label created by the chosen targeting approach. Additionally, IgGs cannot be easily recombinantly modulated and engineered as part of fusion proteins because they consist of multiple independent translated chains. In the last decade single domain antigen binding proteins are being explored in bioscience as a tool in revealing molecular identity and localization to overcome limitations by IgGs. These nanobodies have several potential benefits over routine applications. Because of their small size (15 kDa), nanobodies better penetrate during labeling procedures and improve resolution. Moreover, nanobodies cDNA can easily be fused with other cDNA. Multidomain proteins can thus be easily engineered consisting of domains for targeting (nanobodies) and visualization by fluorescence microscopy (fluorescent proteins) or electron microscopy (based on certain enzymes). Additional modules for e.g., purification are also easily added. These nanobody-based probes can be applied in cells for live-cell endogenous protein detection or may be purified prior to use on molecules, cells or tissues. Here, we present the current state of nanobody-based probes and their implementation in microscopy, including pitfalls and potential future opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Interaction of Age and Self-reported Physical Sports Activity on White Matter Hyperintensity Volume in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.576025</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral white matter (WM) lesion load, as measured by white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been associated with increasing age and cardiovascular risk factors, like hypertension. Physical sports activity (PSA) may play an important role in maintaining WM in the context of healthy aging. In 196 healthy older adults, we investigated whether participants reporting high levels of PSA (n = 36) had reduced total and regional WMH volumes compared to those reporting low levels of PSA (n = 160). Age group [young-old (YO) = 50–69 years; old-old (OO) = 70–89 years], PSA group, and age by PSA group interaction effects were tested, with sex, hypertension, and body mass index (BMI) as covariates. We found significant main effects for age group and age by PSA group interactions for total, frontal, temporal, and parietal WMH volumes. There were no main effects of PSA group on WMH volumes. The OO group with low PSA had greater total, frontal, temporal, and parietal WMH volumes than the YO with low PSA and OO with high PSA groups. WMH volumes for the YO and OO groups with high PSA were comparable. These findings indicate an age group difference in those with low PSA, with greater WMH volumes in older adults, which was not observed in those with high PSA. The results suggest that engaging in high levels of PSA may be an important lifestyle factor that can help to diminish WMH lesion load in old age, potentially reducing the impact of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;OFF bipolar cell density varies by subtype, eccentricity and along the dorsal ventral axis in the mouse retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1efb1941-23ff-4010-92f9-aacb9f4302ae/cne25064-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Density of OFF bipolar cells vary by subtype, eccentricity and along the dorsal ventral axis. (a) Retinas were disected into four quadrants labeled with short‐wave opsin to determine orientation. (b) Cells were marked and saved as series of individual coordinates which underwent Voronoi tessellation to analyze spatial heterogeneity. (c) Volumetric datasets were counted do determine cell count. (d) OFF‐bipolar cell density contour maps by subtype 1a, 1b, 2, 3a, 3b, 4.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural retina is organized along central‐peripheral, dorsal‐ventral and laminar planes. Cellular density and distributions vary along the central‐peripheral and dorsal‐ventral axis in species including primates, mice, fish and birds. Differential distribution of cell types within the retina is associated with sensitivity to different types of damage that underpin major retinal diseases, including macular degeneration and glaucoma. Normal variation in retinal distribution remains unreported for multiple cell types in widely used research models, including mouse. Here we map the distribution of all known OFF bipolar cell (BC) populations and horizontal cells. We report significant variation in the distribution of OFF BC populations and horizontal cells along the dorsal‐ventral and central‐peripheral axes of the retina. Distribution patterns are much more pronounced for some populations of OFF BC cells than others and may correspond to the cell type's specialized functions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Scalp Ripples Can Predict Development of Epilepsy After First Unprovoked Seizure in Childhood</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of children at risk of developing epilepsy after a first unprovoked seizure can be challenging. Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with higher risk but have limited sensitivity and specificity. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are newer biomarkers for epileptogenesis. We prospectively evaluated the predictive value of HFOs for developing epilepsy in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) of children after a first unprovoked seizure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their first seizure, 56 children were followed prospectively over 12 months and then grouped in “epilepsy” or “no epilepsy.” Initial EEGs were visually analyzed for spikes, spike ripples, and ripples. Inter‐group comparisons of spike‐rates and HFO‐rates were done by Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test. Predictive values and optimal thresholds were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the epilepsy group (n = 26, 46%), mean rates of ripples (0.3 vs 0.09 / minute, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and spike ripples (0.6 vs 0.06 / minute, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were significantly higher, with no difference in spike rates (1.7 vs 3.0 / minute, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.38). Of those 3 markers, ripples showed the best predictive value (area under the curve [AUC]&lt;sub&gt;ripples&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.88). The optimal threshold for ripples was calculated to be ≥ 0.125 / minute with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 85%. Ripple rates were negatively correlated to days passing before epilepsy‐diagnosis (R = −0.59, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and time to a second seizure (R = −0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.77 to 0.43, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could show that in a cohort of children with a first unprovoked seizure, ripples predict the development of epilepsy better than spikes or spike ripples and might be useful biomarkers in the estimation of prognosis and question of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Modelling the emergence of foodborne pathogens is a crucial step in the prediction and prevention of disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that drive the evolution of such continuously adapting pathogens remain poorly understood. Here, we combine molecular genotyping with network science and Bayesian inference to infer directed genotype networks—and trace the emergence and evolutionary paths—of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhimurium (STM) from nine years of Australian disease surveillance data. We construct networks where nodes represent STM strains and directed edges represent evolutionary steps, presenting evidence that the structural (i.e., network-based) features are relevant to understanding the functional (i.e., fitness-based) progression of co-evolving STM strains. This is argued by showing that outbreak severity, i.e., prevalence, correlates to: (i) the network path length to the most prevalent node (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = −0.613, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 690); and (ii) the network connected-component size (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.739). Moreover, we uncover distinct exploration-exploitation pathways in the genetic space of STM, including a strong evolutionary drive through a transition region. This is examined via the 6,897 distinct evolutionary paths in the directed network, where we observe a dominant 66% of these paths decrease in network centrality, whilst increasing in prevalence. Furthermore, 72.4% of all paths originate in the transition region, with 64% of those following the dominant direction. Further, we find that the length of an evolutionary path strongly correlates to its increase in prevalence (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.497). Combined, these findings indicate that longer evolutionary paths result in genetically rare and virulent strains, which mostly evolve from a single transition point. Our results not only validate our widely-applicable approach for inferring directed genotype networks from data, but also provide a unique insight into the elusive functional and structural drivers of STM bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/skSNwJBSdDk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Knowing the structure of conserved structural RNAs is important to elucidate their function and mechanism of action. However, predicting a conserved RNA structure remains unreliable, even when using a combination of thermodynamic stability and evolutionary covariation information. Here we present a method to predict a conserved RNA structure that combines the following three features. First, it uses significant covariation due to RNA structure and removes spurious covariation due to phylogeny. Second, it uses negative evolutionary information: basepairs that have variation but no significant covariation are prevented from occurring. Lastly, it uses a battery of probabilistic folding algorithms that incorporate all positive covariation into one structure. The method, named CaCoFold (Cascade variation/covariation Constrained Folding algorithm), predicts a nested structure guided by a maximal subset of positive basepairs, and recursively incorporates all remaining positive basepairs into alternative helices. The alternative helices can be compatible with the nested structure such as pseudoknots, or overlapping such as competing structures, base triplets, or other 3D non-antiparallel interactions. We present evidence that CaCoFold predictions are consistent with structures modeled from crystallography.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K6G0tiAudRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microbial community members exhibit various forms of interactions. Taking advantage of the increasing availability of microbiome data, many computational approaches have been developed to infer bacterial interactions from the co-occurrence of microbes across diverse microbial communities. Additionally, the introduction of genome-scale metabolic models have also enabled the inference of cooperative and competitive metabolic interactions between bacterial species. By nature, phylogenetically similar microbial species are more likely to share common functional profiles or biological pathways due to their genomic similarity. Without properly factoring out the phylogenetic relationship, any estimation of the competition and cooperation between species based on functional/pathway profiles may bias downstream applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach for estimating the competition and complementarity indices for a pair of microbial species, adjusted by their phylogenetic distance. An automated pipeline, PhyloMint, was implemented to construct competition and complementarity indices from genome scale metabolic models derived from microbial genomes. Application of our pipeline to 2,815 human-gut associated bacteria showed high correlation between phylogenetic distance and metabolic competition/cooperation indices among bacteria. Using a discretization approach, we were able to detect pairs of bacterial species with cooperation scores significantly higher than the average pairs of bacterial species with similar phylogenetic distances. A network community analysis of high metabolic cooperation but low competition reveals distinct modules of bacterial interactions. Our results suggest that niche differentiation plays a dominant role in microbial interactions, while habitat filtering also plays a role among certain clades of bacterial species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mWEuPZFjMzI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Differences in structure and hibernation mechanism highlight diversification of the microsporidian ribosome</title>

Assembling and powering ribosomes are energy-intensive processes requiring fine-tuned cellular control mechanisms. In organisms operating under strict nutrient limitations, such as pathogenic microsporidia, conservation of energy via ribosomal hibernation and recycling is critical. The mechanisms by which hibernation is achieved in microsporidia, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the ribosome from &lt;i&gt;Paranosema locustae&lt;/i&gt; spores, bound by the conserved eukaryotic hibernation and recycling factor Lso2. The microsporidian Lso2 homolog adopts a V-shaped conformation to bridge the mRNA decoding site and the large subunit tRNA binding sites, providing a reversible ribosome inactivation mechanism. Although microsporidian ribosomes are highly compacted, the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;locustae&lt;/i&gt; ribosome retains several rRNA segments absent in other microsporidia, and represents an intermediate state of rRNA reduction. In one case, the near complete reduction of an expansion segment has resulted in a single bound nucleotide, which may act as an architectural co-factor to stabilize a protein–protein interface. The presented structure highlights the reductive evolution in these emerging pathogens and sheds light on a conserved mechanism for eukaryotic ribosome hibernation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0Rmv0IO0vHM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Multiple systems in macaques for tracking prediction errors and other types of surprise</title>

Animals learn from the past to make predictions. These predictions are adjusted after prediction errors (PEs), i.e., after surprising events. Generally, most reward PE models learn the average expected amount of reward. However, here we demonstrate the existence of distinct mechanisms for detecting other types of surprising events. Six macaques learned to respond to visual stimuli to receive varying amounts of juice rewards. Most trials ended with the delivery of either 1 or 3 juice drops so that animals learned to expect 2 juice drops on average even though instances of precisely 2 drops were rare. To encourage learning, we also included sessions during which the ratio between 1 and 3 drops changed. Additionally, in all sessions, the stimulus sometimes appeared in an unexpected location. Thus, 3 types of surprising events could occur: reward amount surprise (i.e., a scalar reward prediction error), rare reward surprise, and visuospatial surprise. Importantly, we can dissociate scalar reward prediction errors—rewards that deviated from the average reward amount expected—and rare reward events—rewards that accorded with the average reward expectation but that rarely occurred. We linked each type of surprise to a distinct pattern of neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Activity in the vicinity of the dopaminergic midbrain only reflected surprise about the amount of reward. Lateral prefrontal cortex had a more general role in detecting surprising events. Posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex specifically detected RREs regardless of whether they followed average reward amount expectations, but only in learnable reward environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/D-yL7V1x-bs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Orcokinin in the central complex of the locust Schistocerca gregaria: Identification of immunostained neurons and colocalization with other neuroactive substances&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aebe9496-f7bc-4e73-ab9d-a6ec3ffb02ac/cne25062-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex plays a key role in goal directed orientation of insects. Immunocytochemistry shows that the neuropeptide orcokinin is present in the central complex of the desert locust in neurons of all stages of signal processing and likely serves as cotransmitter with GABA and Dip‐allatostatin in certain cell types.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex is a group of highly interconnected neuropils in the insect brain. It is involved in the control of spatial orientation, based on external compass cues and various internal needs. The functional and neurochemical organization of the central complex has been studied in detail in the desert locust &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca gregaria&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to classical neurotransmitters, immunocytochemistry has provided evidence for a major contribution of neuropeptides to neural signalling within the central complex. To complement these data, we have identified all orcokinin‐immunoreactive neurons in the locust central complex and associated brain areas. About 50 bilateral pairs of neurons innervating all substructures of the central complex exhibit orcokinin immunoreactivity. Among these were about 20 columnar neurons, 33 bilateral pairs of tangential neurons of the central body, and seven pairs of tangential neurons of the protocerebral bridge. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different orcokinin‐A type peptides in the desert locust. Double label experiments showed that all orcokinin‐immunostained tangential neurons of the lateral accessory lobe cluster were also immunoreactive for GABA and the GABA‐synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Two types of tangential neurons of the upper division of the central body were, furthermore, also labeled with an antiserum against Dip‐allatostatin I. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide additional insights into the neurochemical organization of the locust central complex and suggest that orcokinin‐peptides of the orcokinin‐A gene act as neuroactive substances at all stages of signal processing in this brain area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resembling letter-by-letter translation, Morse code can be used to investigate various linguistic components by slowing down the cognitive process of language decoding. Using fMRI and Morse code, we investigated patterns of brain activation associated with decoding three-letter words or non-words and making a lexical decision. Our data suggest that early sublexical processing is associated with activation in brain regions that are involved in sound-patterns to phoneme conversion (inferior parietal lobule), phonological output buffer (inferior frontal cortex: pars opercularis) as well as phonological and semantic top-down predictions (inferior frontal cortex: pars triangularis). In addition, later lexico-semantic processing of meaningful stimuli is associated with activation of the phonological lexicon (angular gyrus) and the semantic system (default mode network). Overall, our data indicate that sublexical and lexico-semantic analyses comprise two cognitive processes that rely on neighboring networks in the left frontal cortex and parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Requirement of the C-Terminal Domain of GluA1 in Different Forms of Long-Term Potentiation in the Hippocampus Is Age-Dependent</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is an extensively studied form of long-lasting synaptic plasticity widely regarded as the cellular basis for learning and memory. At the CA1 synapse, there are multiple forms of LTP with distinct properties. Although AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are a key target of LTP expression, whether they are required in all forms of LTP remains unclear. To address this question, we have used our recently developed mouse line, GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt;, where the c-terminal domain (CTD) of the endogenous GluA1 is replaced by that of GluA2. Unlike traditional GluA1 global or conditional KO mice, GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt; mice have no changes in basal AMPAR properties or synaptic transmission allowing a better assessment of GluA1 in synaptic plasticity. We previously showed that these mice are impaired in LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS-LTP), but whether other forms of LTP are also affected in these mice is unknown. In this study, we compared various forms of LTP at CA1 synapses between GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt; and wild-type littermates by using several induction protocols. We show that HFS-LTP is impaired in both juvenile and adult GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS-LTP) is also abolished in juvenile GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, TBS-LTP can still be induced in adult GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but its mechanisms are altered becoming more sensitive to protein synthesis and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors compared to wild type (WT) control. The GluA1&lt;sup&gt;C2KI&lt;/sup&gt; mice are also differentially altered in several forms of LTP induced under whole-cell recording paradigms. These results indicate that the CTD of GluA1 is differentially involved in different forms of LTP at CA1 synapse highlighting the complexity and adaptative potential of LTP expression mechanisms in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides have been attracting an increasing interest in the biomedical field, thus implying the need of a deeper understanding of their impact on cell behavior. In this study we investigate tungsten disulfide (WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a transparent substrate (sapphire) as a platform for neural-like cell culture. We culture SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, using graphene, sapphire and standard culture well as controls. The quality, thickness and homogeneity of the materials is analyzed using atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The cytocompatibility of CVD WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is investigated for the first time by cell viability and differentiation assessment on SH-SY5Y cells. We find that cells differentiated on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, displaying a viability and neurite length comparable with the controls. These findings shine light on the possibility of using WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a cytocompatible material for interfacing neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial, age-related neurological disease characterized by complex pathophysiological dynamics taking place at multiple biological levels, including molecular, genetic, epigenetic, cellular and large-scale brain networks. These alterations account for multiple pathophysiological mechanisms such as brain protein accumulation, neuroinflammatory/neuro-immune processes, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration that eventually lead to cognitive and behavioral decline. Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) signaling have been implicated in the epigenetics and molecular genetics of all neurobiological processes associated with AD pathophysiology. These changes encompass altered miRNA abundance, speciation and complexity in anatomical regions of the CNS targeted by the disease, including modified miRNA expression patterns in brain tissues, the systemic circulation, the extracellular fluid (ECF) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). miRNAs have been investigated as candidate biomarkers for AD diagnosis, disease prediction, prognosis and therapeutic purposes because of their involvement in multiple brain signaling pathways in both health and disease. In this review we will: (i) highlight the significantly heterogeneous nature of miRNA expression and complexity in AD tissues and biofluids; (ii) address how information may be extracted from these data to be used as a diagnostic, prognostic and/or screening tools across the entire continuum of AD, from the preclinical stage, through the prodromal, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase all the way to clinically overt dementia; and (iii) consider how specific miRNA expression patterns could be categorized using miRNA reporters that span AD pathophysiological initiation and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Single Session of Anodal Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Does Not Induce Facilitation of Locomotor Consolidation in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) may cause variable functional impairment. The discrepancy between functional impairment and brain imaging findings in patients with MS (PwMS) might be attributed to differential adaptive and consolidation capacities. Modulating those abilities could contribute to a favorable clinical course of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: We examined the effect of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) on locomotor adaptation and consolidation in PwMS using a split-belt treadmill (SBT) paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 40 PwMS and 30 matched healthy controls performed a locomotor adaptation task on a SBT. First, we assessed locomotor adaptation in PwMS. In a second investigation, this training was followed by cerebellar anodal tDCS applied immediately after the task ipsilateral to the fast leg (T0). The SBT paradigm was repeated 24 h (T1) and 78 h (T2) post-stimulation to evaluate consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The gait dynamics and adaptation on the SBT were comparable between PwMS and controls. We found no effects of offline cerebellar anodal tDCS on locomotor adaptation and consolidation. Participants who received the active stimulation showed the same retention index than sham-stimulated subjects at T1 (p = 0.33) and T2 (p = 0.46).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Locomotor adaptation is preserved in people with mild-to-moderate MS. However, cerebellar anodal tDCS applied immediately post-training does not further enhance this ability. Future studies should define the neurobiological substrates of maintained plasticity in PwMS and how these substrates can be manipulated to improve compensation. Systematic assessments of methodological variables for cerebellar tDCS are urgently needed to increase the consistency and replicability of the results across experiments in various settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Inter- and Intra-individual Variability in Brain Oscillations During Sports Motor Imagery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576241</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576241</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this work was to re-evaluate electrophysiological data from a previous study on motor imagery (MI) with a special focus on observed inter- and intra-individual differences. More concretely, we investigated event-related desynchronization/synchronization patterns during sports MI (playing tennis) compared with simple MI (squeezing a ball) and discovered high variability across participants. Thirty healthy volunteers were divided in two groups; the experimental group (EG) performed a physical exercise between two imagery sessions, and the control group (CG) watched a landscape movie without physical activity. We computed inter-individual differences by assessing the dissimilarities among subjects for each group, condition, time period, and frequency band. In the alpha band, we observe some clustering in the ranking of the subjects, therefore showing smaller distances than others. Moreover, in our statistical evaluation, we observed a consistency in ranking across time periods both for the EG and for the CG. For the latter, we also observed similar rankings across conditions. On the contrary, in the beta band, the ranking of the subjects was more similar for the EG across conditions and time periods than for the subjects of the CG. With this study, we would like to draw attention to variability measures instead of primarily focusing on the identification of common patterns across participants, which often do not reflect the whole neurophysiological reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mismatch Negativity Is Not Always Modulated by Lexicality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.556457</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.556457</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One factor that is commonly thought to influence MMN amplitude is lexicality; multiple studies have shown that real-word deviants elicit larger MMNs than pseudoword deviants. Here, however, we report data from two experiments challenging this assumption. In the first experiment (N = 48), real-word deviants did not elicit more negative MMNs than pseudoword deviants; the acoustic difference between standard and deviant was identical across these comparisons. In this experiment, the pseudoword deviant [pʰa˨˩] differed from a real-word [pʰa˧˥] in tone only; therefore, to test the possibility that the lexicality effect is real but is restricted to pseudowords that differ from real words by at least one segment, we ran a second experiment which included different items and participants, and also included a control comparison in which the pseudoword ([tsʰei˨˩]) differs from all real words by at least one segment (there is no existing Mandarin morpheme pronounced [tsʰei] in any tone). In the second experiment (N = 36), both types of pseudowords failed to elicit less negative MMNs than real words. These findings, together with other recent studies failing to show lexicality effects in MMN, challenge the assumption that wordhood reliably influences MMN amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortico-Hippocampal Brain Connectivity-Guided Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Enhances Face-Cued Word-Based Associative Memory in the Short Term</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.541791</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used to enhance the associative memory of healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the question of where the stimulation should be applied is still unresolved. In a preliminary survey for an effective and feasible solution to this problem, we identified three representative rTMS targets using cortico-hippocampal connectivity, calculated using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from 80 young, healthy subjects: (1) the cortical area with the strongest connectivity across the whole cerebral cortical area; (2) the whole lateral parietal cortical area; and (3) the whole medial prefrontal cortical area. We then compared the short-term effects on associative memory, which was tested using face-cued word recall by applying rTMS to three identified targets in a single population of eight healthy adults. Each treatment lasted for 2 days. Associative memory performance was measured at four time points: before and after stimulation on the first day (baseline and post 1) and before and after stimulation on the second day (post 2 and post 3). Compared with baseline levels, 20 min of high-frequency rTMS delivered to target 2 or target 3 produced a significant increase in the mean accuracy of associative memory performance at the post 3 time point alone (target 2, P = 0.0035; target 3, P = 0.0012). Compared with the sham conditions, significant increases in the mean associative memory performance were observed when high-frequency rTMS was delivered to target 2 (P = 0.02) and target 3 (P = 0.012), but not when delivered to target 1 (P = 0.1). Compared with baseline levels, 20 min of high-frequency rTMS delivered to target 3 produced a significant reduction in the mean reaction time of associative memory only at time points post 1 (P = 0.0464) and post 3 (P = 0.0477). Compared with the sham conditions, significant reductions in the mean reaction time of associative memory were observed when high-frequency rTMS was delivered to target 3 (P = 0.006), but not when delivered to target 1 (P = 0.471) or target 2 (P = 0.365). Our findings indicate that stimulation of the locations with the strongest cortico-hippocampal connectivity within the lateral parietal cortical or medial prefrontal cortical areas is effective in enhancing face–word recall-based associative memory in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Layer 3→5 Circuit in Auditory Cortex That Contributes to Pre-pulse Inhibition of the Acoustic Startle Response</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.553208</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While connectivity within sensory cortical circuits has been studied extensively, how these connections contribute to perception and behavior is not well understood. Here we tested the role of a circuit between layers 3 and 5 of auditory cortex in sound detection. We measured sound detection using a common variant of pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, in which a silent gap in background noise acts as a cue that attenuates startle. We used the Nr5a-Cre driver line, which we found drove expression in the auditory cortex restricted predominantly to layer 3. Photoactivation of these cells evoked short-latency, highly reliable spiking in downstream layer 5 neurons, and attenuated startle responses similarly to gaps in noise. Photosuppression of these cells did not affect behavioral gap detection. Our data provide the first demonstration that direct activation of auditory cortical neurons is sufficient to attenuate the acoustic startle response, similar to the detection of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: G Protein-Coupled Receptor Heteromers as Putative Pharmacotherapeutic Targets in Autism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.588662</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.588662</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in the development of pharmacotherapies for autism is the failure to identify pathophysiological mechanisms that could be targetable. The majority of developing strategies mainly aim at restoring the brain excitatory/inhibitory imbalance described in autism, by targeting glutamate or GABA receptors. Other neurotransmitter systems are critical for the fine-tuning of the brain excitation/inhibition balance. Among these, the dopaminergic, oxytocinergic, serotonergic, and cannabinoid systems have also been implicated in autism and thus represent putative therapeutic targets. One of the latest breakthroughs in pharmacology has been the discovery of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization. GPCR heteromers are macromolecular complexes composed of at least two different receptors, with biochemical properties that differ from those of their individual components, leading to the activation of different cellular signaling pathways. Interestingly, heteromers of the above-mentioned neurotransmitter receptors have been described (e.g., mGlu2–5HT2A, mGlu5–D2–A2A, D2–OXT, CB1–D2, D2–5HT2A, D1–D2, D2–D3, and OXT–5HT2A). We hypothesize that differences in the GPCR interactome may underlie the etiology/pathophysiology of autism and could drive different treatment responses, as has already been suggested for other brain disorders such as schizophrenia. Targeting GPCR complexes instead of monomers represents a new order of biased agonism/antagonism that may potentially enhance the efficacy of future pharmacotherapies. Here, we present an overview of the crosstalk of the different GPCRs involved in autism and discuss current advances in pharmacological approaches targeting them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Effect of IDO on Neural Progenitor Cell Survival Under Oxygen Glucose Deprivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581861</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581861</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity plays an important role in many neurological disorders in the central nervous system, which may be associated with immunomodulation or anti-inflammatory activity. However, the action of IDO in the ischemic condition is still poorly understood. The purpose of the present study is to explore the expression and action of IDO in stem cell culture under oxygen and glucose deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Neural progenitor cells were obtained from the human embryonic stem cell line BG01. These cells underwent oxygen and glucose deprivation. We examined the IDO expression at 3 and 8 h of oxygen and glucose deprivation and then examined neuronal progenitor cell viability in the normal and oxygen and glucose deprivation condition using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. In addition, we studied the effect of IDO inhibition and the expression of TNF-α, IGF-1, VEGF, IL-6, FGFβ, TGFβ, EGF, and Leptin to explore the mechanism of IDO under the oxygen and glucose deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: IDO expression in neural progenitor cells increased under oxygen and glucose deprivation, which is closely associated with cell death (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Inhibiting IDO did not affect cell survival in normal neural progenitor cells. However, inhibiting IDO could attenuate cell viability under oxygen and glucose deprivation (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Further study demonstrated that IDO expression was closely associated to the growth factor’s leptin expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that an increase of IDO under oxygen and glucose deprivation was associated with cell death, suggesting that inhibiting IDO could be a target for neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the elder population, pathologically characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. While the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD remain unknown, various genetic factors have been proved to be associated with PD. To date, at least 23 loci and 19 disease-causing genes for PD have been identified. Although monogenic (often familial) cases account for less than 5% of all PD patients, exploring the phenotypes of monogenic PD can help us understand the disease pathogenesis and progression. Primary motor symptoms are important for PD diagnosis but only detectable at a relatively late stage. Despite typical motor symptoms, various non-motor symptoms (NMS) including sensory complaints, mental disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and sleep disturbances also have negative impacts on the quality of life in PD patients and pose major challenges for disease management. NMS is common in all stages of the PD course. NMS can occur long before the onset of PD motor symptoms or can present in the middle or late stage of the disease accompanied by motor symptoms. Therefore, the profiling and characterization of NMS in monogenic PD may help the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, which thereby can execute early intervention to delay the disease progression. In this review, we summarize the characteristics, clinical phenotypes, especially the NMS of monogenic PD patients carrying mutations of SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, and GBA. The clinical implications of this linkage between NMS and PD-related genes are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus and Elderly Acquired Hydrocephalus: Evaluation With Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow and Ventricular Volume Parameters</title>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To investigate differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the aqueduct and to determine whether there is a relationship between CSF flow and ventricular volume parameters in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, elderly acquired hydrocephalus patients and age-matched healthy volunteers by phase-contrast MR (PC-MR).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 40 iNPH patients and 41 elderly acquired hydrocephalus patients and 26 age-matched healthy volunteers in the normal control (NC) group were included between November 2017 and October 2019 in this retrospective study. The following CSF flow parameters were measured with PC-MR: peak velocity, average velocity (AV), aqueductal stroke volume (ASV), net ASV, and net flow. The following ventricular volume parameters were measured: ventricular volume (VV), brain volume, total intracranial volume, and relative VV. Differences between the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups were compared Mann–Whitney U test and correlations between CSF flow and ventricular volume parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Aqueductal stroke volume was significantly higher in the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups than in the NC group, but did not differ significantly between the iNPH group and acquired hydrocephalus group. The AV, net ASV, and net flow in the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), and those in the acquired hydrocephalus group were significantly higher than those in the iNPH group (P = 0.01, P = 0.007, P = 0.002, respectively). The direction of the AV and net ASV significantly differed among the three groups. There were no associations between the volume parameters and CSF flow according to PC-MR among the three groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Compared with iNPH, elderly acquired hydrocephalus demonstrated higher CSF hyperdynamic flow. Although increased CSF flow may contribute to further changes in ventricular morphology, there is no linear relationship between them. These findings might help increase our understanding of flow dynamics in iNPH and elderly acquired hydrocephalus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Associating Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factor Genes and FDG-PET Brain Metabolism in Normal Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580633</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580633</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Several studies have linked type 2 diabetes (T2D) to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to an interest in using antidiabetic treatments for the prevention of AD. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining the relationship between T2D and AD have not been completely elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Our objective was to examine cerebral &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake during normal aging and in AD patients in regions associated with diabetes genetic risk factor expression to highlight which genes may serve as potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We calculated regional glucose metabolism differences in units of standardized uptake values (SUVR) for 386 cognitively healthy adults and 335 clinically probable AD patients. We then proceeded to extract gene-expression data from the publicly available Allen Human Brain Atlas (HBA) database. We used the nearest genes to 46 AD- and T2D-associated SNPs previously identified in the literature, and mapped their expression to the same 34 cortical regions in which we calculated SUVRs. SNPs with a donor consistency of 0.40 or greater were selected for further analysis. We evaluated the associations between SUVR and gene-expression across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Of the 46 risk-factor genes, 15 were found to be significantly correlated with FDG-PET brain metabolism in healthy adults and probable AD patients after correction for multiple comparisons. Using multiple regression, we found that five genes explained a total of 72.5% of the SUVR variance across the healthy adult group regions, while four genes explained a total of 79.3% of the SUVR variance across the probable AD group regions. There were significant differences in whole-brain SUVR as a function of allele frequencies for two genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results highlight the association between risk factor genes for T2D and regional glucose metabolism during both normal aging and in probable AD. Highlighted genes were associated with mitochondrial stability, vascular maintenance, and glucose intolerance. Pharmacological intervention of these pathways has the potential to improve glucose metabolism during normal again as well as in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Minimal data are available on the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older Chinese adults. Moreover, the current information on MCI shows important geographical variations.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for MCI by age and sex among older adults in a North Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this population-based cross-sectional study, we enrolled a random sample of 4,943 adults aged ≥ 60 years between March 2018 and June 2019 in Tianjin, China. Of these, 312 individuals were excluded due to a lack of data (e.g., fasting blood test). As a result, 4,631 subjects were assessed. Individuals with MCI were identified using neuropsychological assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and Activities of Daily Living scale, based on a modified version of the Petersen’s criteria.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean (SD) age of the 4,631 participants was 67.6 (4.89) years, and 2,579 (55.7%) were female. The overall age- and sex-standardized prevalence of MCI in our study population was 10.7%. There were significant associations of MCI with age [65–69 vs. 60–64 years, OR = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 0.96], physical activity (≥23.0 vs. &amp;lt;23.0 MET-hours/week, OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.96), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.95), grip strength (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.67), hypertension (yes vs. no, OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.77), higher levels of sleepiness (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.37), and longer sleep duration (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.72). The inverse association between BMI and MCI was stronger in older age groups (P for heterogeneity = 0.003). Moreover, the magnitude of association between triglycerides and MCI was different between the sexes (P for heterogeneity = 0.029).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of MCI was 10.7% in the study sample. Physical activity, BMI, grip strength, sleepiness, sleep duration, and hypertension were associated with the prevalence of MCI. Additionally, triglycerides and BMI might be differently associated with the presence of MCI for different sexes and age stages, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Non-Latino Black adults have greater risk for Alzheimer’s dementia compared to non-Latino White adults, possibly due to factors disproportionally affecting Black adults including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic peripheral inflammation is implicated in both Alzheimer’s dementia and CVD and is known to impact cognition and cerebral white matter, yet little work has examined these associations by race. This study examined associations between inflammation, cognition, and cerebral white matter generally, and by race.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eighty-six non-demented older Black and White participants (age = 69.03; 50% female; 45% Black participants) underwent fasting venipuncture, cognitive testing, and MRI. Serum was assayed for interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 1-beta. Cognitive domains included memory, executive function, and attention/information processing. MRI measures included white matter hyperintensity volumes (WMH) and quantification of white matter integrity in areas outside WMHs via DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity, as well as multi-component relaxometry derived myelin water fraction (MWF).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Black and White participants did not differ on age, sex, or CVD risk. Separate linear regression models adjusting for relevant confounders revealed that higher IL-6 associated with lower executive function and higher CRP levels associated with lower FA and MWF. Stratified analyses revealed that these association were significant for Black participants only.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that peripheral inflammation is inversely associated with select cognitive domains and white matter integrity (but not WMHs), particularly in older Black adults. It is important to consider race when investigating inflammatory associates of brain and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Association Between Leukocyte Telomere Length and Cognitive Performance Among the American Elderly</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Age-related cognitive decline begins in middle age and persists with age. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) decreases with age and is enhanced by inflammation and oxidative stress. However, whether shorter LTL correlates with cognitive decline remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;Aims&lt;p&gt;We aimed to investigate the relationship between LTL and cognitive decline in the American elderly.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used data from the 1999 to 2002 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We included participants aged 65–80 with available data on LTL and cognitive assessments. The cognitive function assessment used the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). We applied multivariate modeling to estimate the association between LTL and cognitive performance. Additionally, to ensure robust data analysis, we converted LTL into categorical variables through quartile and then calculated the P for trend.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, cardiovascular disease (CAD) score, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and educational level, LTL showed a positive correlation with DSST score (odds ratio [OR] 3.47 [0.14, 6.79], P = 0.04). Additionally, to further quantify the LTL–DSST interaction, we found a similar trend when LTL was regarded as a categorical variable (quartile) (P for trend = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;LTL was associated with cognitive capabilities among the elderly, implying that LTL might be a biomarker of cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite being the focus of a thriving field of research, the biological mechanisms that underlie information integration in the brain are not yet fully understood. A theory that has gained a lot of traction in recent years suggests that multi-scale integration is regulated by a hierarchy of mutually interacting neural oscillations. In particular, there is accumulating evidence that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a specific form of cross-frequency interaction, plays a key role in numerous cognitive processes. Current research in the field is not only hampered by the absence of a gold standard for PAC analysis, but also by the computational costs of running exhaustive computations on large and high-dimensional electrophysiological brain signals. In addition, various signal properties and analyses parameters can lead to spurious PAC. Here, we present Tensorpac, an open-source Python toolbox dedicated to PAC analysis of neurophysiological data. The advantages of Tensorpac include (1) higher computational efficiency thanks to software design that combines tensor computations and parallel computing, (2) the implementation of all most widely used PAC methods in one package, (3) the statistical analysis of PAC measures, and (4) extended PAC visualization capabilities. Tensorpac is distributed under a BSD-3-Clause license and can be launched on any operating system (Linux, OSX and Windows). It can be installed directly via pip or downloaded from Github (https://github.com/EtienneCmb/tensorpac). By making Tensorpac available, we aim to enhance the reproducibility and quality of PAC research, and provide open tools that will accelerate future method development in neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iq6GiJmrKnY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A transcriptome-based classifier to determine molecular subtypes in medulloblastoma</title>

Medulloblastoma is a highly heterogeneous pediatric brain tumor with five molecular subtypes, Sonic Hedgehog &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt;-mutant, Sonic Hedgehog &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt;-wildtype, WNT, Group 3, and Group 4, defined by the World Health Organization. The current mechanism for classification into these molecular subtypes is through the use of immunostaining, methylation, and/or genetics. We surveyed the literature and identified a number of RNA-Seq and microarray datasets in order to develop, train, test, and validate a robust classifier to identify medulloblastoma molecular subtypes through the use of transcriptomic profiling data. We have developed a GPL-3 licensed R package and a Shiny Application to enable users to quickly and robustly classify medulloblastoma samples using transcriptomic data. The classifier utilizes a large composite microarray dataset (15 individual datasets), an individual microarray study, and an RNA-Seq dataset, using gene ratios instead of gene expression measures as features for the model. Discriminating features were identified using the limma R package and samples were classified using an unweighted mean of normalized scores. We utilized two training datasets and applied the classifier in 15 separate datasets. We observed a minimum accuracy of 85.71% in the smallest dataset and a maximum of 100% accuracy in four datasets with an overall median accuracy of 97.8% across the 15 datasets, with the majority of misclassification occurring between the heterogeneous Group 3 and Group 4 subtypes. We anticipate this medulloblastoma transcriptomic subtype classifier will be broadly applicable to the cancer research and clinical communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rglOJWqQzDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Jarić, Uri Roll, Robert Arlinghaus, Jonathan Belmaker, Yan Chen, Victor China, Karel Douda, Franz Essl, Sonja C. Jähnig, Jonathan M. Jeschke, Gregor Kalinkat, Lukáš Kalous, Richard Ladle, Robert J. Lennox, Rui Rosa, Valerio Sbragaglia, Kate Sherren, Marek Šmejkal, Andrea Soriano-Redondo, Allan T. Souza, Christian Wolter, Ricardo A. Correia&lt;/p&gt;

The ongoing digital revolution in the age of big data is opening new research opportunities. Culturomics and iEcology, two emerging research areas based on the analysis of online data resources, can provide novel scientific insights and inform conservation and management efforts. To date, culturomics and iEcology have been applied primarily in the terrestrial realm. Here, we advocate for expanding such applications to the aquatic realm by providing a brief overview of these new approaches and outlining key areas in which culturomics and iEcology are likely to have the highest impact, including the management of protected areas; fisheries; flagship species identification; detection and distribution of threatened, rare, and alien species; assessment of ecosystem status and anthropogenic impacts; and social impact assessment. When deployed in the right context with awareness of potential biases, culturomics and iEcology are ripe for rapid development as low-cost research approaches based on data available from digital sources, with increasingly diverse applications for aquatic ecosystems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Mzkqq_k1zYw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Distribution and co‐expression of adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA in the mouse inferior colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25053?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25053?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and co‐expression of adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA in the mouse inferior colliculus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4dd24ab1-366c-4cf8-8bdb-8487658d3cbc/cne25053-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus (IC) is the primary auditory nucleus of the midbrain. We used multichannel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1A,B,D&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; encoding mRNA in the mouse IC. We found expression of mRNA encoding these adrenergic receptors in the three subnuclei of the IC in juveniles and adults.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrenergic receptors are mediators of adrenergic and noradrenergic modulation throughout the brain. Previous studies have provided evidence for the expression of adrenergic receptors in the midbrain auditory nucleus, the inferior colliculus (IC), but have not examined the cellular patterns of expression in detail. Here, we utilize multichannel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect the expression of adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA in the inferior colliculus of male and female mice. We found expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA throughout all areas of the IC. While we observed similar levels of expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA across the subregions of the IC, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA was expressed differentially. To account for developmental changes in noradrenergic receptor expression, we measured expression levels in mice aged P15, P20, and P60. We observed little change in levels of expression across these ages. To ascertain the modulatory potential of multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes in a single IC cell, we measured co‐expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA. We found greater proportions of cells in the IC that expressed no adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, α1 and α2A adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, and α1, α2A, and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA than would be predicted by independent expression of each receptor subtype. These data suggest a coordinated pattern of adrenergic receptor expression in the IC and provide the first evidence for adrenergic receptor expression and co‐expression in the subregions of the mouse auditory midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) gene is associated with epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), and developmental delay, suggesting its critical role in proper neuronal development and function. CYFIP2 is involved in regulating cellular actin dynamics and also interacts with RNA-binding proteins. However, the adult brain function of CYFIP2 remains unclear because investigations thus far are limited to Cyfip2 heterozygous (Cyfip2&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mice owing to the perinatal lethality of Cyfip2-null mice. Therefore, we generated Cyfip2 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with reduced CYFIP2 expression in postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons (CaMKIIα-Cre). We found that in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of adult Cyfip2 cKO mice, CYFIP2 expression was decreased in both layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) neurons, unlike the L5-specific CYFIP2 reduction observed in adult Cyfip2&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Nevertheless, filamentous actin (F-actin) levels were increased only in L5 of Cyfip2 cKO mPFC possibly because of a compensatory increase in CYFIP1, the other member of CYFIP family, in L2/3 neurons. Abnormal dendritic spines on basal, but not on apical, dendrites were consistently observed in L5 neurons of Cyfip2 cKO mPFC. Meanwhile, neuronal excitability and activity were enhanced in both L2/3 and L5 neurons of Cyfip2 cKO mPFC, suggesting that CYFIP2 functions of regulating F-actin and excitability/activity may be mediated through independent mechanisms. Unexpectedly, adult Cyfip2 cKO mice did not display locomotor hyperactivity or reduced anxiety observed in Cyfip2&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Instead, both exhibited enhanced social dominance accessed by the tube test. Together, these results provide additional insights into the functions of CYFIP2 in the adult brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Effects of CYP46A1 Inhibition on Long-Term-Depression in Hippocampal Slices ex vivo and 24S-Hydroxycholesterol Levels in Mice in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of cholesterol and its metabolites has been hypothesized to be therapeutically beneficial for mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, and epilepsies. A major regulator of cholesterol clearance and turnover in the central nervous system is CYP46A1, a brain enriched enzyme responsible for metabolism of cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Inhibition of this enzyme may negatively modulate NMDARs as 24S-hydroxycholesterol was shown to enhance NMDAR function. In addition, alterations of local cholesterol or other changes mediated by CYP46A1 activity could have important influences on central nervous system function. Here we demonstrate that humans and mice display brain region specific and similar CYP46A1 and 24S-hydroxycholesterol distribution. Treatment with distinct classes of CYP46A1 inhibitors led to central 24S-hydroxycholesterol reduction in vivo and ablation of long term depression in hippocampal slices. Our results suggest that rodents show similarity to humans for studying the impact of CYP46A1 inhibitors and that rapid, local modulation of oxysterols can be achieved through CYP46A1 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Molecular Simulation Study of nNOS Activation Induced by the Interaction Between Its Calmodulin-Binding Domain and SUMO1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.535494</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), an enzyme required for learning and memory, catalyzes L-arginine decomposition during nitric oxide production in mammalian neurons. Over-activation of nNOS leads to oxidative/nitrosative stress, which is part of the pathophysiological process of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous experimental studies suggest that nNOS is a target for small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1), and that SUMO1-ylation upregulates nNOS catalytic activity in hippocampal neurons. To date, a comprehensive structural model has not been proposed for nNOS SUMO1-ylation. In this study, our aim was to build in silico models to identify the non-bonded interactions between SUMO1 and the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) of nNOS. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, we found that SUMO1 modification stabilizes the conformation of nNOS CaMBD, and helps maintain a conformation beneficial for nNOS catalysis. Analysis of the polar contacts and hydrogen bonds, and the root mean square derivation results showed that R726 and R727 of CaMBD formed polar contacts or high occupancy hydrogen bonds with SUMO1. Correlation factor analysis and free energy calculations showed that the W716, L734, F740, M745, and F781 residues were also involved in the SUMO1/CaMBD interaction in an orientation-dependent manner. The potential inhibitor binding pocket of SUMO1, aimed at disrupting SUMO1/CaMBD binding, was detected from the virtual screening results. Our in silico studies revealed that interfering with the non-bonded interactions of SUMO1/CaMBD would blocked nNOS SUMO-ylation and subsequent hyperactivation. This work provides novel structural insight into the functional regulation of nNOS by post-translational SUMO1 modification, and provides suggestions for the design of drugs targeting nNOS hyperactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Wireless Measurement of Sympathetic Arousal During in vivo Occupational Therapy Sessions</title>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;One goal of occupational therapists working with children who have sensory processing challenges is the regulation of arousal. Regulation strategies have not been evaluated using an empirical measure of physiological arousal.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To establish the feasibility of using an objective physiologic measure of sympathetic arousal in therapeutic settings and explore the relation between therapeutic activities and sympathetic arousal. To evaluate changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) during occupational therapy sessions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two children identified with sensory modulation dysfunction (SMD) wore a wireless EDA sensor during 50 min occupational therapy sessions (n = 77 sessions).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All children were able to wear the sensor on the lower calf without being distracted by the device. The five insights below are based on a comparison of EDA recordings in relation to therapists’ reflections describing how sympathetic arousal might correspond to therapeutic activities.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Objective physiological assessment of a child’s sympathetic arousal during therapy is possible using a wireless EDA measurement system. Changes in EDA may correspond directly with therapeutic activities. The article provides a foundation for designing future therapeutic studies that include continuous measures of EDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Origin of the Time Lag Phenomenon and the Global Signal in Resting-State fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.596084</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.596084</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The global mean signal of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) shows a characteristic spatiotemporal pattern that is closely related to the pattern of vascular perfusion. Although being increasingly adopted in the mapping of the flow of neural activity, the mechanism that gives rise to the BOLD signal time lag remains controversial. In the present study, we compared the time lag of the global mean signal with those of the local network components obtained by applying temporal independent component analysis to the resting-state fMRI data, as well as by using simultaneous wide-field visual stimulation, and demonstrated that the time lag patterns are highly similar across all types of data. These results suggest that the time lag of the rs-fMRI signal reflects the local variance of the hemodynamic responses rather than the arrival or transit time of the stimulus, whether the trigger is neuronal or non-neuronal in origin as long as it is mediated by local hemodynamic responses. Examinations of the internal carotid artery signal further confirmed that the arterial signal is tightly inversely coupled with the global mean signal in accordance with previous studies, presumably reflecting the blood flow or blood pressure changes that are occurring almost simultaneously in the internal carotid artery and the cerebral pial/capillary arteries, within the low-frequency component in human rs-fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.594235</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Possible risks stemming from the employment of novel, micrometer-thin printed electrodes for direct current neural stimulation are discussed. To assess those risks, electrochemical methods are used, including cyclic voltammetry, square-wave voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Experiments were conducted in non-deoxidized phosphate-buffered saline to better emulate living organism conditions. Since preliminary results obtained have shown unexpected oxidation peaks in 0–0.4 V potential range, the source of those was further investigated. Hypothesized redox activity of printing paste components was disproven, supporting further development of proposed fabrication technology of stimulating electrodes. Finally, partial permeability and resulting electrochemical activity of underlying silver-based printed layers of the device were pointed as the source of potential tissue irritation or damage. Employing this information, electrodes with corrected design were investigated, yielding no undesired redox processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Structural Brain Changes in Blepharospasm: A Cortical Thickness and Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.543802</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.543802</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter abnormalities in blepharospasm (BSP) have been evaluated using conventional intra-voxel metrics, and changes in patterns of cortical thickness in BSP remain controversial. We aimed to determine whether local diffusion homogeneity, an inter-voxel diffusivity metric, could be valuable in detecting white matter abnormalities for BSP; whether these changes are related to disease features; and whether cortical thickness changes occur in BSP patients. Diffusion tensor and structural magnetic resonance imaging were collected for 29 patients with BSP and 30 healthy controls. Intergroup diffusion differences were compared using tract-based spatial statistics analysis and measures of cortical thickness were obtained. The relationship among cortical thickness, diffusion metric in significantly different regions, and behavioral measures were further assessed. There were no significant differences in cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy between the groups. Local diffusion homogeneity was higher in BSP patients than controls, primarily in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, left posterior corona radiata, and left posterior thalamic radiata (P &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected). The local diffusion homogeneity values in these regions were positively correlated with the Jankovic rating scale (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.416, P = 0.031) and BSP disability index (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.453, P = 0.018) in BSP patients. These results suggest that intra- and inter-voxel diffusive parameters are differentially sensitive to detecting BSP-related white matter abnormalities and that local diffusion homogeneity might be useful in assessing disability in BSP patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dexmedetomidine – Commonly Used in Functional Imaging Studies – Increases Susceptibility to Seizures in Rats But Not in Wild Type Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00832</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00832</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI (fMRI) utilizes changes in metabolic and hemodynamic signals to indirectly infer the underlying local changes in neuronal activity. To investigate the mechanisms of fMRI responses, spontaneous fluctuations, and functional connectivity in the resting-state, it is important to pursue fMRI in animal models. Animal studies commonly use dexmedetomidine sedation. It has been demonstrated that potent sensory stimuli administered under dexmedetomidine are prone to inducing seizures in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Here we combined optical imaging of intrinsic signals and cerebral blood flow with neurophysiological recordings to measure responses in rat area S1FL to electrical forepaw stimulation administered at 8 Hz. We show that the increased susceptibility to seizures starts no later than 1 h and ends no sooner than 3 h after initiating a continuous administration of dexmedetomidine. By administering different combinations of anesthetic and sedative agents, we demonstrate that dexmedetomidine is the sole agent necessary for the increased susceptibility to seizures. The increased susceptibility to seizures prevails under a combination of 0.3–0.5% isoflurane and dexmedetomidine anesthesia. The blood-oxygenation and cerebral blood flow responses to seizures induced by forepaw stimulation have a higher amplitude and a larger spatial extent relative to physiological responses to the same stimuli. The epileptic activity and the associated blood oxygenation and cerebral blood flow responses stretched beyond the stimulation period. We observed seizures in response to forepaw stimulation with 1–2 mA pulses administered at 8 Hz. In contrast, responses to stimuli administered at 4 Hz were seizure-free. We demonstrate that such seizures are generated not only in SD rats but also in Long-Evans rats, but not in C57BL6 mice stimulated with similar potent stimuli under dexmedetomidine sedation. We conclude that high-amplitude hemodynamic functional imaging responses evoked by peripheral stimulation in rats sedated with dexmedetomidine are possibly due to the induction of epileptic activity. Therefore, caution should be practiced in experiments that combine the administration of potent stimuli with dexmedetomidine sedation. We propose stimulation paradigms that elicit seizure-free, well detectable neurophysiological and hemodynamic responses in rats. We further conclude that the increased susceptibility to seizures under dexmedetomidine sedation is species dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: P300-Based Brain-Computer Interface Speller: Usability Evaluation of Three Speller Sizes by Severely Motor-Disabled Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers allow severe motor-disabled patients to communicate using their brain activity without muscular mobility. Different visual configurations of the widely studied P300-based BCI speller had been assessed with healthy and motor-disabled users. However, the speller size (in terms of cm) had only been assessed for healthy subjects. We think that the speller size might be limiting for some severely motor-disabled patients with restricted head and eye movements. The usability of three speller sizes was assessed for seven patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a participant diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This is the first usability evaluation of speller size with severely motor-disabled participants. Effectiveness (in the online results) and efficiency (in the workload test) of the medium speller was remarkably better. Satisfaction was significantly the highest with the medium size speller and the lowest with the small size. These results correlate with previously described findings in healthy subjects. In conclusion, the speller size should be considered when designing a speller paradigm, especially for motor-disabled individuals, since it might affect their performance and user experience while controlling a BCI speller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Higher Trait Impulsivity and Altered Frontostriatal Connectivity in Betel-Quid Dependent Individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578913</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578913</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Betel quid dependency (BQD) is characterized by functional and structural brain alterations. Trait impulsivity may influence substance dependence by impacting its neurobiological underpinnings in the frontostriatal circuit. However, little is known about the trait impulsivity and its neural correlates in individuals with BQD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty-eight participants with BQD and 22 normal controls (NCs) were recruited and scanned on a 3T MRI scanner. Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS) was used to measure trait impulsivity: motor, attention, and no plan impulsivity. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess the relationship between trait impulsivity and gray matter volumes. The relevant clusters identified were served as regions of interest (ROI) seeds. The whole-volume psycho-physiological interactions (PPI) analysis was used to investigate the changes of functional connectivity related to ROI seeds in the cue-reactivity task condition (BQ and control images).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Behaviorally, the BQD group showed significantly higher trait impulsivity including motor and no plan impulsivity than the NCs group. VBM analyses showed that motor impulsivity was negatively associated with gray matter volume of right caudate in the whole sample. No difference in gray matter volume between the two groups was observed. PPI analyses showed that there was a significantly decreased functional connectivity between the right caudate and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when watching BQ related images than control images in individuals with BQD. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the right caudate and right DLPFC was negatively correlated with BQ dependency scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the structural basis of trait impulsivity in the caudate and provided evidence for abnormal interactions within frontostriatal circuitsin individuals with BQD, which may provide insight into the selection of potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of BQ dependency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Employment and Work Ability of Persons With Brain Tumors: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.571191</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain tumors (BT) are between the eight most common cancers among persons aged 40 years, with an average survival time of 10 years for patients affected by non-malignant brain tumor. Some patients continue to work, reporting difficulties in work-related activities, or even job loss. The purpose of the present study was to review the existing information about the ability people with BT to return to work and to identify factors associated with job loss. We performed a systematic review on SCOPUS and EMBASE for peer-reviewed papers that reported studies assessing work ability in patients with BT that were published in the period from January 2010 to January 2020. Out of 800 identified records, 7 articles were selected for analysis, in which 1,507 participants with BT were enrolled overall. Three main themes emerged: the impact of neuropsychological functioning on work productivity, the change of employment status for long-term survivors and issues related to return to work processes. Based on the results of selected studies, it can be concluded that the impact of BT on workforce participation is determined by depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits, as well as by high short-term mortality but also on environmental barriers. Vocational Rehabilitation programs should be implemented to help patients wishing to return to or maintain their current work, as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Older Adults Encode Task-Irrelevant Stimuli, but Can This Side-Effect be Useful to Them?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569614</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569614</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We studied whether, due to deteriorating inhibitory functions, older people are more likely to process irrelevant stimuli; and if so, could they later use this information better than young adults. In the study phase of our experiment, a Posner-type gaze-cued version of a Simon task was performed in which we presented task-irrelevant cues, where faces or patches with either left- or right-looking dots for the pupil of the eye preceded the task to press a button congruent or incongruent with the presentation side of the target stimulus. In the follow-up test phase, participants completed an unexpected facial recognition test. In the study phase not only a decreased P1, but also an increased N170 amplitude of the event-related potentials (ERPs) were found in older, compared to younger adults, and also for faces compared to patches. Even though in the test phase both age-groups could recognize the faces better than statistically by chance, neither the older nor the younger participants could discriminate them effectively. The late positive component (LPC)—the ERP correlates of the old/new effect, being the higher amplitude for the earlier presented stimuli when compared with the unseen stimuli during the recognition test—was not evolved in the older group, while a reversed old/new effect was seen in younger participants: higher amplitude was found in New-Right and Old-Wrong conditions (for faces they did not recognize independent of seeing them before) compared to Old-Right and New-Wrong conditions (for faces they thought they recognized from the study phase). In conclusion, although older adults showed enhanced processing of task-irrelevant stimuli compared to younger adults, as indicated by the N170 amplitude, however, they were not able to utilize this information in a later task, as was suggested by the recognition rate and LPC amplitude results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Differential Brain Activity in Regions Linked to Visuospatial Processing During Landmark-Based Navigation in Young and Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.552111</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Older adults have difficulties in navigating unfamiliar environments and updating their wayfinding behavior when faced with blocked routes. This decline in navigational capabilities has traditionally been ascribed to memory impairments and dysexecutive function, whereas the impact of visual aging has often been overlooked. The ability to perceive visuospatial information such as salient landmarks is essential to navigating efficiently. To date, the functional and neurobiological factors underpinning landmark processing in aging remain insufficiently characterized. To address this issue, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the brain activity associated with landmark-based navigation in young and healthy older participants. The performances of 25 young adults (μ = 25.4 years, σ = 2.7; seven females) and 17 older adults (μ = 73.0 years, σ = 3.9; 10 females) were assessed in a virtual-navigation task in which they had to orient using salient landmarks. The underlying whole-brain patterns of activity as well as the functional roles of specific cerebral regions involved in landmark processing, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), were analyzed. Older adults’ navigational abilities were overall diminished compared to young adults. Also, the two age groups relied on distinct navigational strategies to solve the task. Better performances during landmark-based navigation were associated with increased neural activity in an extended neural network comprising several cortical and cerebellar regions. Direct comparisons between age groups revealed that young participants had greater anterior temporal activity. Also, only young adults showed significant activity in occipital areas corresponding to the cortical projection of the central visual field during landmark-based navigation. The region-of-interest analysis revealed an increased OPA activation in older adult participants during the landmark condition. There were no significant between-group differences in PPA and RSC activations. These preliminary results hint at the possibility that aging diminishes fine-grained information processing in occipital and temporal regions, thus hindering the capacity to use landmarks adequately for navigation. Keeping sight of its exploratory nature, this work helps towards a better comprehension of the neural dynamics subtending landmark-based navigation and it provides new insights on the impact of age-related visuospatial processing differences on navigation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amplitude of the event-related N1 wave decreases with repeated stimulation. This repetition-attenuation has not previously been investigated in response to variable auditory stimuli, nor has the relative impact of acoustic vs. perceptual category repetition been studied. In the present study, N1 repetition-attenuation was investigated for speech and spectrally rotated speech with varying degrees of acoustic and perceptual category variation. In the speech condition, participants (n = 19) listened to stimulus trains consisting of either the same vowel exemplar (no variability condition), different exemplars of the same vowel (low variability condition), or different exemplars of two different vowels (high variability condition). In the rotated speech condition, the spectrally rotated counterparts of the vowels were presented. Findings show N1 repetition-attenuation in the face of acoustic and perceptual category variability, but no impact of the degree of variability on the degree of N1 attenuation. Speech stimuli resulted in less attenuation than the acoustically matched non-speech stimuli, which is in line with previous findings. It remains unclear if the attenuation of the N1 wave is reduced as a result of stimuli being perceived as belonging to perceptual categories or as a result of some other characteristic of speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pioglitazone Ameliorates Gentamicin Ototoxicity by Affecting the TLR and STAT Pathways in the Early Postnatal Organ of Corti</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise trauma, infection, and ototoxic drugs are frequent external causes of hearing loss. With no pharmacological treatments currently available, understanding the mechanisms and pathways leading to auditory hair cell (HC) damage and repair is crucial for identifying potential pharmacological targets. Prior research has implicated increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation as general mechanisms of hearing loss common to diverse causes. Novel targets of these two key mechanisms of auditory damage may provide new paths toward the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. Pioglitazone, an oral antidiabetic drug from the class of thiazolidinediones, acts as an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) and is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. PPAR-γ is an important player in repressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules. We evaluated the effects of pioglitazone in the mouse Organ of Corti (OC) explants to characterize its influence on signaling pathways involved in auditory HC damage. The OC explants was cultured with pioglitazone, gentamicin, or a combination of both agents. Pioglitazone treatment resulted in significant repression of interferon (IFN)-α and -gamma pathways and downstream cytokines, as assessed by RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR gene expression assays. More detailed investigation at the single gene and protein level showed that pioglitazone mediated its anti-inflammatory effects through alterations of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and STAT pathways. Together, these results indicate that pioglitazone significantly represses IFN and TLR in the cochlea, dampening the activity of gentamicin-induced pathways. These data support our previous results demonstrating significant protection of auditory HCs in the OC explants exposed to pioglitazone and other PPAR-targeted agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Localization of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide Receptor 1 (VPAC1) in Hypothalamic Neuroendocrine Oxytocin Neurons; A Potential Role in Circadian Prolactin Secretion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prolactin (PRL) is a versatile hormone and serves a broad variety of physiological functions besides lactation. The release of PRL from lactotrophs in the pituitary has in rodents been shown to be released with a circadian pattern depending on the physiological state of the animal. The circadian release of PRL seems to be complex involving tonic inhibition by dopamine (DA) neurons on lactotrophs and one or even several releasing factors. Because of the circadian releasing pattern of PRL, neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), “the brain clock,” and especially the neurons expressing neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), have been suggested to be involved in the circadian regulation of PRL. In the present study, we used fluorescence immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization histochemistry, confocal microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction, and highly specific antibodies to visualize the occurrence of VIP receptors 1 and 2 (VPAC1 and VPAC2) in mouse brain hypothalamic sections stained in combination with VIP, oxytocin (OXT), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and DA (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH). We demonstrated that VIP fibers most likely originating from the ventral part of the SCN project to OXT neurons in the magnocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In the PVN, VIP fibers were found in close apposition to OXT neuron exclusively expressing the VPAC1 receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that neither OXT neurons nor TH or AVP neurons were expressing the VPAC2 receptor. VPAC1 receptor expression was also found on blood vessels but not in neurons expressing AVP or TH. These findings suggest that VIP signaling from the SCN does not directly target DA neurons involved in PRL secretion. Furthermore, the findings support the notion that VIP from neurons in the SCN could regulate circadian release of OXT in the posterior pituitary or modulate OXT neurons as a releasing factor involved in the circadian regulation of PRL from pituitary lactotrophs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Related Structures in the Straight Sinus: An Endoscopic Anatomy and Histological Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.573217</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some structure might be encountered with endovascular procedures within the straight sinus and is not now readily seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We investigated the morphological and histological characteristics of the straight sinus, chordae willisii (CW), and junction between the great cerebral vein (GCV) and straight sinus. A total of 22 cadaveric heads and 135 patients were analyzed with either anatomic dissection or neuroimaging. The morphological features of the CW and the junction between the GCV and straight sinus were analyzed by endoscope. The histology of the junction between the GCV and straight sinus was evaluated under the microscope with staining for elastic fiber, Masson’s, and immunohistochemistry. We found that fold, elevation, small bugle, or nodule and CW were detected by endoscope in the straight sinus. The most common type of CW was valve-like lamellae, which comprised 40.46% of all CW. Three different types of junctions between the GCV and straight sinus were identified: type 1 has folds in the GCV and elevation on the floor of the straight sinus; type 2 has folds and a small bugle; and type 3 presents with an intraluminal nodule located at the opening of the GCV. Compared with arachnoid granulation, the nodule consists of smooth muscle fibers and higher rate of elastic fibers. Understanding the detailed anatomy of the straight sinus may help surgeons to avoid procedural difficulties and to achieve higher success rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of Aerobic Exercise, Cognitive and Combined Training on Cognition in Physically Inactive Healthy Late-Middle-Aged Adults: The Projecte Moviment Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.590168</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle interventions are promising strategies to promote cognitive health in aging. Projecte Moviment examines if aerobic exercise (AE), computerized cognitive training (CCT), and their combination (COMB) improves cognition, psychological health, and physical status compared to a control group. We assessed the moderating role of age and sex and the mediating effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), physical activity (PA), and psychological health on intervention-related cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This was a 12-week multi-domain, single-blind, proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT). 96 healthy adults aged 50–70 years were assigned to AE, CCT, COMB, and a wait-list control group. The per protocol sample, which completed the intervention with a level of adherence &amp;gt; 80%, consisted of 82 participants (62% female; age = 58.38 ± 5.47). We assessed cognition, psychological health, CRF, and energy expenditure in PA at baseline and after the intervention. We regressed change in each outcome on the treatment variables, baseline score, sex, age, and education. We used PROCESS Macro to perform the mediation and moderation analyses.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;AE benefited Working Memory (SMD = 0.29, p = 0.037) and Attention (SMD = 0.33, p = 0.028) including the Attention-Speed (SMD = 0.31, p = 0.042) domain, compared to Control. COMB improved Attention (SMD = 0.30, p = 0.043), Speed (SMD = 0.30, p = 0.044), and the Attention-Speed (SMD = 0.30, p = 0.041) domain. CTT group did not show any cognitive change compared to Control. Sportive PA (S-PA) and CRF increased in AE and COMB. Age and sex did not moderate intervention-related cognitive benefits. Change in S-PA, but not in CRF, significantly mediated improvements on Attention-Speed in AE.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A 12-week AE program improved Executive Function and Attention-Speed in healthy late-middle-aged adults. Combining it with CCT did not provide further benefits. Our results add support to the clinical relevance of even short-term AE as an intervention to enhance cognition and highlight the mediating role of change in S-PA in these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03123900.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed at comparing the effects of Tai Chi (a motor-cognitive exercise) with walking (an exercise without cognitive demands) on cognitive performance, brain structure, and brain function in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study included 42 healthy elderly women within two groups: Tai Chi (n = 20; mean age = 62.90 ± 2.38 years) and brisk walking exercise (n = 22; mean age = 63.27 ± 3.58 years). All the participants underwent a cognitive assessment via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and brain structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) assessments.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory in the Tai Chi group was superior to that of the walking group. Higher gray matter density in the inferior and medial temporal regions (including the hippocampus) and higher ReHo in temporal regions (specifically the fusiform gyrus and hippocampus) were found in the Tai Chi group. Significant partial correlations were found between the gray matter density of the left hippocampus and episodic memory in the whole sample. Significant partial correlations were observed between the ReHo in left hippocampus, left parahippocampal, left fusiform, and delayed memory task, which was observed among all subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that long-term Tai Chi practice may improve memory performance via remodeling the structure and function of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Membrane thinning and lateral gating are consistent features of BamA across multiple species</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinchan Liu, James C. Gumbart&lt;/p&gt;

In Gram-negative bacteria, the folding and insertion of β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to the outer membrane are mediated by the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. Two leading models of this process have been put forth: the hybrid barrel model, which claims that a lateral gate in BamA’s β-barrel can serve as a template for incoming OMPs, and the passive model, which claims that a thinned membrane near the lateral gate of BamA accelerates spontaneous OMP insertion. To examine the key elements of these two models, we have carried out 45.5 μs of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of BamA with and without POTRA domains from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus ducreyi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, together with BamA’s homolog, TamA from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, in their native, species-specific outer membranes. In these equilibrium simulations, we consistently observe membrane thinning near the lateral gate for all proteins. We also see occasional spontaneous lateral gate opening and sliding of the β-strands at the gate interface for &lt;i&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, indicating that the gate is dynamic. An additional 14 μs of free-energy calculations shows that the energy necessary to open the lateral gate in BamA/TamA varies by species, but is always lower than the Omp85 homolog, FhaC. Our combined results suggest OMP insertion utilizes aspects of both the hybrid barrel and passive models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ln96zc_HKJI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A data-driven characterisation of natural facial expressions when giving good and bad news</title>

Facial expressions carry key information about an individual’s emotional state. Research into the perception of facial emotions typically employs static images of a small number of artificially posed expressions taken under tightly controlled experimental conditions. However, such approaches risk missing potentially important facial signals and within-person variability in expressions. The extent to which patterns of emotional variance in such images resemble more natural &lt;i&gt;ambient&lt;/i&gt; facial expressions remains unclear. Here we advance a novel protocol for eliciting natural expressions from dynamic faces, using a dimension of emotional valence as a test case. Subjects were video recorded while delivering either positive or negative news to camera, but were not instructed to deliberately or artificially pose any specific expressions or actions. A PCA-based active appearance model was used to capture the key dimensions of facial variance across frames. Linear discriminant analysis distinguished facial change determined by the emotional valence of the message, and this also generalised across subjects. By sampling along the discriminant dimension, and back-projecting into the image space, we extracted a behaviourally interpretable dimension of emotional valence. This dimension highlighted changes commonly represented in traditional face stimuli such as variation in the internal features of the face, but also key postural changes that would typically be controlled away such as a dipping versus raising of the head posture from negative to positive valences. These results highlight the importance of natural patterns of facial behaviour in emotional expressions, and demonstrate the efficacy of using data-driven approaches to study the representation of these cues by the perceptual system. The protocol and model described here could be readily extended to other emotional and non-emotional dimensions of facial variance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F-SNJeJXCiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: NMDA receptors promote hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples and the associated coactivity of CA1 pyramidal cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23276?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23276?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples (SWRs) support the reactivation of memory representations, relaying information to neocortex during “offline” and sleep‐dependent memory consolidation. While blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is known to affect both learning and subsequent consolidation, the specific contributions of NMDAR activation to SWR‐associated activity remain unclear. Here, we combine biophysical modeling with in vivo local field potential (LFP) and unit recording to quantify changes in SWR dynamics following inactivation of NMDAR. In a biophysical model of CA3‐CA1 SWR activity, we find that NMDAR removal leads to reduced SWR density, but spares SWR properties such as duration, cell recruitment and ripple frequency. These predictions are confirmed by experiments in which NMDAR‐mediated transmission in rats was inhibited using three different NMDAR antagonists, while recording dorsal CA1 LFP. In the model, loss of NMDAR‐mediated conductances also induced a reduction in the proportion of cell pairs that co‐activate significantly above chance across multiple events. Again, this prediction is corroborated by dorsal CA1 single‐unit recordings, where the NMDAR blocker ketamine disrupted correlated spiking during SWR. Our results are consistent with a framework in which NMDA receptors both promote activation of SWR events and organize SWR‐associated spiking content. This suggests that, while SWR are short‐lived events emerging in fast excitatory‐inhibitory networks, slower network components including NMDAR‐mediated currents contribute to ripple density and promote consistency in the spiking content across ripples, underpinning mechanisms for fine‐tuning of memory consolidation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Socioeconomic Status Mediates Racial Differences Seen Using the AT(N) Framework</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25948?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25948?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African Americans are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia than non‐Hispanic Whites. In addition to biological considerations (e.g., genetic influences; comorbid disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) Assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences. (2) Considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race differences.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET] structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs‐fc) were collected from African American (n=131) and White (n=685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH] on MRI, blood pressure, body mass index [BMI]) and area‐based socioeconomic status (SES) were included in mediation analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to White participants, African American participants had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (&lt;i&gt;Cohen's f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs‐fc signature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifiable factors such as differences in social contexts and resources, particularly area‐level SES, may contribute to observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mammals, the sensory experience can regulate the development of various brain structures, including the cortex, hippocampus, retina, and olfactory bulb (OB). Odor experience-evoked neural activity drives the development of dendrites on excitatory projection neurons in the OB, such as mitral and tufted cells, as well as inhibitory interneurons. OB interneurons are generated continuously in the subventricular zone and differentiate into granule cells (GCs) and periglomerular cells (PGCs). However, it remains unknown what role each type of OB interneuron plays in controlling olfactory behaviors. Recent studies showed that among the various types of OB interneurons, a subtype of GCs expressing oncofetal trophoblast glycoprotein 5T4 is required for simple odor detection and discrimination behaviors. Mouse 5T4 (also known as Tpbg) is a type I membrane glycoprotein whose extracellular domain contains seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) sandwiched between characteristic LRR-N and LRR-C regions. Recently, it was found that the developmental expression of 5T4 increases dramatically in the retina just before eye-opening. Single-cell transcriptomics further suggests that 5T4 is involved in the development and maintenance of functional synapses in a subset of retinal interneurons, including rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and amacrine cells (ACs). Collectively, 5T4, expressed in interneurons of the OB and retina, plays a key role in sensory processing in the olfactory and visual systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies based on bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing in mice indicate high relevance of microglia with respect to risk genes and neuro-inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we investigated microglia transcriptomes at bulk and single-cell levels in non-demented elderly and AD donors using acute human postmortem cortical brain samples. We identified seven human microglial subpopulations with heterogeneity in gene expression. Notably, gene expression profiles and subcluster composition of microglia did not differ between AD donors and non-demented elderly in bulk RNA sequencing nor in single-cell sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Multimodal Glioma Image Segmentation Using Dual Encoder Structure and Channel Spatial Attention Block</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multimodal medical images provide significant amounts of complementary semantic information. Therefore, multimodal medical imaging has been widely used in the segmentation of gliomas through computational neural networks. However, inputting images from different sources directly to the network does not achieve the best segmentation effect. This paper describes a convolutional neural network called F-S-Net that fuses the information from multimodal medical images and uses the semantic information contained within these images for glioma segmentation. The architecture of F-S-Net is formed by cascading two sub-networks. The first sub-network projects the multimodal medical images into the same semantic space, which ensures they have the same semantic metric. The second sub-network uses a dual encoder structure (DES) and a channel spatial attention block (CSAB) to extract more detailed information and focus on the lesion area. DES and CSAB are integrated into U-Net architectures. A multimodal glioma dataset collected by Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College is used to train and evaluate the network. F-S-Net is found to achieve a dice coefficient of 0.9052 and Jaccard similarity of 0.8280, outperforming several previous segmentation methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Glycine-Histidine-Lysine (GHK) Alleviates Astrocytes Injury of Intracerebral Hemorrhage via the Akt/miR-146a-3p/AQP4 Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major type of cerebrovascular disease with poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that Glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine (GHK) is a kind of natural human tripeptide which could inhibit inflammation and against neurodegenerative diseases, but neither its role nor the mechanisms in ICH have yet been explicit. Currently, we investigated the possible strategies of GHK on ICH injury. Neurological deficit scores, brain water content, Nissl staining, and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) immunohistochemistry were detected in different groups of rats. The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) was examined by real-time PCR. Inflammatory factors were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability and cell proliferation were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), AQP4 expression were detected/assessed using western blot. We observed that 5 and 10 μg/g of GHK improved neurological recovery by significantly reducing brain water content, improving neurological deficits, and promoting neuron survival. Besides, GHK alleviated inflammatory reaction and downregulated AQP4 expression. Furthermore, the effects of GHK on astrocyte were associated with the upregulation of miRNA-146a-3p, which partially regulated the expression of AQP4. Our results demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway participated in the GHK-induced upregulation of miR-146a-3p and miR-146a-3p/AQP4 interaction plays a role in the injury following ICH. These findings suggested that GHK could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Positive Economic, Psychosocial, and Physiological Ecologies Predict Brain Structure and Cognitive Performance in 9–10-Year-Old Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578822</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While low socioeconomic status (SES) introduces risk for developmental outcomes among children, there are an array of proximal processes that determine the ecologies and thus the lived experiences of children. This study examined interrelations between 22 proximal measures in the economic, psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal ecologies of children, in association with brain structure and cognitive performance in a diverse sample of 8,158 9–10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. SES was measured by the income-to-needs ratio (INR), a measure used by federal poverty guidelines. Within the ABCD study, in what is one of the largest and most diverse cohorts of children studied in the United States, we replicate associations of low SES with lower total cortical surface area and worse cognitive performance. Associations between low SES (&amp;lt;200% INR) and measures of development showed the steepest increases with INR, with apparent increases still visible beyond the level of economic disadvantage in the range of 200–400% INR. Notably, we found three latent factors encompassing positive ecologies for children across the areas of economic, psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal well-being in association with better cognitive performance and the higher total cortical surface area beyond the effects of SES. Specifically, latent factors encompassing youth perceived social support and perinatal well-being were positive predictors of developmental measures for all children, regardless of SES. Further, we found a general latent factor that explained relationships between 20 of the proximal measures and encompassed a joint ecology of higher social and economic resources relative to low adversity across psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal domains. The association between the resource-to-adversity latent factor and cognitive performance was moderated by SES, such that for children in higher SES households, cognitive performance progressively increased with these latent factor scores, while for lower SES, cognitive performance increased only among children with the highest latent factor scores. Our findings suggest that both positive ecologies of increased access to resources and lower adversity are mutually critical for promoting better cognitive development in children from low SES households. Our findings inform future studies aiming to examine positive factors that influence healthier development in children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Age as a Mediator of tDCS Effects on Pain: An Integrative Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568306</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique with the potential to decrease pain scores and to improve chronic pain treatment. Although age is an essential factor that might impact the tDCS effect, most studies are solely conducted in adults. Therefore, the age limitation presents a critical research gap in this field and can be shown by only a handful of studies that have included other age groups. To examine the evidence upon the tDCS effect on pain scores on children, adolescents, or elderly, and indirectly, to infer the age-dependent impact on tDCS effects, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic review searching the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Direct using the following search terms adapted according to MeSh or Entree: [(“Adolescent” OR “Children” OR “Elderly”) AND (“tDCS”) AND (“Pain” OR “Pain threshold”) AND (“dorsolateral prefrontal cortex” OR “Motor cortex)] up to April 20th, 2020. We retrieved 228 articles, 13 were included in the systematic review, and five studies with elderly subjects that had their outcomes assessed by pain score or pain threshold were included in the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For the analysis of pain score, 96 individuals received active stimulation, and we found a favorable effect for active tDCS to reduce pain score compared to sham (P = 0.002). The standardized difference was −0.76 (CI 95% = −1.24 to −0.28). For the pain threshold, the analysis showed no significant difference between active and sham tDCS. We reviewed two studies with adolescents: one study using anodal tDCS over the prefrontal cortex reported a reduction in pain scores. However, the second study reported an increase in pain sensitivity for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings suggest tDCS may reduce pain levels in the elderly group. Nevertheless, the small number of studies included in this review—and the considerable heterogeneity for clinical conditions and protocols of stimulation present—limits the support of tDCS use for pain treatment in elderly people. Larger studies on the tDCS effect on pain are needed to be conducted in elderly and adolescents, also evaluating different montages and electrical current intensity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: N-Back Related ERPs Depend on Stimulus Type, Task Structure, Pre-processing, and Lab Factors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The N-Back, a common working memory (WM) updating task, is increasingly used in basic and applied psychological research. As such, an increasing number of electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have sought to identify the electrophysiological signatures of N-Back task performance. However, stimulus type, task structure, pre-processing methods, and differences in the laboratory environment, including the EEG recording setup employed, greatly vary across studies, which in turn may introduce inconsistencies in the obtained results. Here we address this issue by conducting nine different variations of an N-Back task manipulating stimulus type and task structure. Furthermore, we explored the effect of the pre-processing method used and differences in the laboratory environment. Results reveal significant differences in behavioral and electrophysiological signatures in response to N-Back stimulus type, task structure, pre-processing method, and laboratory environment. In conclusion, we suggest that experimental factors, analysis pipeline, and laboratory differences, which are often ignored in the literature, need to be accounted for when interpreting findings and making comparisons across studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Connectome-Based Model Predicts Deep Brain Stimulation Outcome in Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective invasive treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) at present. Due to the invasiveness and cost of operations, a reliable tool is required to predict the outcome of therapy in the clinical decision-making process. This work aims to investigate whether the topological network of functional connectivity states can predict the outcome of DBS without medication. Fifty patients were recruited to extract the features of the brain related to the improvement rate of PD after STN-DBS and to train the machine learning model that can predict the therapy's effect. The functional connectivity analyses suggested that the GBRT model performed best with Pearson's correlations of r = 0.65, p = 2.58E−07 in medication-off condition. The connections between middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) contribute most in the GBRT model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Engrams of Fast Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fast learning designates the behavioral and neuronal mechanisms underlying the acquisition of a long-term memory trace after a unique and brief experience. As such it is opposed to incremental, slower reinforcement or procedural learning requiring repetitive training. This learning process, found in most animal species, exists in a large spectrum of natural behaviors, such as one-shot associative, spatial, or perceptual learning, and is a core principle of human episodic memory. We review here the neuronal and synaptic long-term changes associated with fast learning in mammals and discuss some hypotheses related to their underlying mechanisms. We first describe the variety of behavioral paradigms used to test fast learning memories: those preferentially involve a single and brief (from few hundred milliseconds to few minutes) exposures to salient stimuli, sufficient to trigger a long-lasting memory trace and new adaptive responses. We then focus on neuronal activity patterns observed during fast learning and the emergence of long-term selective responses, before documenting the physiological correlates of fast learning. In the search for the engrams of fast learning, a growing body of evidence highlights long-term changes in gene expression, structural, intrinsic, and synaptic plasticities. Finally, we discuss the potential role of the sparse and bursting nature of neuronal activity observed during the fast learning, especially in the induction plasticity mechanisms leading to the rapid establishment of long-term synaptic modifications. We conclude with more theoretical perspectives on network dynamics that could enable fast learning, with an overview of some theoretical approaches in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Isosteviol Sodium in Murine Brain Capillary Cerebellar Endothelial Cells (cerebEND) After Hypoxia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It damages neurons and other supporting cellular elements in the brain. However, the impairment is not only confined to the region of assault but the surrounding area as well. Besides, it also brings about damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which in turn leads to microvascular failure and edema. Hence, this necessitates an on-going, continuous search for intervention strategies and effective treatment. Of late, the natural sweetener stevioside proved to exhibit neuroprotective effects and therapeutic benefits against cerebral ischemia-induced injury. Its injectable formulation, isosteviol sodium (STVNA) also demonstrated favorable results. Nonetheless, its effects on the BBB have not yet been investigated to date. As such, this present study was designed to assess the effects of STVNA in our in vitro stroke model of the BBB.The integrity and permeability of the BBB are governed and maintained by tight junction proteins (TJPs) such as claudin-5 and occludin. Our data show increased claudin-5 and occludin expression in oxygen and glucose (OGD)-deprived murine brain capillary cerebellar endothelial cells (cerebEND) after STVNa treatment. Likewise, the upregulation of the transmembrane protein integrin-αv was also observed. Finally, cell volume was reduced with the simultaneous administration of STVNA and OGD in cerebEND cells. In neuropathologies such as stroke, the failure of cell volume control is a major feature leading to loss of cells in the penumbra as well as adverse outcomes. Our initial findings, therefore, point to the neuroprotective effects of STVNA at the BBB in vitro, which warrant further investigation for a possible future clinical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: MiR34a Regulates Neuronal MHC Class I Molecules and Promotes Primary Hippocampal Neuron Dendritic Growth and Branching</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573208</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573208</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the immune system, Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are located on the surface of most nucleated cells in vertebrates where they mediate immune responses. Accumulating evidence indicates that MHC-I molecules are also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) where they play important roles that are significantly different from their immune functions. Classical MHC-I molecules are temporally and spatially expressed in the developing and adult CNS, where they participate in the synaptic formation, remodeling and plasticity. Therefore, clarifying the regulation of MHC-I expression is necessary to develop an accurate understanding of its function in the CNS. Here, we show that microRNA 34a (miR34a), a brain enriched noncoding RNA, is temporally expressed in developing hippocampal neurons, and its expression is significantly increased after MHC-I protein abundance is decreased in the hippocampus. Computational algorithms identify putative miR34a target sites in the 3′UTR of MHC-I mRNA, and here we demonstrate direct targeting of miR34a to MHC-I mRNA using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. MiR34a targeting can decrease constitutive MHC-I expression in both Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Finally, miR34a mediated reduction of MHC-I results in increased dendritic growth and branching in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our findings identify miR34a as a novel regulator of MHC-I for shaping neural morphology in developing hippocampal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Does Cholinergic Stimulation Affect the P2X7 Receptor-Mediated Dye Uptake in Mast Cells and Macrophages?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.548376</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.548376</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Extracellular ATP is a powerful trigger of neuroinflammation by activating immune cells via P2X7 receptors. Acetylcholine and nicotinic agonists inhibit ATP-triggered proinflammatory cytokines via the so-called “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” (CAP). However, it remains unclear as to what stage of ATP-induced signaling cholinergic agents provide this anti-inflammatory effect. Using the specific property of P2X7 receptor to open a pathway permeable to large molecules, associated with activation of inflammasome, we studied the action of cholinergic agents on this key event in CAP activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Freshly isolated mouse peritoneal mast cells and primary human macrophages were used. To assess P2X7 channel opening, the permeability to the fluorescent dye YO-PRO1 or ethidium bromide (EtBr) was measured by flow cytometry. Expression of nicotinic receptors was probed in macrophages with the fluorescently labeled α-bungarotoxin or with patch-clamp recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ATP opened P2X7 ion channels in mast cells and macrophages permeable to YO-PRO1 or EtBr, respectively. This stimulatory effect in mast cells was inhibited by the specific P2X7 antagonist A839977 confirming that YO-PRO1 uptake was mediated via ATP-gated P2X7 ion channels. Cholinergic agents also slightly induced dye uptake to mast cells but not in macrophages, which expressed functional α7 nicotinic receptors. However, both in mast cells and in macrophages, acetylcholine and nicotine failed to inhibit the stimulatory effect of ATP on dye uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These data suggest that in immune cells, cholinergic agents do not act on P2X7 receptor-coupled large pore formation but can mediate the anti-inflammatory effect underlying CAP downstream of ATP-driven signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging Impacts the Overall Connectivity Strength of Regions Critical for Information Transfer Among Brain Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated that connector hubs, regions considered critical for the flow of information across neural systems, are mostly involved in neurodegenerative dementia. Considering that aging can significantly affect the brain’s intrinsic connectivity, identifying aging’s impact on these regions’ overall connection strength is important to differentiate changes associated with healthy aging from neurodegenerative disorders. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a carefully selected cohort of 175 healthy volunteers aging from 21 to 86 years old, we computed an intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC) metric, which quantifies a region’s overall connectivity strength, for whole brain, short-range, and long-range connections and examined age-related changes of this metric over the adult lifespan. We have identified a limited number of hub regions with ICC values that showed significant negative relationship with age. These include the medial precentral/midcingulate gyri and insula with both their short-range and long-range (and thus whole-brain) ICC values negatively associated with age, and the angular, middle frontal, and posterior cingulate gyri with their long-range ICC values mainly involved. Seed-based connectivity analyses further confirmed that these regions are connector hubs with connectivity profile that strongly overlapped with multiple large-scale brain networks. General cognitive performance was not associated with these hubs’ ICC values. These findings suggest that even healthy aging could negatively impact the efficiency of regions critical for facilitating information transfer among different functional brain networks. The extent of the regions involved, however, was limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Alterations in Prelimbic Cortical Neuron Arc Expression Vary by Behavioral State and Cortical Layer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortical and medial temporal lobe connectivity is critical for higher cognitive functions that decline in older adults. Likewise, these cortical areas are among the first to show anatomical, functional, and biochemical alterations in advanced age. The prelimbic subregion of the prefrontal cortex and the perirhinal cortex of the medial temporal lobe are densely reciprocally connected and well-characterized as undergoing age-related neurobiological changes that correlate with behavioral impairment. Despite this fact, it remains to be determined how changes within these brain regions manifest as alterations in their functional connectivity. In our previous work, we observed an increased probability of age-related dysfunction for perirhinal cortical neurons that projected to the prefrontal cortex in old rats compared to neurons that were not identified as projection neurons. The current study was designed to investigate the extent to which aged prelimbic cortical neurons also had altered patterns of Arc expression during behavior, and if this was more evident in those cells that had long-range projections to the perirhinal cortex. The expression patterns of the immediate-early gene Arc were quantified in behaviorally characterized rats that also received the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) in the perirhinal cortex to identify projection neurons to this region. As in our previous work, the current study found that CTB+ cells were more active than those that did not have the tracer. Moreover, there were age-related reductions in prelimbic cortical neuron Arc expression that correlated with a reduced ability of aged rats to multitask. Unlike the perirhinal cortex, however, the age-related reduction in Arc expression was equally likely in CTB+ and CTB− negative cells. Thus, the selective vulnerability of neurons with long-range projections to dysfunction in old age may be a unique feature of the perirhinal cortex. Together, these observations identify a mechanism involving prelimbic-perirhinal cortical circuit disruption in cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Phosphodiesterase PDE4D Is Decreased in Frontal Cortex of Aged Rats and Positively Correlated With Working Memory Performance and Inversely Correlated With PKA Phosphorylation of Tau</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age is the largest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and contributes to cognitive impairment in otherwise healthy individuals. Thus, it is critical that we better understand the risk aging presents to vulnerable regions of the brain and carefully design therapeutics to address those effects. In this study we examined age-related changes in cAMP-regulatory protein, phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). Inhibition of PDE4D is currently under investigation as a therapeutic target for AD based on memory-enhancing effects in rodent hippocampus. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of PDE4D in brain regions particularly vulnerable to disease such as the frontal association cortex (FC), where cAMP signaling can impair working memory via opening of potassium channels. We found that PDE4D protein level was decreased in the FC of both moderately and extremely aged rats, and that PDE4D level was correlated with performance on a FC-dependent working memory task. In extremely aged rats, PDE4D was also inversely correlated with levels of phosphorylated tau at serine 214 (S214), a site phosphorylated by protein kinase A. In vitro studies of the PDE4D inhibitor, GEBR-7b, further illustrated that inhibition of PDE4D activity enhanced phosphorylation of tau. pS214-tau phosphorylation is associated with early AD tau pathology, promotes tau dissociation from microtubules and primes subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation at other critical AD-related sites. Age-related loss of PDE4D may thus contribute to the specific vulnerability of the FC to degeneration in AD, and play a critical role in normal cAMP regulation, cautioning against the use of pan-PDE4D inhibitors as therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Connecting Alzheimer’s Disease With Diabetes Mellitus Through Amyloidogenic Evolvability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.576192</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been clearlylinked to oxidative stress and amylin amyloidosis in pancreatic β-cells. Yet despite extensive investigation, the biological significance of this is not fully understood. Recently, we proposed that Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-relevant amyloidogenic proteins (APs), such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, might be involved in evolvability against diverse stressors in the brain. Given the analogous cellular stress environments shared by both T2DM and AD, the objective of this study is to explore T2DM pathogenesis from the viewpoint of amyloidogenic evolvability. Similar to AD-related APs, protofibrillar amylin might confer resistance against the multiple stressors in β-cells and be transmitted to offspring to deliver stress information, in the absence of which, type 1 DM (T1DM) in offspring might develop. On the contrary, T2DM may be manifested through an antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism during parental aging. Such evolvability-associated processes might be affected by parental diabetic conditions, including T1DM and T2DM. Furthermore, the T2DM-mediated increase in AD risk during aging might be attributed to an interaction of amylin with AD-related APs through evolvability, in which amylin protofibrillar formation presumably caused by adiponectin (APN) resistance could increase protofibril formation of AD-related APs in evolvability and subsequently lead to T2DM promotion of AD through antagonistic pleiotropy in aging. This suggests that targeting APN combined with an anti-T2DM agent might be therapeutic against neurodegeneration. Collectively, T1DM and T2DM might be linked through amylin evolvability, and a better understanding of amyloidogenic evolvability might also reveal clues to therapeutic interventions for AD comorbid with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Correlation of Serum BACE1 With Emergence Delirium in Postoperative Patients: A Preliminary Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.555594</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.555594</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The mechanism underlying delirium, a common acute fluctuating mental state, may be related to the activation of a neuroinflammatory response. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether plasma inflammatory response markers, vascular and cerebrovascular injury-related markers, and neurodegeneration-associated markers were associated with emergence delirium (ED).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients aged 50 years or above who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were included in this study. Delirium was assessed postoperatively with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale. Plasma samples were collected from ED patients and non-ED patients to test concentrations of inflammation markers, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA2), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF); vascular and cerebrovascular injury-related markers, including intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1); and neurodegeneration-associated markers, including alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) and β-secretase 1 (BACE1). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between biomarkers and ED, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the diagnostic value of biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 104 patients were included in this study, with an average age of 63.69 ± 7.21. IL-6 (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.66–6.44, P = 0.022), S100B (OR = 4.74, 95% CI: 1.88–11.95, P = 0.001), and BACE1 (OR = 6.54, 95% CI: 2.57–16.65, P &amp;lt; 0.000) were independent biological indicators for the occurrence of ED.CHI3L1, Lp-PLA2, MIF, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and α-Syn were unrelated to ED. Plasma BACE1 level had a possible diagnostic value for ED [area under curve (AUC) = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.66–0.85], whereas plasma IL-6 (AUC = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.51–0.73) and S100B (AUC = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54–0.76) levels had little diagnostic value for distinguishing ED vs. non-ED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Higher levels of systemic inflammation marker IL-6, cerebral inflammation marker S100B, and neurodegeneration-associated marker BACE1 are related to ED. Plasma BACE1 may be a potential diagnostic biomarker for ED.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Modeling flexible behavior in childhood to adulthood shows age-dependent learning mechanisms and less optimal learning in autism in each age group</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daisy Crawley, Lei Zhang, Emily J. H. Jones, Jumana Ahmad, Bethany Oakley, Antonia San José Cáceres, Tony Charman, Jan K. Buitelaar, Declan G. M. Murphy, Christopher Chatham, Hanneke den Ouden, Eva Loth, the EU-AIMS LEAP group &lt;/p&gt;

Flexible behavior is critical for everyday decision-making and has been implicated in restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how flexible behavior changes developmentally in ASD remains largely unknown. Here, we used a developmental approach and examined flexible behavior on a probabilistic reversal learning task in 572 children, adolescents, and adults (ASD &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 321; typical development [TD] &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 251). Using computational modeling, we quantified latent variables that index mechanisms underlying perseveration and feedback sensitivity. We then assessed these variables in relation to diagnosis, developmental stage, core autism symptomatology, and associated psychiatric symptoms. Autistic individuals showed on average more perseveration and less feedback sensitivity than TD individuals, and, across cases and controls, older age groups showed more feedback sensitivity than younger age groups. Computational modeling revealed that dominant learning mechanisms underpinning flexible behavior differed across developmental stages and reduced flexible behavior in ASD was driven by less optimal learning on average within each age group. In autistic children, perseverative errors were positively related to anxiety symptoms, and in autistic adults, perseveration (indexed by both task errors and model parameter estimates) was positively related to RRB. These findings provide novel insights into reduced flexible behavior in relation to clinical symptoms in ASD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S_PJt9wBHoo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Optogenetic Spreading Depression Elicits Trigeminal Pain and Anxiety Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25926?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25926?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (SD) is an intense depolarization underlying migraine aura. Despite the weight of evidence linking SD to the pain phase of migraine, controversy remains over a causal role of SD in cephalgia because of the invasive nature of previous SD induction methods. To overcome this problem, we used a novel minimally invasive optogenetic SD induction method and examined the effect of SD on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic SD was induced as a single event or repeatedly every other day for 2 weeks. End points, including periorbital and hindpaw mechanical allodynia, mouse grimace, anxiety, and working memory, were examined in male and female mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single SD produced bilateral periorbital mechanical allodynia that developed within 1 hour and resolved within 2 days. Sumatriptan prevented periorbital allodynia when administered immediately after SD. Repeated SDs also produced bilateral periorbital allodynia that lasted 4 days and resolved within 2 weeks after the last SD. In contrast, the hindpaw withdrawal thresholds did not change after repeated SDs suggesting that SD‐induced allodynia was limited to the trigeminal region. Moreover, repeated SDs increased mouse grimace scores 2 days after the last SD, whereas a single SD did not. Repeated SDs also increased thigmotaxis scores as a measure of anxiety. In contrast, neither single nor repeated SDs affected visuospatial working memory. We did not detect sexual dimorphism in any end point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these data show a clinically congruent causal relationship among SD, trigeminal pain, and anxiety behavior, possibly reflecting SD modulation of hypothalamic, thalamic, and limbic mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability‐mediated by a reduction in hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (Ih) in hippocampal CA1 neurons in a rat model of traumatic brain injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23270?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with epileptiform activity in the hippocampus; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully determined. The goal was to understand what changes take place in intrinsic neuronal physiology in the hippocampus after blunt force trauma to the cortex. In this context, hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) currents may have a critical role in modulating the neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability; therefore, its contribution to the TBI‐induced hyperexcitability was assessed. In a model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact (CCI), the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons were examined 1 week after TBI induction in rats. Whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings were performed under current‐ and voltage‐clamp conditions following ionotropic receptors blockade. Induction of TBI caused changes in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, as shown by a significant increase and decrease in firing frequency and in the rheobase current, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). The evoked firing rate and the action potential time to peak were also significantly increased and decreased, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). In the TBI group, the amplitude of instantaneous and steady‐state I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; currents was both significantly smaller than those in the control group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). The I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current density was also significantly decreased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). Findings indicated that TBI led to an increase in the intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons and changes in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current could be, in part, one of the underlying mechanisms involved in this hyperexcitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Good, the Bad and the Unknown Aspects of Ghrelin in Stress Coping and Stress-Related Psychiatric Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.594484</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ghrelin is a peptide hormone released by specialized X/A cells in the stomach and activated by acylation. Following its secretion, it binds to ghrelin receptors in the periphery to regulate energy balance, but it also acts on the central nervous system where it induces a potent orexigenic effect. Several types of stressors have been shown to stimulate ghrelin release in rodents, including nutritional stressors like food deprivation, but also physical and psychological stressors such as foot shocks, social defeat, forced immobilization or chronic unpredictable mild stress. The mechanism through which these stressors drive ghrelin release from the stomach lining remains unknown and, to date, the resulting consequences of ghrelin release for stress coping remain poorly understood. Indeed, ghrelin has been proposed to act as a stress hormone that reduces fear, anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rodents but some studies suggest that ghrelin may - in contrast - promote such behaviors. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on the role of the ghrelin system in stress coping. We discuss whether ghrelin release is more than a byproduct of disrupted energy homeostasis following stress exposure. Furthermore, we explore the notion that ghrelin receptor signaling in the brain may have effects independent of circulating ghrelin and in what way this might influence stress coping in rodents. Finally, we examine how the ghrelin system could be utilized as a therapeutic avenue in stress-related psychiatric disorders (with a focus on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders), for example to develop novel biomarkers for a better diagnosis or new interventions to tackle relapse or treatment resistance in patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Predicting Sex From EEG: Validity and Generalizability of Deep-Learning-Based Interpretable Classifier</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Explainable artificial intelligence holds a great promise for neuroscience and plays an important role in the hypothesis generation process. We follow-up a recent machine learning-oriented study that constructed a deep convolutional neural network to automatically identify biological sex from EEG recordings in healthy individuals and highlighted the discriminative role of beta-band power. If generalizing, this finding would be relevant not only theoretically by pointing to some specific neurobiological sexual dimorphisms, but potentially also as a relevant confound in quantitative EEG diagnostic practice. To put this finding to test, we assess whether the automatic identification of biological sex generalizes to another dataset, particularly in the presence of a psychiatric disease, by testing the hypothesis of higher beta power in women compared to men on 134 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. Moreover, we construct ROC curves and compare the performance of the classifiers in determining sex both before and after the antidepressant treatment. We replicate the observation of a significant difference in beta-band power between men and women, providing classification accuracy of nearly 77%. The difference was consistent across the majority of electrodes, however multivariate classification models did not generally improve the performance. Similar results were observed also after the antidepressant treatment (classification accuracy above 70%), further supporting the robustness of the initial finding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Dynamics of Visual Speech Processing and the Role of Orofacial Effectors for Cross-Modal Predictions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain generates predictions about future events. During face-to-face conversations, visemic information is used to predict upcoming auditory input. Recent studies suggest that the speech motor system plays a role in these cross-modal predictions, however, usually only audio-visual paradigms are employed. Here we tested whether speech sounds can be predicted on the basis of visemic information only, and to what extent interfering with orofacial articulatory effectors can affect these predictions. We registered EEG and employed N400 as an index of such predictions. Our results show that N400's amplitude was strongly modulated by visemic salience, coherent with cross-modal speech predictions. Additionally, N400 ceased to be evoked when syllables' visemes were presented backwards, suggesting that predictions occur only when the observed viseme matched an existing articuleme in the observer's speech motor system (i.e., the articulatory neural sequence required to produce a particular phoneme/viseme). Importantly, we found that interfering with the motor articulatory system strongly disrupted cross-modal predictions. We also observed a late P1000 that was evoked only for syllable-related visual stimuli, but whose amplitude was not modulated by interfering with the motor system. The present study provides further evidence of the importance of the speech production system for speech sounds predictions based on visemic information at the pre-lexical level. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of a hypothesized trimodal repertoire for speech, in which speech perception is conceived as a highly interactive process that involves not only your ears but also your eyes, lips and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pre-clinical and Clinical Implications of “Inside-Out” vs. “Outside-In” Paradigms in Multiple Sclerosis Etiopathogenesis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder, characterized by central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. Although autoimmunity, inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration underlie MS, the initiating event has yet to be clarified. Effective disease modifying therapies need to both regulate the immune system and promote restoration of neuronal function, including remyelination. The challenge in developing an effective long-lived therapy for MS requires that three disease-associated targets be addressed: (1) self-tolerance must be re-established to specifically inhibit the underlying myelin-directed autoimmune pathogenic mechanisms; (2) neurons must be protected from inflammatory injury and degeneration; (3) myelin repair must be engendered by stimulating oligodendrocyte progenitors to remyelinate CNS neuronal axons. The combined use of chronic and relapsing remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (C-EAE, R-EAE) (“outside-in”) as well as progressive diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA) and cuprizone autoimmune encephalitis (CAE) (“inside-out”) mouse models allow for the investigation and specific targeting of all three of these MS-associated disease parameters. The “outside-in” EAE models initiated by myelin-specific autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells allow for the evaluation of both myelin-specific tolerance in the absence or presence of neuroprotective and/or remyelinating agents. The “inside-out” mouse models of secondary inflammatory demyelination are triggered by toxin-induced oligodendrocyte loss or subtle myelin damage, which allows evaluation of novel therapeutics that could promote remyelination and neuroprotection in the CNS. Overall, utilizing these complementary pre-clinical MS models will open new avenues for developing therapeutic interventions, tackling MS from the “outside-in” and/or “inside-out”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Sequence heterochrony led to a gain of functionality in an immature stage of the central complex: A fly–beetle insight</title>

Animal behavior is guided by the brain. Therefore, adaptations of brain structure and function are essential for animal survival, and each species differs in such adaptations. The brain of one individual may even differ between life stages, for instance, as adaptation to the divergent needs of larval and adult life of holometabolous insects. All such differences emerge during development, but the cellular mechanisms behind the diversification of brains between taxa and life stages remain enigmatic. In this study, we investigated holometabolous insects in which larvae differ dramatically from the adult in both behavior and morphology. As a consequence, the central complex, mainly responsible for spatial orientation, is conserved between species at the adult stage but differs between larvae and adults of one species as well as between larvae of different taxa. We used genome editing and established transgenic lines to visualize cells expressing the conserved transcription factor &lt;i&gt;retinal homeobox&lt;/i&gt;, thereby marking homologous &lt;i&gt;genetic neural lineages&lt;/i&gt; in both the fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and the beetle &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;. This approach allowed us for the first time to compare the development of homologous neural cells between taxa from embryo to the adult. We found complex heterochronic changes including shifts of developmental events between embryonic and pupal stages. Further, we provide, to our knowledge, the first example of &lt;i&gt;sequence heterochrony&lt;/i&gt; in brain development, where certain developmental steps changed their position within the ontogenetic progression. We show that through this &lt;i&gt;sequence heterochrony&lt;/i&gt;, an immature developmental stage of the central complex gains functionality in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; larvae.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ULqRbBSGh1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for significant global health burden. Effects of TBI can become chronic even following mild injury. There is a need to develop effective therapies to attenuate the damaging effects of TBI and improve recovery outcomes. This literature review using a priori criteria (PROSPERO; CRD42018100623) summarized 43 studies between January 1998 and July 2019 that investigated nutritional interventions (NUT) delivered with the objective of altering neurophysiological (NP) outcomes following TBI. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies, and NP outcomes recorded. The systematic search resulted in 43 of 3,748 identified studies met inclusion criteria. No studies evaluated the effect of a NUT on NP outcomes of TBI in humans. Biomarkers of morphological changes and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission were the most evaluated NP outcomes across the 43 studies that used 2,897 animals. The risk of bias was unclear in all reviewed studies due to poorly detailed methodology sections. Taking these limitations into account, anti‐oxidants, branched chain amino acids, and ω‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown the most promising pre‐clinical results for altering NP outcomes following TBI. Refinement of pre‐clinical methodologies used to evaluate effects of interventions on secondary damage of TBI would improve the likelihood of translation to clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in neuronal terminals of IIH

The mitochondria–ER contact sites distances are reduced in IIH

The postsynaptic density length is reduced in IIH




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) primarily affects fertile, overweight women, and presents with the symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The etiology is unknown but has been thought to relate to cerebrospinal fluid disturbance or cerebral venous stenosis. We have previously found evidence that IIH is also a disease of the brain parenchyma, evidenced by alterations at the neurogliovascular interface, including astrogliosis, pathological changes in the basement membrane and pericytes, and alterations of perivascular aquaporin‐4. The aim of this present electron microscopic study was to examine whether mitochondria phenotype was changed in IIH, particularly focusing on perivascular astrocytic endfeet and neurons (soma and pre‐ and postsynaptic terminals). Cortical brain biopsies of nine reference individuals and eight IIH patients were analyzed for subcellular distribution and phenotypical features of mitochondria using transmission electron microscopy. We found significantly increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria and reduced number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of IIH patients. The degree of astrogliosis correlated negatively with the number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfoot processes. Moreover, we found significantly increased number of pathological mitochondria in pre‐ and postsynaptic neuronal terminals, as well as significantly shortened distance between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum contacts. Finally, the length of postsynaptic density, a marker of synaptic strength, was on average reduced in IIH. The present data provide evidence of pathological mitochondria in perivascular astrocytes endfeet and neurons of IIH patients, highlighting that impaired metabolism at the neurogliovascular interface may be a facet of IIH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The projections of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs to retinorecipient brain nuclei</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The projections of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs to retinorecipient brain nuclei&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53c5ba34-b45f-4ce3-bcaa-f36cfc71d2e4/cne25061-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy reveals that many retinorecipient brain regions associated with non‐image forming vision are innervated by retinal projections from both image and non‐image forming retinal ganglion cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina, allow us to perceive our visual environment. RGCs respond to rod/cone input through the retinal circuitry, however, a small population of RGCs are in addition intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and project to unique targets in the brain to modulate a broad range of subconscious visual behaviors such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. Despite the discovery of ipRGCs nearly two decades ago, there is still little information about how or if conventional RGCs (non‐ipRGCs) target ipRGC‐recipient nuclei to influence subconscious visual behavior. Using a dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy, we showed that conventional RGCs innervate many subconscious ipRGC‐recipient nuclei, apart from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We revealed previously unrecognized stratification patterns of retinal innervation from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs in the ventral portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, we found that the percent innervation of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs across ipsi‐ and contralateral nuclei differ. Our data provide a blueprint to understand how conventional RGCs and ipRGCs innervate different brain regions to influence subconscious visual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Evolutionary and homeostatic changes in morphology of visual dendrites of Mauthner cells in Astyanax blind cavefish&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7933c36e-d578-40c7-9be6-54c335523061/cne25056-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development and evolution influence the size and branching of visually targeted Mauthner cell dendrites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauthner cells are the largest neurons in the hindbrain of teleost fish and most amphibians. Each cell has two major dendrites thought to receive segregated streams of sensory input: the lateral dendrite receives mechanosensory input while the ventral dendrite receives visual input. These inputs, which mediate escape responses to sudden stimuli, may be modulated by the availability of sensory information to the animal. To understand the impact of the absence of visual information on the morphologies of Mauthner cells during developmental and evolutionary time scales, we examined the teleost &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt;. This species of tetra is found in two morphs: a seeing surface fish and a blind cavefish. We compared the structure of Mauthner cells in surface fish raised under daily light conditions, in surface fish raised in constant darkness, and in two independent lineages of cave populations. The length of ventral dendrites of Mauthner cells in dark‐raised surface fish larvae were longer and more branched, while in both cave morphs the ventral dendrites were smaller or absent. The absence of visual input in surface fish with normal eye development leads to a homeostatic increase in dendrite size, whereas over evolution, the absence of light led to the loss of eyes and a reduction in dendrite size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Epinephrine May Contribute to the Persistence of Traumatic Memories in a Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Animal Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The importance of catecholamines in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) still needs to be explored. We aimed to evaluate epinephrine’s (EPI) causal role and molecular mechanism for the persistence of PTSD traumatic memories. Wild-type (WT) and EPI-deficient mice (phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-knockout mice, Pnmt-KO) were induced with PTSD and behavioral tests were performed. Some Pnmt-KO mice were administered with EPI or vehicle. Catecholamines were quantified by HPLC-ED. Nr4a1, Nr4a2, and Nr4a3 mRNA expression were evaluated by real-time PCR in hippocampus samples. It was observed an increase in EPI and freezing behavior, and a decrease in open arm entries in the elevated plus-maze test and time spent in the light in the light–dark test in WT mice in the PTSD-induction group compared to control. After induction of PTSD, Pnmt-KO mice showed a decrease in freezing, as well as an increase in open arm entries and transitions between compartments compared to WT. After PTSD induction, Pnmt-KO mice administered with EPI showed an increase in freezing compared with the vehicle. On day 0 of PTSD induction, it was observed an increase in mRNA expression of Nr4a2 and Nr4a3 genes in the hippocampus of WT mice compared to control, contrary to Pnmt-KO mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that EPI may be involved in the persistence of traumatic memories in PTSD, possibly through enhancement of the expression of Nr4a2 and Nr4a3 genes in the hippocampus. Peripheral administration of EPI restored contextual traumatic memories in Pnmt-KO mice, which suggests a causal role for EPI. The persistence of contextual traumatic memories may contribute to anxiety-like behavior and resistance of traumatic memory extinction in this PTSD mice model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Lack of Desmin in Mice Causes Structural and Functional Disorders of Neuromuscular Junctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567084</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567084</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Desmin, the major intermediate filament (IF) protein in muscle cells, interlinks neighboring myofibrils and connects the whole myofibrillar apparatus to myonuclei, mitochondria, and the sarcolemma. However, desmin is also known to be enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The pivotal role of the desmin IF cytoskeletal network is underscored by the fact that over 120 mutations of the human DES gene cause hereditary and sporadic myopathies and cardiomyopathies. A subgroup of human desminopathies comprises autosomal recessive cases resulting in the complete abolition of desmin protein. In these patients, who display a more severe phenotype than the autosomal dominant cases, it has been reported that some individuals also suffer from a myasthenic syndrome in addition to the classical occurrence of myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Since further studies on the NMJ pathology are hampered by the lack of available human striated muscle biopsy specimens, we exploited homozygous desmin knock-out mice which closely mirror the striated muscle pathology of human patients lacking desmin protein. Here, we report on the impact of the lack of desmin on the structure and function of NMJs and the transcription of genes coding for postsynaptic proteins. Desmin knock-out mice display a fragmentation of NMJs in soleus, but not in the extensor digitorum longus muscle. Moreover, soleus muscle fibers show larger NMJs. Further, transcription levels of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) genes are increased in muscles from desmin knock-out mice, especially of the AChRγ subunit, which is known as a marker of muscle fiber regeneration. Electrophysiological recordings depicted a pathological decrement of nerve-dependent endplate potentials and an increased rise time of the nerve-independent miniature endplate potentials. The latter appears related to the fragmentation of NMJs in desmin knockout mice. Our study highlights the essential role of desmin for the structural and functional integrity of mammalian NMJs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Walking impairments represent one of the most debilitating symptom areas for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is important to detect even slightest walking impairments in order to start and optimize necessary interventions in time to counteract further progression of the disability. For this reason, a regular monitoring through gait analysis is highly necessary. At advanced stages of MS with significant walking impairment, this assessment is also necessary to optimize symptomatic treatment, choose the most suitable walking aid and plan individualized rehabilitation. In clinical practice, walking impairment is only assessed at higher levels of the disease using e.g., the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In contrast to the EDSS, standardized functional tests such as walking speed, walking endurance and balance as well as walking quality and gait-related patient-reported outcomes allow a more holistic and sensitive assessment of walking impairment. In recent years, the MS Center Dresden has established a standardized monitoring procedure for the routine multidimensional assessment of gait and balance disorders. In the following protocol, we present the techniques and procedures for the analysis of gait and balance of people with MS at the MS Center Dresden. Patients are assessed with a multidimensional gait analysis at least once a year. This enables long-term monitoring of walking impairment, which allows early active intervention regarding further progression of disease and improves the current standard clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interest in excitotoxicity expanded following its implication in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury in the 1980s, but waned subsequent to the failure of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists in high profile clinical stroke trials. Nonetheless there has been steady progress in elucidating underlying mechanisms. This review will outline the historical path to current understandings of excitotoxicity in the ischemic brain, and suggest that this knowledge should be leveraged now to develop neuroprotective treatments for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Collagen Nanoparticle-Mediated Brain Silymarin Delivery: An Approach for Treating Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion-Induced Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.538404</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Silymarin is a bioactive constituent isolated from milk thistle (Silybum marinum). Since its discovery, silymarin has been considered a gold standard drug in treating ailments related to the liver, resulting from alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis. This hepatoprotective nature of silymarin arises out of antioxidative and tissue-regenerating properties of silymarin. However, several recent studies have established the neuroprotective link of silymarin, too. Thus, the current investigation was aimed at exploring the neuroprotective effect of nanosilymarin (silymarin encapsulated inside collagen-based polymeric nanoparticulate drug delivery system). The study aimed at bringing out the role of nanoparticles in enhancing the therapeutic effect of silymarin against neuronal injury, originating out of oxidative-stress-related brain damages in focal cerebral ischemia. Collagen-based micellar nanoparticles were prepared and stabilized using 3-ethyl carbodiimide-hydrochloride (EDC-Hcl) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as crosslinkers. Nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy techniques, and the size of nanoparticles was found to be around 48 nm. Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with three different doses of nanosilymarin of 10, 100, and 1,000 μg/kg b.wt and a dose of free silymarin of 100 mg/kg b.wt intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 7 days. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model on the eighth day for 1 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. The animals were then evaluated for neurobehavioral, infarct analysis, biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies. All the above parameters showed remarkable improvement in nanosilymarin-treated groups in comparison to the silymarin-treated group. Nanoparticle encapsulation of drug enhanced neuroprotection by increasing drug bioavailability and targeting. Thus, the present study concluded with satisfactory results, showing the critical role played by nanoparticles in improving the neuroprotection at very low drug doses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Beyond Pairwise Interactions: The Totally Antisymmetric Part of the Bispectrum as Coupling Measure of at Least Three Interacting Sources</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.573750</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.573750</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we make two contributions to the analysis of brain oscillations with CFC techniques. First, we introduce a new bispectral CFC measure which is selective to couplings between three or more brain sources. This measure can be derived from ordinary cross-bispectra by performing a total-antisymmetrization operation on them. Significant coupling values can then be attributed to at least three interacting signals. This selectivity to the number of sources can be helpful to test hypotheses on the number of brain sources involved in the generation of commonly observed brain oscillations, such as the alpha rhythm. In a second step we present the correct empirical distribution for the coupling measure, which is necessary to properly assess the significance of coupling results. More importantly however, this corrected statistic is not limited to our particular measure, but holds for all complex-valued coupling estimators. We illustrate how the very common misassumption of empirical normality of such estimators can lead to a systematic underestimation of p-values, the breakdown of multiple comparison control procedures and in consequence a drastic inflation of the number of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Relationship Between Attention Bias and Psychological Index in Individuals With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Preliminary Event-Related Potential Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561726</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561726</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Attention bias towards pain-related information exists in patients with chronic pain, and recently, attention bias modification (ABM) training has been administered to patients with chronic pain. In this study, we conducted an attention bias modification task in conjunction with event-related potential measurements for individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP) and investigated the relationship between attention bias and psychological assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eleven women and two men with chronic LBP participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The Japanese version of the STarT Back Screening Tool (J-SBST) total score was significantly correlated with the N1 amplitude of Cz. The J-SBST psychological score was significantly correlated with the N1 amplitude of Cz and with reaction time (RT). The Japanese version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Japanese version of the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) scores were significantly correlated with the P2 amplitude at Fz (only PCS), Cz, and Pz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that J-SBST, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of psychological factors, PCN with measuring of catastrophizing in the context of actual or anticipated pain, and BDI-II, can likely help identify chronic LBP patients with attention bias. For chronic LBP patients who are classified according to J-SBST or PCN pain-related outcome improvement with ABM training can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: White Matter Neuroplasticity: Motor Learning Activates the Internal Capsule and Reduces Hemodynamic Response Variability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509258</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have noted the importance of white matter changes in motor learning, but existing literature only focuses on structural and microstructural MRI changes, as there are limited tools available for in vivo investigations of white matter function. One method that has gained recent prominence is the application of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI to white matter, with high-field scanners now being able to better detect the smaller hemodynamic changes present in this tissue type compared to those in the gray matter. However, fMRI techniques have yet to be applied to investigations of neuroplastic change with motor learning in white matter. White matter function represents an unexplored component of neuroplasticity and is essential for gaining a complete understanding of learning-based changes occurring throughout the whole brain. Twelve healthy, right-handed participants completed fine motor and gross motor tasks with both hands, using an MRI compatible computer mouse. Using a crossover design along with a prior analysis approach to establish WM activation, participants received a baseline scan followed by 2 weeks of training, returning for a midpoint and endpoint scan. The motor tasks were designed to be selectively difficult for the left hand, leading to a training effect only in that condition. Analysis targeted the comparison and detection of training-associated right vs left hand changes. A statistically significant improvement in motor task score was only noted for the left-hand motor condition. A corresponding change in the temporal characteristics of the white matter hemodynamic response was shown within only the right corticospinal tract. The hemodynamic response exhibited a reduction in the dispersion characteristics after the training period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MRI detectable functional neuroplasticity in white matter, suggesting that modifications in temporal characteristics of white matter hemodynamics may underlie functional neuroplasticity in this tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Stimulation Induces Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials of Inferior Colliculus Neurons in a Frequency-Specific Manner</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticofugal modulation of auditory responses in subcortical nuclei has been extensively studied whereas corticofugal synaptic transmission must still be characterized. This study examined postsynaptic potentials of the corticocollicular system, i.e., the projections from the primary auditory cortex (AI) to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICc) of the midbrain, in anesthetized C57 mice. We used focal electrical stimulation at the microampere level to activate the AI (ES&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt;) and in vivo whole-cell current-clamp to record the membrane potentials of ICc neurons. Following the whole-cell patch-clamp recording of 88 ICc neurons, 42 ICc neurons showed ES&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt;-evoked changes in the membrane potentials. We found that the ES&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt; induced inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in 6 out of 42 ICc neurons but only when the stimulus current was 96 μA or higher. In the remaining 36 ICc neurons, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were induced at a much lower stimulus current. The 36 ICc neurons exhibiting EPSPs were categorized into physiologically matched neurons (n = 12) when the characteristic frequencies of the stimulated AI and recorded ICc neurons were similar (≤1 kHz) and unmatched neurons (n = 24) when they were different (&amp;gt;1 kHz). Compared to unmatched neurons, matched neurons exhibited a significantly lower threshold of evoking noticeable EPSP, greater EPSP amplitude, and shorter EPSP latency. Our data allow us to propose that corticocollicular synaptic transmission is primarily excitatory and that synaptic efficacy is dependent on the relationship of the frequency tunings between AI and ICc neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Adaptive Surround Modulation of MT Neurons: A Computational Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.529345</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.529345</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The classical receptive field (CRF) of a spiking visual neuron is defined as the region in the visual field that can generate spikes when stimulated by a visual stimulus. Many visual neurons also have an extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) that surrounds the CRF. The presence of a stimulus in the ECRF does not generate spikes but rather modulates the response to a stimulus in the neuron's CRF. Neurons in the primate Middle Temporal (MT) area, which is a motion specialist region, can have directionally antagonistic or facilitatory surrounds. The surround's effect switches between directionally antagonistic or facilitatory based on the characteristics of the stimulus, with antagonistic effects when there are directional discontinuities but facilitatory effects when there is directional coherence. Here, we present a computational model of neurons in area MT that replicates this observation and uses computational building blocks that correlate with observed cell types in the visual pathways to explain the mechanism of this modulatory effect. The model shows that the categorization of MT neurons based on the effect of their surround depends on the input stimulus rather than being a property of the neurons. Also, in agreement with neurophysiological findings, the ECRFs of the modeled MT neurons alter their center-surround interactions depending on image contrast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Projection From the Premotor or Primary Motor Cortex to the Subthalamic Nucleus in Intact and Parkinsonian Adult Macaque Monkeys: A Pilot Tracing Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Besides the main cortical inputs to the basal ganglia, via the corticostriatal projection, there is another input via the corticosubthalamic projection (CSTP), terminating in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The present study investigated and compared the CSTPs originating from the premotor cortex (PM) or the primary motor cortex (M1) in two groups of adult macaque monkeys. The first group includes six intact monkeys, whereas the second group was made up of four monkeys subjected to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication producing Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like symptoms and subsequently treated with an autologous neural cell ecosystem (ANCE) therapy. The CSTPs were labeled with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), injected either in PM or in M1. BDA-labeled axonal terminal boutons in STN were charted, counted, and then normalized based on the number of labeled corticospinal axons in each monkey. In intact monkeys, the CSTP from PM was denser than that originating from M1. In two PD monkeys, the CSTP originating from PM or M1 were substantially increased, as compared to intact monkeys. In one other PD monkey, there was no obvious change, whereas the last PD monkey showed a decrease of the CSTP originating from M1. Interestingly, the linear relationship between CSTP density and PD symptoms yielded a possible dependence of the CSTP re-organization with the severity of the MPTP lesion. The higher the PD symptoms, the larger the CSTP densities, irrespective of the origin (from both M1 or PM). Plasticity of the CSTP in PD monkeys may be related to PD itself and/or to the ANCE treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Gender inequality in academia: Problems and solutions for women faculty in STEM</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24631?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24631?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there is widespread interest in women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, progress toward gender equality in these fields is slow. More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender‐biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., “geeky” décor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation‐funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24744?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/879cf2dc-4be0-4abe-aab9-2b1b1d01c269/jnr24744-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse cochlear glial cells have region‐specific membrane properties. Within dissociated cultures, satellite glial cells (SGCs) have large weak inwardly rectifying currents, likely mediated by Kir4.1 channels. Presumptive Schwann cells lack these currents. Soon after birth, Kir4.1 subunits appear in both glial subtypes, but become restricted to SGCs around hearing onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the primary afferent neurons of the auditory system, and together with their attendant glia, form the auditory nerve. Within the cochlea, satellite glial cells (SGCs) encapsulate the cell body of SGNs, whereas Schwann cells (SCs) wrap their peripherally‐ and centrally‐directed neurites. Despite their likely importance in auditory nerve function and homeostasis, the physiological properties of auditory glial cells have evaded description. Here, we characterized the voltage‐activated membrane currents of glial cells from the mouse cochlea. We identified a prominent weak inwardly rectifying current in SGCs within cochlear slice preparations (postnatal day P5‐P6), which was also present in presumptive SGCs within dissociated cultures prepared from the cochleae of hearing mice (P14‐P15). Pharmacological block by Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and desipramine suggested that channels belonging to the Kir4 family mediated the weak inwardly rectifying current, and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; immunofluorescence implicated the involvement of Kir4.1 subunits. Additional electrophysiological profiles were identified for glial cells within dissociated cultures, suggesting that glial subtypes may have specific membrane properties to support distinct physiological roles. Immunofluorescence using fixed cochlear sections revealed that although Kir4.1 is restricted to SGCs after the onset of hearing, these channels are more widely distributed within the glial population earlier in postnatal development (i.e., within both SGCs and SCs). The decrease in Kir4.1 immunofluorescence during SC maturation was coincident with a reduction of Sox2 expression and advancing neurite myelination. The data suggest a diversification of glial properties occurs in preparation for sound‐driven activity in the auditory nerve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dynamics of perineuronal nets over amphibian metamorphosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a9886c2-2c89-4792-8061-5ce5b17ef5c6/cne25055-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a dramatic, brain‐wide reorganization of perineuronal nets (PNNs) during metamorphosis in an anuran amphibian. A sharp reduction of PNNs precedes the overhaul of amphibian morphology and neural circuitry that transitions the animal from an aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle. In mammals, PNNs regulate neuronal plasticity and maturation. Results suggest PNN temporal dynamics are important to understanding their role in neural development, learning, and memory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix materials known as perineuronal nets (PNNs) have been shown to have remarkable consequences for the maturation of neural circuits and stabilization of behavior. It has been proposed that, due to the possibly long‐lived biochemical nature of their components, PNNs may be an important substrate by which long‐term memories are stored in the central nervous system. However, little empirical evidence exists that shows that PNNs are themselves stable once established. Thus, the question of their temporal dynamics remains unresolved. We leverage the dramatic morphological and behavioral transformations that occur during amphibian metamorphosis to show that PNNs can be highly dynamic in nature. We used established lectin histochemistry to show that PNNs undergo drastic reconstruction during the metamorphic transition. Pre‐metamorphic tadpoles have abundant lectin‐labeled pericellular material, which we interpret to be PNNs, surrounding neurons throughout the central nervous system. During the metamorphic transition, these structures degrade, and begin to reform in the months following metamorphosis. We show that PNN sizes and staining intensity further change over metamorphosis, suggesting compositional rearrangement. We found PNNs in brain regions with putative homology to regions in mammals with known PNN function, and in other shared regions where PNN function is unknown. Our results suggest that PNNs are susceptible to remodeling by endogenous mechanisms during development. Interpreting the roles of PNNs in circuit maturation and stability requires understanding their temporal relationship with the neurons and synapses they surround. Our work provides further impetus to investigate this relationship in tandem with developmental and behavioral studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal spatial memory representations in mice are heterogeneously stable</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23272?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population of hippocampal neurons actively coding space continually changes across days as mice repeatedly perform tasks. Many hippocampal place cells become inactive while other previously silent neurons become active, challenging the idea that stable behaviors and memory representations are supported by stable patterns of neural activity. Active cell replacement may disambiguate unique episodes that contain overlapping memory cues, and could contribute to reorganization of memory representations. How active cell replacement affects the evolution of representations of different behaviors within a single task is unknown. We trained mice to perform a delayed nonmatching to place task over multiple weeks, and performed calcium imaging in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus using head‐mounted miniature microscopes. Cells active on the central stem of the maze “split” their calcium activity according to the animal's upcoming turn direction (left or right), the current task phase (study or test), or both task dimensions, even while spatial cues remained unchanged. We found that, among reliably active cells, different splitter neuron populations were replaced at unequal rates, resulting in an increasing number of cells modulated by turn direction and a decreasing number of cells with combined modulation by both turn direction and task phase. Despite continual reorganization, the ensemble code stably segregated these task dimensions. These results show that hippocampal memories can heterogeneously reorganize even while behavior is unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Selective neuromodulation and mutual inhibition within the CA3–CA2 system can prioritize sequences for replay</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make optimal use of previous experiences, important neural activity sequences must be prioritized during hippocampal replay. Integrating insights about the interplay between CA3 and CA2, we propose a conceptual framework that allows the two regions to control which sequences are reactivated. We suggest that neuromodulatory‐gated plasticity and mutual inhibition enable discrete assembly sequences in both regions to support each other while suppressing competing sequences. This perspective provides a coherent interpretation for a variety of seemingly disconnected functional properties of CA2 and paves the way for a more general understanding of CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The ratio of posterior–anterior medial temporal lobe volumes predicts source memory performance in healthy young adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functional gradient has been proposed across the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such that the anterior MTL is thought to support processing of individual items (e.g., item memory and complex object perception), whereas the posterior MTL is thought to support item‐context retrieval (e.g., source memory). Whereas functional imaging studies have provided evidence supporting this anatomical organization, results from structural analyses remain inconclusive. The current study examined the relationship between volume of MTL regions of interest (ROIs), and performance on a source memory task and a fine‐grain complex object perception task, in healthy young adults (mean age = 21.5, range = 18–29). Using a semiautomated procedure, we segmented the parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices (PHC, PRC), posteromedial and anterolateral entorhinal cortices (pmERC, alERC), and posterior and anterior hippocampus (postHC, antHC) on high‐resolution T2‐weighted MRIs. Regional volumes were computed as proportions of intracranial volume, and as posterior–anterior volumetric ratios (PHC:PRC, pmERC:alERC, postHC:antHC). Partial‐least squares regressions were applied to predict source and item memory, and perceptual discrimination accuracy, based on ROI and ratio volumes. In our ROI regressions, we found that postHC volume was positively correlated with a latent factor predicting source memory, and PRC and antHC volumes were negatively correlated to this latent factor. In our ratio regressions, we observed an effect relating the posterior–anterior distribution of gray matter across the MTL with source memory. Our results demonstrate differential associations between anterior and posterior MTL and source memory performance. Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering patterns of structure–behavior associations in the neurobiology of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Spatial encoding in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is related during deliberation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23250?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23250?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberation is thought to involve the internal simulation of the outcomes of candidate actions, the valuation of those outcomes, and the selection of the actions with the highest expected value. While it is known that deliberation involves prefrontal cortical areas, specifically the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well as the hippocampus (HPC) and other brain regions, how these areas process prospective information and select actions is not well understood. We recorded simultaneously from ensembles in dmPFC and CA1 of dorsal HPC in rats during performance of a spatial contingency switching task, and examined the relationships between spatial and reward encoding in these two areas during deliberation at the choice point. We found that CA1 and dmPFC represented either goal locations or the current position simultaneously, but that when goal locations were encoded, HPC and dmPFC did not always represent the same goal location. Ensemble activity in dmPFC predicted when HPC would represent goal locations, but on a broad timescale on the order of seconds. Also, reward encoding in dmPFC increased during hippocampal theta cycles where CA1 ensembles represented the goal location. These results suggest that dmPFC and HPC share prospective information during deliberation, that dmPFC may influence whether HPC represents prospective information, and that information recalled about goal locations by HPC may be integrated into dmPFC reward representations on fast timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Optogenetic “low‐theta” pacing of the septohippocampal circuit is sufficient for spatial goal finding and is influenced by behavioral state and cognitive demand</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23248?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal theta oscillations show prominent changes in frequency and amplitude depending on behavioral state or cognitive demands. How these dynamic changes in theta oscillations contribute to the spatial and temporal organization of hippocampal cells, and ultimately behavior, remain unclear. We used low‐theta frequency optogenetic stimulation to pace coordination of cellular and network activity between the medial septum (MS) and hippocampus during baseline and MS stimulation while rats were at rest or performing a spatial accuracy task with a visible or hidden goal zone. Hippocampal receptivity to pan‐neuronal septal stimulation at low‐theta frequency was primarily determined by speed and secondarily by task demands. Competition between artificial and endogenous field potentials at theta frequency attenuated hippocampal phase preference relative to local theta, but the spike‐timing activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells was effectively driven by artificial septal output, particularly during the hidden goal task. Notwithstanding temporal reorganization by artificial theta stimulation, place field properties were unchanged and alterations to spatial behavior were limited to goal zone approximation. Our results indicate that even a low‐theta frequency timing signal in the septohippocampal circuit is sufficient for spatial goal finding behavior. The results also advance a mechanistic understanding of how endogenous or artificial somatodendritic timing signals relate to displacement computations during navigation and spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neur1 and Neur2 are required for hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23247?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt;, mouse homologs of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila neur&lt;/i&gt; gene, consist of two neuralized homology repeat domains and a RING domain. Both &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; are expressed in the whole adult brain and encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathways. A previous study reported that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; enhances hippocampus‐dependent memory, whereas the role of &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the respective roles of &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; in hippocampus‐dependent memory using three lines of genetically modified mice: &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, and &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; double knock‐out (D‐KO). Our results showed that spatial memory was impaired when both &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; were deleted, but not in the individual knock‐out of either &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, basal synaptic properties estimated by input–output relationships and paired‐pulse facilitation did not change, but a form of long‐term potentiation that requires protein synthesis was specifically impaired in the D‐KO mice. These results collectively suggest that &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; are crucially involved in hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Tonic GABA‐activated synaptic and extrasynaptic currents in dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons along the mouse hippocampal dorsoventral axis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23245?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure in the brain and is widely studied for its role in memory and learning, in particular, spacial memory and emotional responses. It was thought to be a homogenous structure but emerging evidence shows differentiation along the dorsoventral axis and even microdomains for functional and cellular markers. We have examined in two cell‐types of the hippocampal projection neurons, the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, if the GABA‐activated tonic current density varied between the dorsal (septal) and the ventral (temporal) poles of the male mouse hippocampus. Tonic synaptic currents, arising from spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSC), and extrasynaptic tonic currents were evaluated. The results revealed different levels of sIPSC but not mIPSC density between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurons for both the DG granule cells and the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The extrasynaptic tonic current density was larger in the DG granule cells as compared to the CA3 pyramidal neurons but did not vary between the dorsal and ventral regions. IPSC bursting was observed in both cell‐types in the ventral hippocampus but was more common in the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Only in the dorsal DG granule cells was the level of the sIPSC and mIPSC density similar. The results indicate that the tonic GABAergic inhibition is particularly strong in the ventral hippocampal DG granule cells and enhanced in the dorsal as compared to the ventral hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Data‐driven integration of hippocampal CA1 synaptic physiology in silico</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anatomy and physiology of monosynaptic connections in rodent hippocampal CA1 have been extensively studied in recent decades. Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data‐driven approach to integrate the current state‐of‐the‐art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo‐dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short‐term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different groups, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource toward a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Retinal thickness predicts the risk of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25944?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25944?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with Lewy body diseases (LBDs) were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n=42), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=4), E46K‐SNCA mutation carriers (n=4) and controls (n=17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion‐inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thickness and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cut‐offs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63 μm in iPD patients and 0.23 μm in controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.10 – 11.1, p=0.03 and RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.03 – 10.45, p=0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results provide evidence of the potential use of OCT‐measured parafoveal GCIPL thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in iPD.&lt;/p&gt;
