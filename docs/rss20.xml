Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAM’s enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DmSJoTlfGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sodium Channel Nav1.8 Underlies TTX-Resistant Axonal Action Potential Conduction in Somatosensory C-Fibers of Distal Cutaneous Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5204?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are responsible for the initiation and conduction of action potentials within primary afferents. The nine Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms recognized in mammals are often functionally divided into tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (TTX-s) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) that are blocked by nanomolar concentrations and TTX-resistant (TTX-r) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9) inhibited by millimolar concentrations, with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5 having an intermediate toxin sensitivity. For small-diameter primary afferent neurons, it is unclear to what extent different Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms are distributed along the peripheral and central branches of their bifurcated axons. To determine the relative contribution of TTX-s and TTX-r channels to action potential conduction in different axonal compartments, we investigated the effects of TTX on C-fiber-mediated compound action potentials (C-CAPs) of proximal and distal peripheral nerve segments and dorsal roots from mice and pigtail monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;). In the dorsal roots and proximal peripheral nerves of mice and nonhuman primates, TTX reduced the C-CAP amplitude to 16% of the baseline. In contrast, &amp;gt;30% of the C-CAP was resistant to TTX in distal peripheral branches of monkeys and WT and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In nerves from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, TTX-r C-CAPs could not be detected. These data indicate that Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 is the primary isoform underlying TTX-r conduction in distal axons of somatosensory C-fibers. Furthermore, there is a differential spatial distribution of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within C-fiber axons, being functionally more prominent in the most distal axons and terminal regions. The enrichment of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 in distal axons may provide a useful target in the treatment of pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether individual sodium channel isoforms exert differential roles in action potential conduction along the axonal membrane of nociceptive, unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers, but clarifying the role of sodium channel subtypes in different axonal segments may be useful for the development of novel analgesic strategies. Here, we provide evidence from mice and nonhuman primates that a substantial portion of the C-fiber compound action potential in distal peripheral nerves, but not proximal nerves or dorsal roots, is resistant to tetrodotoxin and that, in mice, this effect is mediated solely by voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8). The functional prominence of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within the axonal compartment immediately proximal to its termination may affect strategies targeting pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Choice Formation and Choice-Correlated Activity in Macaque Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Responses of individual task-relevant sensory neurons can predict monkeys' trial-by-trial choices in perceptual decision-making tasks. Choice-correlated activity has been interpreted as evidence that the responses of these neurons are causally linked to perceptual judgments. To further test this hypothesis, we studied responses of orientation-selective neurons in V1 and V2 while two macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination task. Although both animals exhibited a high level of neuronal and behavioral sensitivity, only one exhibited choice-correlated activity. Surprisingly, this correlation was negative: when a neuron fired more vigorously, the animal was less likely to choose the orientation preferred by that neuron. Moreover, choice-correlated activity emerged late in the trial, earlier in V2 than in V1, and was correlated with anticipatory signals. Together, these results suggest that choice-correlated activity in task-relevant sensory neurons can reflect postdecision modulatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When observers perform a difficult sensory discrimination, repeated presentations of the same stimulus can elicit different perceptual judgments. This behavioral variability often correlates with variability in the activity of sensory neurons driven by the stimulus. Traditionally, this correlation has been interpreted as suggesting a causal link between the activity of sensory neurons and perceptual judgments. More recently, it has been argued that the correlation instead may originate in recurrent input from other brain areas involved in the interpretation of sensory signals. Here, we call both hypotheses into question. We show that choice-related activity in sensory neurons can be highly variable across observers and can reflect modulatory processes that are dissociated from perceptual decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Uses a Real-Time Unisensory-Multisensory Transform</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the brain integrates different sensory inputs to facilitate perception and behavior has been the subject of numerous speculations. By examining multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus, the present study demonstrated that two operational principles are sufficient to understand how this remarkable result is achieved: (1) unisensory signals are integrated continuously and in real time as soon as they arrive at their common target neuron and (2) the resultant multisensory computation is modified in shape and timing by a delayed, calibrating inhibition. These principles were tested for descriptive sufficiency by embedding them in a neurocomputational model and using it to predict a neuron's moment-by-moment multisensory response given only knowledge of its responses to the individual modality-specific component cues. The predictions proved to be highly accurate, reliable, and unbiased and were, in most cases, not statistically distinguishable from the neuron's actual instantaneous multisensory response at any phase throughout its entire duration. The model was also able to explain why different multisensory products are often observed in different neurons at different time points, as well as the higher-order properties of multisensory integration, such as the dependency of multisensory products on the temporal alignment of crossmodal cues. These observations not only reveal this fundamental integrative operation, but also identify quantitatively the multisensory transform used by each neuron. As a result, they provide a means of comparing the integrative profiles among neurons and evaluating how they are affected by changes in intrinsic or extrinsic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is the process by which the brain combines information from multiple sensory sources (e.g., vision and audition) to maximize an organism's ability to identify and respond to environmental stimuli. The actual transformative process by which the neural products of multisensory integration are achieved is poorly understood. By focusing on the millisecond-by-millisecond differences between a neuron's unisensory component responses and its integrated multisensory response, it was found that this multisensory transform can be described by two basic principles: unisensory information is integrated in real time and the multisensory response is shaped by calibrating inhibition. It is now possible to use these principles to predict a neuron's multisensory response accurately armed only with knowledge of its unisensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Reversals in Neural Recruitment across Memory Retrieval Phases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5172?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5172?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several decades, neuroimaging research has identified age-related neural changes that occur during cognitive tasks. These changes are used to help researchers identify functional changes that contribute to age-related impairments in cognitive performance. One commonly reported example of such a change is an age-related decrease in the recruitment of posterior sensory regions coupled with an increased recruitment of prefrontal regions across multiple cognitive tasks. This shift is often described as a compensatory recruitment of prefrontal regions due to age-related sensory-processing deficits in posterior regions. However, age is not only associated with spatial shifts in recruitment, but also with temporal shifts, in which younger and older adults recruit the same neural region at different points in a task trial. The current study examines the possible contribution of temporal modifications in the often-reported posterior–anterior shift. Participants, ages 19–85, took part in a memory retrieval task with a protracted retrieval trial consisting of an initial memory search phase and a subsequent detail elaboration phase. Age-related neural patterns during search replicated prior reports of age-related decreases in posterior recruitment and increases in prefrontal recruitment. However, during the later elaboration phase, the same posterior regions were associated with age-related increases in activation. Further, ROI and functional connectivity results suggest that these posterior regions function similarly during search and elaboration. These results suggest that the often-reported posterior–anterior shift may not reflect the inability of older adults to engage in sensory processing, but rather a change in when they recruit this processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current study provides evidence that the often-reported posterior–anterior shift in aging may not reflect a global sensory-processing deficit, as has often been reported, but rather a temporal modification in this processing in which older adults engage the same neural regions during a detail elaboration phase that younger adults engage during memory search. In other words, older adults may ultimately be able to engage the same processes as younger adults during some cognitive tasks when given the time to do so. Future research should examine the generalizability of this effect and the importance of encouraging older adults to engage in these processes through task instruction or questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Peripheral Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-{alpha}) Modulates Amyloid Pathology by Regulating Blood-Derived Immune Cells and Glial Response in the Brain of AD/TNF Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence has suggested that systemic inflammation along with local brain inflammation can play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules that regulate the crosstalk between the immune and the CNS can provide potential therapeutic targets. TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD. Recent studies have reported that anti-TNF-α therapy or RA itself can modulate AD pathology, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. To investigate the role of peripheral TNF-α as a mediator of RA in the pathogenesis of AD, we generated double-transgenic 5XFAD/Tg197 AD/TNF mice that develop amyloid deposits and inflammatory arthritis induced by human TNF-α (huTNF-α) expression. We found that 5XFAD/Tg197 mice display decreased amyloid deposition, compromised neuronal integrity, and robust brain inflammation characterized by extensive gliosis and elevated blood-derived immune cell populations, including phagocytic macrophages and microglia. To evaluate the contribution of peripheral huTNF-α in the observed brain phenotype, we treated 5XFAD/Tg197 mice systemically with infliximab, an anti-huTNF-α antibody that does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier and prevents arthritis. Peripheral inhibition of huTNF-α increases amyloid deposition, rescues neuronal impairment, and suppresses gliosis and recruitment of blood-derived immune cells, without affecting brain huTNF-α levels. Our data report, for the first time, a distinctive role for peripheral TNF-α in the modulation of the amyloid phenotype in mice by regulating blood-derived and local brain inflammatory cell populations involved in β-amyloid clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence supports the active involvement of systemic inflammation, in addition to local brain inflammation, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. TNF-α is a pluripotent cytokine that has been independently involved in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD. Here we first demonstrate that manipulation of peripheral TNF-α in the context of arthritis modulates the amyloid phenotype by regulating immune cell trafficking in the mouse brain. Our study suggests that additionally to its local actions in the AD brain, TNF-α can also indirectly modulate amyloid pathology as a regulator of peripheral inflammation. Our findings may have significant implications in the treatment of RA patients with anti-TNF-α drugs and in the potential use of TNF-targeted therapies for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Severity of Vestibular Dysfunction in Deafness as a Determinant of Comorbid Hyperactivity or Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5144?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5144?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety-related disorders occur at rates 2–3 times higher in deaf compared with hearing children. Potential explanations for these elevated rates and the heterogeneity of behavioral disorders associated with deafness have usually focused on socio-environmental rather than biological effects. Children with the 22q11.2 deletion or duplication syndromes often display hearing loss and behavioral disorders, including ADHD and anxiety-related disorders. Here, we show that mouse mutants with either a gain or loss of function of the T-Box transcription factor gene, &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt;, which lies within the 22q11.2 region and is responsible for most of the syndromic defects, exhibit inner ear defects and hyperactivity. Furthermore, we show that (1) inner ear dysfunction due to the tissue-specific loss of &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Slc12a2&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter and is also necessary for inner ear function, causes hyperactivity; (2) vestibular rather than auditory failure causes hyperactivity; and (3) the severity rather than the age of onset of vestibular dysfunction differentiates whether hyperactivity or anxiety co-occurs with inner ear dysfunction. Together, these findings highlight a biological link between inner ear dysfunction and behavioral disorders and how sensory abnormalities can contribute to the etiology of disorders traditionally considered of cerebral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study examines the biological rather than socio-environmental reasons why hyperactivity and anxiety disorders occur at higher rates in deaf individuals. Using conditional genetic approaches in mice, the authors show that (1) inner ear dysfunction due to either &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Slc12a2&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause hyperactivity; (2) it is vestibular dysfunction, which frequently co-occurs with deafness but often remains undiagnosed, rather than auditory dysfunction that causes hyperactivity and anxiety-related symptoms; and (3) the severity of vestibular dysfunction can predict whether hyperactivity or anxiety coexist with inner ear dysfunction. These findings suggest a need to evaluate vestibular function in hearing impaired individuals, especially those who exhibit hyperactive and anxiety-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Focal Local Field Potential Signature of the Single-Axon Monosynaptic Thalamocortical Connection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5123?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5123?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A resurgence has taken place in recent years in the use of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) to investigate neural network activity. To probe monosynaptic thalamic activation of cortical postsynaptic target cells, so called spike-trigger-averaged LFP (stLFP) signatures have been measured. In these experiments, the cortical LFP is measured by multielectrodes covering several cortical lamina and averaged on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical (TC) cells. Using a well established forward-modeling scheme, we investigated the biophysical origin of this stLFP signature with simultaneous synaptic activation of cortical layer-4 neurons, mimicking the effect of a single afferent spike from a single TC neuron. Constrained by previously measured intracellular responses of the main postsynaptic target cell types and with biologically plausible assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of thalamic synaptic inputs into layer 4, the model predicted characteristic contributions to monosynaptic stLFP signatures both for the regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and the fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. In particular, the FS cells generated stLFP signatures of shorter temporal duration than the RS cells. Added together, a sum of the stLFP signatures of these two principal synaptic targets of TC cells were observed to resemble experimentally measured stLFP signatures. Outside the volume targeted by TC afferents, the resulting postsynaptic LFP signals were found to be sharply attenuated. This implies that such stLFP signatures provide a very local measure of TC synaptic activation, and that newly developed inverse current-source density (CSD)-estimation methods are needed for precise assessment of the underlying spatiotemporal CSD profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite its long history and prevalent use, the proper interpretation of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) is still not fully established. Here we investigate by biophysical modeling the origin of the focal LFP signature of the single-axon monosynaptic thalamocortical connection as measured by spike-trigger-averaging of cortical LFPs on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical neurons. We find that this LFP signature is well accounted for by a model assuming thalamic projections to two cortical layer-4 cell populations: one excitatory (putatively regular-spiking cells) and one inhibitory (putatively fast-spiking cells). The LFP signature is observed to decay sharply outside the cortical region receiving the thalamocortical projection, implying that it indeed provides a very local measure of thalamocortical synaptic activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mediation of Movement-Induced Breakthrough Cancer Pain by IB4-Binding Nociceptors in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5111?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cancer-induced bone pain is characterized by moderate to severe ongoing pain that commonly requires the use of opiates. Even when ongoing pain is well controlled, patients can suffer breakthrough pain (BTP), episodic severe pain that &quot;breaks through&quot; the medication. We developed a novel model of cancer-induced BTP using female rats with mammary adenocarcinoma cells sealed within the tibia. We demonstrated previously that rats with bone cancer learn to prefer a context paired with saphenous nerve block to elicit pain relief (i.e., conditioned place preference, CPP), revealing the presence of ongoing pain. Treatment with systemic morphine abolished CPP to saphenous nerve block, demonstrating control of ongoing pain. Here, we show that pairing BTP induced by experimenter-induced movement of the tumor-bearing hindlimb with a context produces conditioned place avoidance (CPA) in rats treated with morphine to control ongoing pain, consistent with clinical observation of BTP. Preventing movement-induced afferent input by saphenous nerve block before, but not after, hindlimb movement blocked movement-induced BTP. Ablation of isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, sensory afferents eliminated movement-induced BTP, suggesting that input from IB4-binding fibers mediates BTP. Identification of potential molecular targets specific to this population of fibers may allow for the development of peripherally restricted analgesics that control BTP and improve quality of life in patients with skeletal metastases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We present a novel preclinical measure of movement-induced breakthrough pain (BTP) that is observed in the presence of morphine controlling ongoing pain. Blockade of sensory input before movement prevented BTP, whereas nerve block after movement failed to reverse BTP. These observations indicate that blocking peripheral sensory input may prevent BTP and targeting central sites may be required for pain relief once BTP has been initiated. Preventing sensory input from TRPV1-expressing fibers failed to alter movement-induced BTP. In contrast, preventing sensory input from isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding fibers blocked movement-induced BTP. Therefore, examining molecular targets on this population of nociceptive fibers may prove useful for developing an improved strategy for preventing BTP in cancer patients with skeletal metastases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive mitochondrial fission is a prominent early event and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic failure, and neuronal cell death in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission is beneficial in mammal models of AD. To determine whether dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fragmentation, can be a disease-modifying therapeutic target for AD, we examined the effects of Drp1 inhibitor on mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions induced by oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) in neurons and neuropathology and cognitive functions in Aβ precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic AD mice. Inhibition of Drp1 alleviates mitochondrial fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, ATP reduction, and synaptic depression in Aβ-treated neurons. Furthermore, Drp1 inhibition significantly improves learning and memory and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ deposition in the brain in the AD model. These results provide evidence that Drp1 plays an important role in Aβ-mediated and AD-related neuropathology and in cognitive decline in an AD animal model. Therefore, inhibiting excessive Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission may be an efficient therapeutic avenue for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondrial fission relies on the evolutionary conserved dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 activity and mitochondria fragmentation are significantly elevated in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the inhibition of Drp1 restored amyloid-β (Aβ)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunctions and synaptic depression in neurons and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ deposition in the brain of AD mice. As a result, memory deficits in AD mice were rescued by Drp1 inhibition. These results suggest that neuropathology and combined cognitive decline can be attributed to hyperactivation of Drp1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, inhibitors of excessive mitochondrial fission, such as Drp1 inhibitors, may be a new strategy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visually Evoked 3-5 Hz Membrane Potential Oscillations Reduce the Responsiveness of Visual Cortex Neurons in Awake Behaving Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low-frequency membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) oscillations were once thought to only occur in sleeping and anesthetized states. Recently, low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations have been described in inactive awake animals, but it is unclear whether they shape sensory processing in neurons and whether they occur during active awake behavioral states. To answer these questions, we performed two-photon guided whole-cell &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; recordings from primary visual cortex layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and performance of visual and auditory discrimination tasks. We recorded stereotyped 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations where the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; baseline hyperpolarized as the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; underwent high amplitude rhythmic fluctuations lasting 1–2 s in duration. When 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations coincided with visual cues, excitatory neuron responses to preferred cues were significantly reduced. Despite this disruption to sensory processing, visual cues were critical for evoking 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations when animals performed discrimination tasks and passively viewed drifting grating stimuli. Using pupillometry and animal locomotive speed as indicators of arousal, we found that 3–5 Hz oscillations were not restricted to unaroused states and that they occurred equally in aroused and unaroused states. Therefore, low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations play a role in shaping sensory processing in visual cortical neurons, even during active wakefulness and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A neuron's membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) strongly shapes how information is processed in sensory cortices of awake animals. Yet, very little is known about how low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations influence sensory processing and whether they occur in aroused awake animals. By performing two-photon guided whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex of awake behaving animals, we found visually evoked stereotyped 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations that disrupt excitatory responsiveness to visual stimuli. Moreover, these oscillations occurred when animals were in high and low arousal states as measured by animal speed and pupillometry. These findings show, for the first time, that low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations can significantly modulate sensory signal processing, even in awake active animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Dissonance (Revised): An EEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5074?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5074?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that our preferences are modulated by the mere act of choosing. A choice between two similarly valued alternatives creates psychological tension (cognitive dissonance) that is reduced by a postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives. We measured EEG of human subjects during rest and free-choice paradigm. Our study demonstrates that choices associated with stronger cognitive dissonance trigger a larger negative frontocentral evoked response similar to error-related negativity, which has in turn been implicated in general performance monitoring. Furthermore, the amplitude of the evoked response is correlated with the reevaluation of the alternatives. We also found a link between individual neural dynamics (long-range temporal correlations) of the frontocentral cortices during rest and follow-up neural and behavioral effects of cognitive dissonance. Individuals with stronger resting-state long-range temporal correlations demonstrated a greater postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives and larger evoked brain responses associated with stronger cognitive dissonance. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive dissonance is reflected in both resting-state and choice-related activity of the prefrontal cortex as part of the general performance-monitoring circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Contrary to traditional decision theory, behavioral studies repeatedly demonstrate that our preferences are modulated by the mere act of choosing. Difficult choices generate psychological (cognitive) dissonance, which is reduced by the postdecisional devaluation of unchosen options. We found that decisions associated with a higher level of cognitive dissonance elicited a stronger negative frontocentral deflection that peaked ~60 ms after the response. This activity shares similar spatial and temporal features as error-related negativity, the electrophysiological correlate of performance monitoring. Furthermore, the frontocentral resting-state activity predicted the individual magnitude of preference change and the strength of cognitive dissonance-related neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Effects and Sex Differences in Gray Matter Density, Volume, Mass, and Cortical Thickness from Childhood to Young Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5065?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental structural neuroimaging studies in humans have long described decreases in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT) during adolescence. Gray matter density (GMD), a measure often assumed to be highly related to volume, has not been systematically investigated in development. We used T1 imaging data collected on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort to study age-related effects and sex differences in four regional gray matter measures in 1189 youths ranging in age from 8 to 23 years. Custom T1 segmentation and a novel high-resolution gray matter parcellation were used to extract GMD, GMV, gray matter mass (GMM; defined as GMD &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; GMV), and CT from 1625 brain regions. Nonlinear models revealed that each modality exhibits unique age-related effects and sex differences. While GMV and CT generally decrease with age, GMD increases and shows the strongest age-related effects, while GMM shows a slight decline overall. Females have lower GMV but higher GMD than males throughout the brain. Our findings suggest that GMD is a prime phenotype for the assessment of brain development and likely cognition and that periadolescent gray matter loss may be less pronounced than previously thought. This work highlights the need for combined quantitative histological MRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates that different MRI-derived gray matter measures show distinct age and sex effects and should not be considered equivalent but complementary. It is shown for the first time that gray matter density increases from childhood to young adulthood, in contrast with gray matter volume and cortical thickness, and that females, who are known to have lower gray matter volume than males, have higher density throughout the brain. A custom preprocessing pipeline and a novel high-resolution parcellation were created to analyze brain scans of 1189 youths collected as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. A clear understanding of normal structural brain development is essential for the examination of brain–behavior relationships, the study of brain disease, and, ultimately, clinical applications of neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Orbitofrontal and Anterior Cingulate Pathways to the Amygdala Target Inhibitory and Excitatory Systems with Opposite Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5051?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5051?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bidirectional dialogue of the primate posterior orbitofrontal cortex (pOFC) with the amygdala is essential in cognitive–emotional functions. The pOFC also sends a uniquely one-way excitatory pathway to the amygdalar inhibitory intercalated masses (IM), which inhibit the medial part of the central amygdalar nucleus (CeM). Inhibition of IM has the opposite effect, allowing amygdalar activation of autonomic structures and emotional arousal. Using multiple labeling approaches to identify pathways and their postsynaptic sites in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys, we found that the anterior cingulate cortex innervated mostly the basolateral and CeM amygdalar nuclei, poised to activate CeM for autonomic arousal. By contrast, a pathway from pOFC to IM exceeded all other pathways to the amygdala by density and size and proportion of large and efficient terminals. Moreover, whereas pOFC terminals in IM innervated each of the three distinct classes of inhibitory neurons, most targeted neurons expressing dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+), known to be modulated by dopamine. The predominant pOFC innervation of DARPP-32+ neurons suggests activation of IM and inhibition of CeM, resulting in modulated autonomic function. By contrast, inhibition of DARPP-32 neurons in IM by high dopamine levels disinhibits CeM and triggers autonomic arousal. The findings provide a mechanism to help explain how a strong pOFC pathway, which is poised to moderate activity of CeM, through IM, can be undermined by the high level of dopamine during stress, resulting in collapse of potent inhibitory mechanisms in the amygdala and heightened autonomic drive, as seen in chronic anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dialogue between prefrontal cortex and amygdala allows thoughts and emotions to influence actions. The posterior orbitofrontal cortex sends a powerful pathway that targets a special class of amygdalar intercalated mass (IM) inhibitory neurons, whose wiring may help modulate autonomic function. By contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex innervates other amygdalar parts, activating circuits to help avoid danger. Most IM neurons in primates label for the protein DARPP-32, known to be activated or inhibited based on the level of dopamine. Stress markedly increases dopamine release and inhibits IM neurons, compromises prefrontal control of the amygdala, and sets off a general alarm system as seen in affective disorders, such as chronic anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum neurofilament light: A biomarker of neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24954</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24954</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;: Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are unique to neuronal cells, are shed to the CSF and are detectable at low concentrations in peripheral blood. Various diseases causing neuronal damage have resulted in elevated CSF concentrations. We explored the value of an ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) serum NfL (sNfL) assay in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were measured in healthy controls (HC, n=254) and two independent MS cohorts: (1) cross-sectional with paired serum and CSF samples (n=142); (2) longitudinal with repeated serum sampling (n=246, median (IQR) follow-up 3.1 (2.0-4.0) years). We assessed their relation to concurrent clinical, imaging and treatment parameters and to future clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were higher in both MS cohorts than in HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). We found a strong association between CSF NfL and sNfL (β=0.589, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Patients with either brain or spinal (43.4 (25.2-65.3) pg/ml) or both brain and spinal gadolinium enhancing lesions (62.5 (42.7-71.4) pg/ml) had higher sNfL than those without (29.6 (20.9-41.8) pg/ml; β=1.461, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.005 and β=1.902, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.002 respectively). sNfL was independently associated with EDSS assessments (β=1.105, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and presence of relapses (β=1.430, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). sNfL levels were lower under disease modifying treatment (β=0.818, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.003). Patients with sNfL levels above the 80&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; HC based percentiles had higher risk of relapses (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: IRR=1.94, 95%CI=1.21-3.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.006) and EDSS worsening (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: OR=2.41, 95%CI=1.07-5.42, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.034).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;: These results support the value of sNfL as a sensitive and clinically meaningful blood biomarker to monitor tissue damage and the effects of therapies in MS.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimized brute-force algorithms for the bifurcation analysis of a spin-glass-like neural network model. (arXiv:1705.05647v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bifurcation theory is a powerful tool for studying how the dynamics of a
neural network model depends on its underlying neurophysiological parameters.
However, bifurcation theory has been developed mostly for smooth dynamical
systems and for continuous-time non-smooth models, which prevents us from
understanding the changes of dynamics in some widely used classes of artificial
neural network models. This article is an attempt to fill this gap, through the
introduction of algorithms that perform a semi-analytical bifurcation analysis
of a spin-glass-like neural network model with binary firing rates and
discrete-time evolution. Our approach is based on a numerical brute-force
search of the stationary and oscillatory solutions of the spin-glass model,
from which we derive analytical expressions of its bifurcation structure by
means of the state-to-state transition probability matrix. The algorithms
determine how the network parameters affect the degree of multistability, the
emergence and the period of the neural oscillations, and the formation of
symmetry-breaking in the neural populations. While this technique can be
applied to networks with arbitrary (generally asymmetric) connectivity
matrices, in particular we introduce a highly efficient algorithm for the
bifurcation analysis of sparse networks. We also provide some examples of the
obtained bifurcation diagrams and a Python implementation of the algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: GP CaKe: Effective brain connectivity with causal kernels. (arXiv:1705.05603v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental goal in network neuroscience is to understand how activity in
one region drives activity elsewhere, a process referred to as effective
connectivity. Here we propose to model this causal interaction using
integro-differential equations and causal kernels that allow for a rich
analysis of effective connectivity. The approach combines the tractability and
flexibility of autoregressive modeling with the biophysical interpretability of
dynamic causal modeling. The causal kernels are learned nonparametrically using
Gaussian process regression, yielding an efficient framework for causal
inference. We construct a novel class of causal covariance functions that
enforce the desired properties of the causal kernels, an approach which we call
GP CaKe. By construction, the model and its hyperparameters have biophysical
meaning and are therefore easily interpretable. We demonstrate the efficacy of
GP CaKe on a number of simulations and give an example of a realistic
application on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sparse Coding by Spiking Neural Networks: Convergence Theory and Computational Results. (arXiv:1705.05475v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05475</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a spiking neural network (SNN), individual neurons operate autonomously
and only communicate with other neurons sparingly and asynchronously via spike
signals. These characteristics render a massively parallel hardware
implementation of SNN a potentially powerful computer, albeit a non von Neumann
one. But can one guarantee that a SNN computer solves some important problems
reliably? In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model of one SNN that can
be configured for a sparse coding problem for feature extraction. With a
moderate but well-defined assumption, we prove that the SNN indeed solves
sparse coding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous result
of this kind.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Learning Mid-Level Auditory Codes from Natural Sound Statistics. (arXiv:1701.07138v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interaction with the world requires an organism to transform sensory signals
into representations in which behaviorally meaningful properties of the
environment are made explicit. These representations are derived through
cascades of neuronal processing stages in which neurons at each stage recode
the output of preceding stages. Explanations of sensory coding may thus involve
understanding how low-level patterns are combined into more complex structures.
Although models exist in the visual domain to explain how mid-level features
such as junctions and curves might be derived from oriented filters in early
visual cortex, little is known about analogous grouping principles for
mid-level auditory representations. We propose a hierarchical generative model
of natural sounds that learns combinations of spectrotemporal features from
natural stimulus statistics. In the first layer the model forms a sparse
convolutional code of spectrograms using a dictionary of learned
spectrotemporal kernels. To generalize from specific kernel activation
patterns, the second layer encodes patterns of time-varying magnitude of
multiple first layer coefficients. Because second-layer features are sensitive
to combinations of spectrotemporal features, the representation they support
encodes more complex acoustic patterns than the first layer. When trained on
corpora of speech and environmental sounds, some second-layer units learned to
group spectrotemporal features that occur together in natural sounds. Others
instantiate opponency between dissimilar sets of spectrotemporal features. Such
groupings might be instantiated by neurons in the auditory cortex, providing a
hypothesis for mid-level neuronal computation.

	<description>Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) was originally identified as a slow Ca2+ sensor for lysosome fusion, but its function at fast synapses is controversial. The paper by Luo and Südhof (2017) in this issue of Neuron shows that at the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem Syt7 triggers asynchronous release during stimulus trains, resulting in reliable and temporally precise high-frequency transmission. Thus, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse.</description>

	<description>In the early 1960s, few neuroscientists attempted to model brain function using mathematics. Computers were slow and expensive, so numerical approximations of complex phenomena were out of reach in most cases, and scientists resorted primarily to analytical representations of simpler processes. The study of circuits was not new to Walter J. Freeman. He had started his education studying engineering at MIT (transferring later to the University of Chicago to study English) and was a radio operator in WWII.</description>

	<description>Functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fcMRI) has assumed a central role in neuroimaging efforts to understand the changes underlying brain disorders. Current models of the spatial and temporal structure of fcMRI based connectivity contain strong a priori assumptions. We report that low temporal frequency fMRI signal synchrony within the local (3 mm radius) neighborhood of a location on the cortical surface strongly predicts the scale of its global functional connectivity. This relationship is tested vertex-wise across the cortex using Spearmans rank order correlation on an individual subject basis. Furthermore, this relationship is shown to be dynamically preserved across repeated within session scans. These results provide a model free data driven method to visualize and quantitatively analyze patterns of connectivity at the imaging voxel resolution across the entire cortex on an individual subject basis. The procedure thus provides a tool to check directly the validity of spatial and temporal prior assumptions incorporated in the analysis of fcMRI data.</description>

	<description>The motor system prepares for movements well in advance of their execution. In the gaze control system, premotor neurons that produce a burst of activity for the movement are also active leading up to the saccade. The dynamics of preparatory neural activity have been well described by stochastic accumulator models, and variability in the accumulation dynamics has been shown to be correlated with reaction times of the eventual saccade, but it is unclear whether this activity is purely preparatory in nature or has features indicative of a hidden movement command. We explicitly tested whether preparatory neural activity in premotor neurons of the primate superior colliculus has &quot;motor potential&quot;. We removed inhibition on the saccadic system using reflex blinks, which turn off downstream gating, and found that saccades can be initiated before underlying activity reaches levels seen under normal conditions. Accumulating low-frequency activity was predictive of eye movement dynamics tens of milliseconds in advance of the actual saccade, indicating the presence of a latent movement command. We also show that reaching threshold is not a necessary condition for movement initiation, contrary to the postulates of accumulation-to-threshold models. The results bring into question extant models of saccade generation and support the possibility of a concurrent representation for movement preparation and generation.</description>

	<description>The stabilizing role of sensory feedback in relation to movement dynamics remains to be poorly understood in realistic three-dimensional movements of limbs. The objective of this experimental and computational study was to classify the contribution of sensory feedback from muscle spindles to the control of assistive and resistive limb dynamics during human pointing movements. We integrated a human upper-limb musculoskeletal model with a model of Ia primary afferent discharge to analyze motion and muscle activation patterns during reaching movements in virtual reality (VR). The reaching target locations in VR were selected to define movements with varying roles of gravity and interaction torques that created diverse dynamical contexts. Nine healthy human subjects performed the VR task by pointing to the reaching targets with visual feedback of their arm location. Motion capture and electromyography (EMG) were recorded, and joint torques and Ia primary afferent discharge were estimated using the integrated model. The experimental and simulated data were analyzed with hierarchal clustering (Gritsenko et al., 2016). The clustering analysis of EMG and predicted proprioceptive signals showed a divergent relationship between muscle activation and sensory feedback patterns. Even though the Ia models had nonlinear dynamical components, their output was still most related to the anatomical grouping of muscles and less so to the dynamical contexts of each movement, reflected in muscle activations. Altogether, these results suggest that sensory feedback is nonlinearly related to muscle activation profiles and that it may contribute information necessary for coupling between proximal and distal muscle groups.</description>

	<description>What if you could affect both neuroplasticity and human cognitive performance by parametrically modulating neural oscillations? Ongoing neuronal activity is susceptible to the modulation of synaptic activity and membrane potentials. This susceptibility leverages transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for neuroplastic interventions. Through neuromodulation of phasic, neural activity, tACS presents a powerful tool for investigations of the neural correlates of cognition alongside other forms of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) and noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). The rapid pace of development in this area requires clarification of best practices. Here, we briefly introduce tACS dogma and review the most compelling findings from the tACS literature to provide a starting point for the use of tACS under research conditions.</description>

	<description>The brain's ability to adapt behavior is crucial to survival. Long-term learning of dexterous motor skills likely requires plastic changes in cortex, but we can also learn even from errors in single movements. Such trial-to-trial adaptation likely requires a faster mechanism. Here, we show how the brain can adapt behavior by redeploying existing population activity patterns without altering the functional structure of the cortex. We recorded from both primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex in macaque monkeys during motor learning. We trained computational models to predict single neuron spiking based on the activity of the surrounding neural population in order to study the functional relationships between neurons within the two areas. Intriguingly, the functional structure within each area was preserved throughout learning, suggesting that the underlying neural circuitry remained unaltered. To study the interaction between the areas, we separated the PMd activity into two sets of components: &quot;potent&quot; components that captured activity that mapped onto M1, and &quot;null&quot; components that captured activity patterns with effects only within PMd. As was true within each area, the activity of the potent components consistently predicted M1 spiking throughout its learning-related changes. In stark contrast, the mapping from the null components gradually changed with learning. These results show that, at a population level, PMd develops new motor plans (reflected in the null components) that are transmitted to M1 through an unchanged functional mapping (captured by the potent components) between the two areas. Use of the PMd-to-M1 null space as a neural scratch pad for the gradual development of new motor plans is a powerful mechanism that may explain a variety of rapid learning processes throughout the brain.</description>

	<description>Cortical networks are composed of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Although fewer in number relative to projection neurons, interneurons have essential roles in brain activity and behavior since they adjust cortical excitation and control network dynamics. Therefore, the number of cortical interneurons (CIs) must be tightly controlled during development to meet the functional requirements of emerging neuronal circuits. CIs are generated in excess from basal forebrain progenitors and it has been proposed recently that their final number is adjusted via intrinsically determined apoptosis occurring during an early postnatal window. Here we provide evidence that the extent of CI apoptosis during this critical period is plastic, cell type specific and can be reduced in a cell autonomous manner by acute increases in neuronal activity. We further show that hyperactive networks promote the survival of transplanted CIs. We propose that the level of activity in emerging neural networks controls in a homeostatic manner the number of CIs.</description>

Here, we report that the stress-inducible 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78/HSPA5), a key regulator of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and PI3K/AKT signaling, is overexpressed in the acini and PDAC of Pdx1-Cre;KrasG12D/+;p53f/+ (PKC) mice as early as...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/_zfbPi8LEVI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) homologous factor FGF13, a noncanonical FGF, has been best characterized as a voltage-gated Na+ channel auxiliary subunit. Other cellular functions have been suggested, but not explored. In inducible, cardiac-specific Fgf13 knockout mice, we found—even in the context of the expected reduction in Na+ channel current—an...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/0IoLwU7zXEQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The peptide substance P (SP) and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been implicated in inflammatory processes. Mast cells are recognized as important in inflammatory responses. Here, we report that IL-33 (30 ng/mL), a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, administered in combination with SP (1 µM), markedly...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/R8oWEESt238&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Bromodomain-containing factor Brd4 has emerged as an important transcriptional regulator of NF-κB–dependent inflammatory gene expression. However, the in vivo physiological function of Brd4 in the inflammatory response remains poorly defined. We now demonstrate that mice deficient for Brd4 in myeloid-lineage cells are resistant to LPS-induced sepsis but are more susceptible...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/dagilrVbAqc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Interspersed repeat sequences comprise much of our DNA, although their functional effects are poorly understood. The most commonly occurring repeat is the Alu short interspersed element. New Alu insertions occur in human populations, and have been responsible for several instances of genetic disease.

	<description>Visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain by distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It is largely unknown how RGCs acquire their defining morphological and physiological features and connect to upstream and downstream synaptic partners.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochastic resonance and optimal information transfer at criticality on a network model of the human connectome. (arXiv:1705.05248v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which noise enhances the response of
a system to an input signal. The brain is an example of a system that has to
detect and transmit signals in a noisy environment, suggesting that it is a
good candidate to take advantage of SR. In this work, we aim to identify the
optimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple
network model of the human brain. Specifically, using a dynamic model
implemented on an anatomical brain network (connectome), we investigate the
similarity between an input signal and a signal that has traveled across the
network while the system is subject to different noise levels. We find that
non-zero levels of noise enhance the similarity between the input signal and
the signal that has traveled through the system. The optimal noise level is not
unique; rather, there is a set of parameter values at which the information is
transmitted with greater precision, this set corresponds to the parameter
values that place the system in a critical regime. The multiplicity of critical
points in our model allows it to adapt to different noise situations and remain
at criticality.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Determinants of gait stability while walking on a treadmill: a machine learning approach. (arXiv:1705.05191v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic balance in human locomotion can be assessed through the local dynamic
stability (LDS) method. Whereas gait LDS has been used successfully in many
settings and applications, little is known about its sensitivity to individual
characteristics of healthy adults. Therefore, we reanalyzed a large dataset of
accelerometric data measured for 100 healthy adults from 20 to 70 years of age
performing 10 min. treadmill walking. We sought to assess the extent to which
the variations of age, body mass and height, sex, and preferred walking speed
(PWS) could influence gait LDS. The random forest (RF) and multiple adaptive
regression splines (MARS) algorithms were selected for their good bias-variance
tradeoff and their capabilities to handle nonlinear associations. First, using
variable importance measure (VIM), we used RF to evaluate which individual
characteristics had the highest influence on gait LDS. Second, we used MARS to
detect potential interactions among individual characteristics that may
influence LDS. The VIM and MARS results evidenced that PWS and age correlated
with LDS, whereas no associations were found for sex, body height, and body
mass. Further, the MARS model detected an age x PWS interaction: on one hand,
at high PWS, gait stability is constant across age while, on the other hand, at
low PWS, gait instability increases substantially with age. We conclude that it
is advisable to consider the participants' age as well as their PWS to avoid
potential biases in evaluating dynamic balance through LDS.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study we describe a methodology to realize visual images cognition in
the broader sense, by a cross-modal stimulation through the auditory channel.
An original algorithm of conversion from bi-dimensional images to sounds has
been established and tested on several subjects. Our results show that subjects
where able to discriminate with a precision of 95\% different sounds
corresponding to different test geometric shapes. Moreover, after brief
learning sessions on simple images, subjects where able to recognize among a
group of 16 complex and never-trained images a single target by hearing its
acoustical counterpart. Rate of recognition was found to depend on image
characteristics, in 90% of the cases, subjects did better than choosing at
random. This study contribute to the understanding of cross-modal perception
and help for the realization of systems that use acoustical signals to help
visually impaired persons to recognize objects and improve navigation

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain processes a wide variety of inputs and does so either
consciously or subconsciously. According to the Global Workspace theory,
conscious processing involves broadcasting of information to several regions of
the brain and subconscious processing involves more localized processing. This
theoretical paper aims to expand on some of the aspects of the Global Workspace
theory: how the properties of incoming information result in it being processed
subconsciously or consciously; why processing can be either be sustained or
short-lived; how the Global Workspace theory may apply both to real-time
sensory input as well as to internally retained information. This paper
proposes that: familiar input which does not elicit intense emotions becomes
processed subconsciously and such processing can be continuous and sustained;
input that elicits relatively intense emotions is subjected to highly
sustainable conscious processing; input can also undergo meta-conscious
processing. Such processing is not very sustainable but can exert control over
other cognitive processes. This paper also discusses possible benefits of
regulating cognitive processes this way.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Face recognition assessments used in the study of super-recognisers. (arXiv:1705.04739v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04739</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of nine assessments
of face processing skills. These tests have been used commonly in recent years
to gauge the skills of perspective 'super-recognisers' with respect to the
general population. In the literature, a person has been considered to be a
'super-recogniser' based on superior scores on one or more of these tests (cf.,
Noyes, Phillips &amp;amp; O'Toole, in press). The paper provides a supplement to a
recent review of super-recognisers aimed at readers who are unfamiliar with
these tests. That review provides a complete summary of the super-recongiser
literature to date (2017). It also provides a theory and a set of action points
directed at answering the question &quot;What is a super-recogniser?&quot;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that the brain performs approximate probabilistic
inference to estimate causal variables in the world from ambiguous sensory
data. To understand these computations, we need to analyze how information is
represented and transformed by the actions of nonlinear recurrent neural
networks. We propose that these probabilistic computations function by a
message-passing algorithm operating at the level of redundant neural
populations. To explain this framework, we review its underlying concepts,
including graphical models, sufficient statistics, and message-passing, and
then describe how these concepts could be implemented by recurrently connected
probabilistic population codes. The relevant information flow in these networks
will be most interpretable at the population level, particularly for redundant
neural codes. We therefore outline a general approach to identify the essential
features of a neural message-passing algorithm. Finally, we argue that to
reveal the most important aspects of these neural computations, we must study
large-scale activity patterns during moderately complex, naturalistic
behaviors.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Criticality or Supersymmetry Breaking ?. (arXiv:1609.00001v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00001</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00001</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many stochastic dynamical systems, ordinary chaotic behavior is preceded
by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or
scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes,
etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized
criticality, the recently found approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastics (STS) identifies this phase as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase),
i.e., the phase where the topological supersymmetry pertaining to all
stochastic dynamical systems is broken spontaneously by the condensation of the
noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here, we support this picture in the context
of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of neuron-like elements and find that the
dynamics in the N-phase is indeed featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov
exponents and dominated by (anti)instantonic processes of
(creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks, which can be viewed as
predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also construct the phase
diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey neuromorphic hardware
and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in the deterministic
limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the application of STS to
neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain can reside only in
the N-phase.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Aberrant Cortical Activity In Multiple GCaMP6-Expressing Transgenic Mouse Lines</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138511v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Transgenic mouse lines are invaluable tools for neuroscience but as with any technique, care must be taken to ensure that the tool itself does not unduly affect the system under study. Here we report aberrant electrical activity, similar to interictal spikes, and accompanying fluorescence events in some genotypes of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6 genetically-encoded calcium sensors. These epileptiform events have been observed particularly, but not exclusively, in mice with Emx1-Cre and Ai93 transgenes, across multiple laboratories. The events occur at &amp;gt;0.1 Hz, are very large in amplitude (&amp;gt;1.0 mV local field potentials, &amp;gt;10% df/f widefield imaging signals), and typically cover large regions of cortex. Many properties of neuronal responses and behavior seem normal despite these events, though rare subjects exhibit overt generalized seizures. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear, but we speculate about possible causes on the basis of diverse observations. We encourage researchers to be aware of these activity patterns while interpreting neuronal recordings from affected mouse lines and when considering which lines to study.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A 340/380 nm Light Emitting Diode Illuminator For Fura-2 AM Ratiometric Ca2+ Imaging Of Live Cells With Better Than 5 nM Precision</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138495v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138495v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We report the first demonstration of a fast wavelength-switchable 340/380 nm light emitting diode (LED) illuminator for Fura-2 ratiometric Ca2+ imaging of live cells. The LEDs closely match the excitation peaks of bound and free Fura-2 and enables the precise detection of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which is only limited by the Ca2+ response of Fura-2. Using this illuminator, we have shown that Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) concentrations as low as 250 nM can be used to detect induced Ca2+ events in tsA-201 cells and while utilizing the 150 s switching speeds available, it was possible to image spontaneous Ca2+ transients in hippocampal neurons at a rate of 24.39 Hz that were blunted or absent at typical 0.5 Hz acquisition rates. Overall, the sensitivity and acquisition speeds available using this LED illuminator significantly improve the temporal resolution that can be obtained in comparison to current systems and supports optical imaging of fast Ca2+ events using Fura-2.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138149v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The N400 component of the event-related brain potential has aroused much interest because it is thought to provide an online measure of meaning processing in the brain. This component, however, has been hard to capture within traditional approaches to language processing. Here, we show that a neural network that eschews these traditions can capture a wide range of findings on the factors that affect the amplitude of the N400. The model simulates the N400 as the change induced by an incoming word in an initial, implicit probabilistic representation of the situation or event described by the linguistic input, captured by the hidden unit activation pattern in a neural network. We further propose a new learning rule in which the process underlying the N400 drives implicit learning in the network. The model provides a unified account of a large body of findings and connects human language processing with successful deep learning approaches to language processing.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137976v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Parkinson's disease, the most common age-related movement disorder, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with unclear etiology. Key neuropathological hallmarks are Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are neuronal inclusions that are immunopositive for the protein alpha-synuclein. In-depth ultrastructural analysis of Lewy pathology is key to understanding pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Using correlative light and electron microscopy on postmortem brain tissue of Parkinson's patients, we discovered a crowded membranous medley of vesicular structures, dysmorphic mitochondria and disrupted cytoskeletal elements in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, rather than the widely expected proteinacious filaments. The collapse and crowding of central organellar components was confirmed by stimulated emission-depletion microscopy, and chemical and optical imaging. A high lipid content was confirmed by lipidomics. The findings indicate ill-defined subcellular protein-lipid compartmentalization and point toward impaired organellar trafficking as a key driver of pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease.</description>

High-order epistasis—where the effect of a mutation is determined by interactions with two or more other mutations—makes small, but detectable, contributions to genotype-fitness maps. While epistasis between pairs of mutations is known to be an important determinant of evolutionary trajectories, the evolutionary consequences of high-order epistasis remain poorly understood. To determine the effect of high-order epistasis on evolutionary trajectories, we computationally removed high-order epistasis from experimental genotype-fitness maps containing all binary combinations of five mutations. We then compared trajectories through maps both with and without high-order epistasis. We found that high-order epistasis strongly shapes the accessibility and probability of evolutionary trajectories. A closer analysis revealed that the magnitude of epistasis, not its order, predicts is effects on evolutionary trajectories. We further find that high-order epistasis makes it impossible to predict evolutionary trajectories from the individual and paired effects of mutations. We therefore conclude that high-order epistasis profoundly shapes evolutionary trajectories through genotype-fitness maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NtwkDDZsJfQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint, the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other microbes in the community. This is particularly important for predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes significant restrictions on the allowable community membership, composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement. SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis. SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a microbial community in a given environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aaCKYVh0KtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An independent component analysis confounding factor correction framework for identifying broad impact expression quantitative trait loci</title>

Genome-wide expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies in humans have provided numerous insights into the genetics of both gene expression and complex diseases. While the majority of eQTL identified in genome-wide analyses impact a single gene, eQTL that impact many genes are particularly valuable for network modeling and disease analysis. To enable the identification of such broad impact eQTL, we introduce CONFETI: Confounding Factor Estimation Through Independent component analysis. CONFETI is designed to address two conflicting issues when searching for broad impact eQTL: the need to account for non-genetic confounding factors that can lower the power of the analysis or produce broad impact eQTL false positives, and the tendency of methods that account for confounding factors to model broad impact eQTL as non-genetic variation. The key advance of the CONFETI framework is the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify variation likely caused by broad impact eQTL when constructing the sample covariance matrix used for the random effect in a mixed model. We show that CONFETI has better performance than other mixed model confounding factor methods when considering broad impact eQTL recovery from synthetic data. We also used the CONFETI framework and these same confounding factor methods to identify eQTL that replicate between matched twin pair datasets in the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER), the Depression Genes Networks study (DGN), the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), and multiple tissue types in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. These analyses identified both &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL impacting individual genes, and CONFETI had better or comparable performance to other mixed model confounding factor analysis methods when identifying such eQTL. In these analyses, we were able to identify and replicate a few broad impact eQTL although the overall number was small even when applying CONFETI. In light of these results, we discuss the broad impact eQTL that have been previously reported from the analysis of human data and suggest that considerable caution should be exercised when making biological inferences based on these reported eQTL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZIqMhY0aoqQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A predictive coding account of bistable perception - a model-based fMRI study</title>

In bistable vision, subjective perception wavers between two interpretations of a constant ambiguous stimulus. This dissociation between conscious perception and sensory stimulation has motivated various empirical studies on the neural correlates of bistable perception, but the neurocomputational mechanism behind endogenous perceptual transitions has remained elusive. Here, we recurred to a generic Bayesian framework of predictive coding and devised a model that casts endogenous perceptual transitions as a consequence of prediction errors emerging from residual evidence for the suppressed percept. Data simulations revealed close similarities between the model’s predictions and key temporal characteristics of perceptual bistability, indicating that the model was able to reproduce bistable perception. Fitting the predictive coding model to behavioural data from an fMRI-experiment on bistable perception, we found a correlation across participants between the model parameter encoding perceptual stabilization and the behaviourally measured frequency of perceptual transitions, corroborating that the model successfully accounted for participants’ perception. Formal model comparison with established models of bistable perception based on mutual inhibition and adaptation, noise or a combination of adaptation and noise was used for the validation of the predictive coding model against the established models. Most importantly, model-based analyses of the fMRI data revealed that prediction error time-courses derived from the predictive coding model correlated with neural signal time-courses in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and anterior insulae. Voxel-wise model selection indicated a superiority of the predictive coding model over conventional analysis approaches in explaining neural activity in these frontal areas, suggesting that frontal cortex encodes prediction errors that mediate endogenous perceptual transitions in bistable perception. Taken together, our current work provides a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of behavioural and neural data using a predictive coding perspective on bistable perception. In this, our approach posits a crucial role of prediction error signalling for the resolution of perceptual ambiguities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X6E3z9L-p5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mixture models reveal multiple positional bias types in RNA-Seq data and lead to accurate transcript concentration estimates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Tuerk, Gregor Wiktorin, Serhat Güler&lt;/p&gt;

Accuracy of transcript quantification with RNA-Seq is negatively affected by positional fragment bias. This article introduces Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (rd. “mixquare”), a transcript quantification method which uses a mixture of probability distributions to model and thereby neutralize the effects of positional fragment bias. The parameters of Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are trained by Expectation Maximization resulting in simultaneous transcript abundance and bias estimates. We compare Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to Cufflinks, RSEM, eXpress and PennSeq; state-of-the-art quantification methods implementing some form of bias correction. On four synthetic biases we show that the accuracy of Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; overall exceeds the accuracy of the other methods and that its bias estimates converge to the correct solution. We further evaluate Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on real RNA-Seq data from the Microarray and Sequencing Quality Control (MAQC, SEQC) Consortia. On MAQC data, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieves improved correlation to qPCR measurements with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 4% and 50%. Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; also yields repeatable concentration estimates across technical replicates with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 8% and 47% and reduced standard deviation across the full concentration range. We further observe more accurate detection of differential expression with a relative increase in true positives between 74% and 378% for 5% false positives. In addition, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reveals 5 dominant biases in MAQC data deviating from the common assumption of a uniform fragment distribution. On SEQC data, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; yields higher consistency between measured and predicted concentration ratios. A relative error of 20% or less is obtained for 51% of transcripts by Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 40% of transcripts by Cufflinks and RSEM and 30% by eXpress. Titration order consistency is correct for 47% of transcripts for Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 41% for Cufflinks and RSEM and 34% for eXpress. We, further, observe improved repeatability across laboratory sites with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 8% and 44% and reduced standard deviation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E8FD3x2evB0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Practical Bayesian Optimization for Model Fitting with Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search. (arXiv:1705.04405v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04405</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computational models in fields such as computational neuroscience are often
evaluated via stochastic simulation or numerical approximation. Fitting these
models implies a difficult optimization problem over complex, possibly noisy
parameter landscapes. Bayesian optimization (BO) has been successfully applied
to solving expensive black-box problems in engineering and machine learning.
Here we explore whether BO can be applied as a general tool for model fitting.
First, we present a novel BO algorithm, Bayesian adaptive direct search (BADS),
that achieves competitive performance with an affordable computational overhead
for the running time of typical models. We then perform an extensive benchmark
of BADS vs. many common and state-of-the-art nonconvex, derivative-free
optimizers on a set of model-fitting problems with real data and models from
six studies in behavioral, cognitive, and computational neuroscience. With
default settings, BADS consistently finds comparable or better solutions than
other methods, showing great promise for BO, and BADS in particular, as a
general model-fitting tool.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of
`big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in
biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs
to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model
parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In
this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related
problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given
observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review
applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of
neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene
regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of
controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the
statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method,
pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising
problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be
reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Neural Representation Of Personally Familiar And Unfamiliar Faces In The Distributed System For Face Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138297v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138297v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The face processing network consists of a core system, involved in the processing of visual appearance of faces, and an extended system, involved in the retrieval of person-knowledge and other nonvisual information associated with faces. Behavioral evidence shows that personally familiar faces are processed in a more robust and efficient way than unfamiliar faces. Personally familiar faces evoke a stronger activation in the extended system as compared to faces of strangers. This increased activation of the extended system may reflect aspects of familiarity that are shared by all familiar identities or enhanced representations that distinguish individual familiar identities. Here we distinguished between these two aspects of familiarity, and investigated the organization of the core and extended systems derived from similarities in neural representations. We applied multivariate pattern classification and network-level representational similarity analysis to fMRI data collected while 33 subjects viewed personally familiar faces and unfamiliar faces. Both face identity and identity-independent familiarity information could be decoded from patterns of response to faces in extended system areas. Analysis of the representational similarities in the face processing system revealed a clear distinction between core and extended systems, and a subdivision of the core system into ventral, dorsal and anterior components. This study provides evidence that patterns of activity in the extended system carry information about both individual identities and personal familiarity, while clarifying and extending the organization of the core system for face perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gravitational Signals Underlie Tonic Muscle Activity During Goal-Directed Reaching</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138263v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/138263v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Human reaching movements require complex muscle activations to produce the forces necessary to move the limb in a controlled manner. How the complex kinetic properties of the limb and gravity contribute to the generation of the muscle activation pattern by the central nervous system (CNS) is a long-standing question in neuroscience. One common theory is that the CNS reduces the redundancies and complexities of the musculoskeletal system using motor primitives. These primitives are often obtained using decomposition methods based on shared variance across multiple signals. A critique of this technique is that the dependencies that exist due to the causal relationship between muscle activations and the resulting movement are difficult to disambiguate from neural primitives inherent in control signals. In the present study addressed this critique by examining the relationships between motor primitives extracted from muscle activity, muscle torques, and other motion signals. We hypothesized that the primitives obtained from muscle activity are more similar to kinetic primitives obtained from joint torques, than kinematic primitives obtained from joint angles and angular velocity signals. Eight healthy subjects pointed in virtual reality to visual targets arranged to create a standard center-out reaching task in three dimensions. Muscle activity and motion capture data were synchronously collected during the movements. Non-negative matrix factorization was then applied to muscle activity, muscle torques, and other motion signals (joint angles, angular velocities, gravitational torques, and other inertial torques) separately to reduce the dimensionality of data. Results show that the activation profiles of all NMF components were organized sequentially and correlated highly. The scaling of NMF components obtained from EMG and kinetic and kinematic signals correlated across multiple signal types. We found closer correspondence between NMF components obtained from EMG and gravitational torques than those obtained from other torque signals or kinematic signals. Altogether, these results reject our hypothesis, suggesting that motor primitives do not consist of signals of a single modality. Our results also identify the kinetic signals for gravity compensation as the potential contributor to neural motor primitives that may be responsible for controlled transitions between arm postures during movement.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pupil Size Asymmetries Are Modulated By An Interaction Between Attentional Load And Task Experience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137893v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137893v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In a recently published study [1], we investigated how human pupil sizes are modulated by task experience as well as attentional load in a visuospatial task. In particular, participants performed a multiple object tracking (MOT) task while pupil sizes were recorded using binocular eyetracking measurements. To vary the attentional load, participants performed the MOT task either tracking zero or up to five targets. To manipulate the task experience, participants performed the MOT task on three consecutive days. We found that pupil sizes systematically increased with attentional load and decreased with additional task experience. For all these analyses, we averaged across the pupil sizes for the left and right eye. However, findings of a recent study [2] have suggested that also asymmetries in pupil sizes could be related to attentional processing. Given these findings, we further analyzed our data to investigate to what extent pupil size asymmetries are modulated by attentional load and task experience. We found a significant interaction effect between these two factors. That is, on the first day of the measurements, pupil size asymmetries were not modulated by attentional load while this was the case for the second and third day of the measurements. In particular, for the second and third day, pupil size asymmetries systematically increased with attentional load, indicating that attentional processing also modulates pupil size asymmetries. Given these results, we suggest that an increase in task experience (and associated reductions in arousal) uncover modulations in pupil size asymmetries related to attentional processing that are not observable for typical arousal levels. We suggest that these modulations could be a result of right-lateralized attentional processing in the brain that in turn influences structures involved in the control of pupil sizes such as the locus coeruleus. We can exclude a number of possible alternative explanations for this effect related to our experimental setup. Yet, given the novelty of this finding and the arguably speculative explanation of the underlying mechanisms, we suggest that future studies are needed to replicate the present effect and further investigate the underlying mechanisms.</description>

	<description>Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity.</description>

	<description>Brain dynamic changes associated with schizophrenia are largely equivocal, with interpretation complicated by many factors, such as the presence of therapeutic agents and the complex nature of the syndrome itself. Evidence for a brain-wide change in individual network oscillations, shared by all patients, is largely equivocal, but stronger for lower (delta) than for higher (gamma) bands. However, region-specific changes in rhythms across multiple, interdependent, nested frequencies may correlate better with pathology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inverse correlation processing by neurons with active dendrites</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137984v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In many neuron types, the dendrites contain a significant density of sodium channels and are capable of generating action potentials, but the significance and role of dendritic sodium spikes are unclear. Here, we use simplified computational models to investigate the functional effect of dendritic spikes. We found that one of the main features of neurons equipped with excitable dendrites is that the firing rate of the neuron measured at soma decreases with increasing input correlations, which is an inverse relation compared to passive dendrite and single-compartment models. We first show that in biophysical models the collision and annihilation of dendritic spikes causes an inverse dependence of firing rate on correlations. We then explore this in more detail using excitable dendrites modeled with integrate-and-fire type mechanisms. Finally, we show that the inverse correlation dependence can also be found in very simple models, where the dendrite is modeled as a discrete-state cellular automaton. We conclude that the cancellation of dendritic spikes is a generic mechanism that allows neurons to process correlations inversely compared to single-compartment models. This qualitative effect due to the presence of dendrites should have strong consequences at the network level, where networks of neurons with excitable dendrites may have fundamentally different properties than networks of point neuron models.</description>

	<description>Although it is well known that animals can encode the consequences of their actions and can use this information to control action selection and evaluation, it is not known what learning rules control action-outcome (AO) learning. Here we trained participants to encode specific AO associations whilst undergoing functional imaging (fMRI) and used computational modelling to evaluate competing models. This analysis revealed that a Kalman filter, which learned the unique causal effect of each action, best characterized AO learning and found the medial prefrontal cortex differentiated the unique effect of actions from background effects. We subsequently extended these findings to show that mPFC participated in a circuit with parietal cortex and caudate nucleus to segregate distinct contributions to AO learning. The results extend our understanding of goal-directed learning and demonstrate that sensitivity to the causal relationship between actions and outcomes guides goal-directed learning rather than contiguous state-action relations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mechanical Activation Of Piezo1 But Not Nav1.2 Channels By Ultrasound</title>

	<description>Ultrasound can modulate the electrical activity of the brain and other excitable tissues but the mechanisms underlying this effect are not understood, either at the molecular level or in terms of the physical modality through which ultrasound exerts its effects. An obvious approach to address this question would be to measure ultrasounds effects on specific candidate ion channels using patch-clamp recording, but ultrasound at the most commonly used frequencies permanently damages the gigaohm seals required for patch-clamp recording. Here we report an experimental system that allows for stable patch-clamp recording in the presence of ultrasound at 43 MHz, a frequency known to stimulate neural activity in tissue in vitro. We describe the effects of ultrasound on two ion channels proposed to be involved in the response of excitable cells to ultrasound: the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Our patch-clamp recordings, together with finite-element simulations of acoustic field parameters indicate that Piezo1 channels can be activated by ultrasound through cell membrane stretch and that acoustic streaming is required for this effect. Despite the reported sensitivity of voltage-gated sodium channels to membrane stretch, NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism, but their activation and inactivation rates were accelerated by ultrasound-induced heating. The approach described here will be useful in exploring the effects of different ultrasound modalities on ion channels, to better understand the endogenous response of excitable tissues to ultrasound and to help design ultrasound-sensitive channels for sonogenetic manipulation of cell activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Revisiting Chemoaffinity Theory: Chemotactic Implementation Of Topographic Axonal Projection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/136291v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neural circuits are wired by chemotactic migration of growth cones guided by extracellular guidance cue gradients. How growth cone chemotaxis builds the macroscopic structure of the neural circuit is a fundamental question in neuroscience. I addressed this issue in the case of the ordered axonal projections called topographic maps in the retinotectal system. In the retina and tectum, the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in gradients. According to chemoaffinity theory proposed by Sperry, gradients in both the source and target areas enable projecting axons to recognize their proper terminals, but how axons chemotactically decode their destinations is largely unknown. To identify the chemotactic mechanism of topographic mapping, I developed a mathematical model of intracellular signaling in the growth cone that focuses on the unique chemotactic property of the growth cone, which is being attracted or repelled by the same guidance cues in different biological situations. The model presented mechanism by which the retinal growth cone reaches the correct terminal zone in the tectum through alternating chemotactic response between attraction and repulsion around a preferred concentration. The model also provided a unified understanding of the contrasting relationships between receptor expression levels and preferred ligand concentrations in EphA/ephrinA- and EphB/ephrinB-encoded topographic mappings. Thus, this study redefines the chemoaffinity theory in chemotactic terms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Responses To Mechanically And Visually Cued Water Waves In The Nervous System Of The Medicinal Leech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137588v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Sensitivity to water waves is a key modality by which aquatic predators can detect and localize their prey. For one such predator, the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, behavioral responses to visual and mechanical cues from water waves are well documented. Here, we quantitatively characterized the response patterns of a multisensory interneuron, the S cell, to mechanically and visually cued water waves. The frequency dependence of the S-cell response matched the behavioral response well, in that sensitivity was higher for low frequencies in the visual modality and for high frequencies in the mechanical modality. We demonstrated that neither the cephalic ganglia nor the tail brain is required for the S cell to respond to visually cued water waves. The direction of spike propagation within the S-cell system did follow the direction of wave propagation under certain circumstances, but it is unlikely that downstream neuronal targets can use this information. In terms of overall firing rate, the S cell response was not direction selective. Accordingly we propose a role for the S cell in the detection of waves but not in the localization of their source.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coalescent embedding in the hyperbolic space unsupervisedly discloses the hidden geometry of the brain. (arXiv:1705.04192v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain displays a complex network topology, whose structural
organization is widely studied using diffusion tensor imaging. The original
geometry from which emerges the network topology is known, as well as the
localization of the network nodes in respect to the brain morphology and
anatomy. One of the most challenging problems of current network science is to
infer the latent geometry from the mere topology of a complex network. The
human brain structural connectome represents the perfect benchmark to test
algorithms aimed to solve this problem. Coalescent embedding was recently
designed to map a complex network in the hyperbolic space, inferring the node
angular coordinates. Here we show that this methodology is able to
unsupervisedly reconstruct the latent geometry of the brain with an incredible
accuracy and that the intrinsic geometry of the brain networks strongly relates
to the lobes organization known in neuroanatomy. Furthermore, coalescent
embedding allowed the detection of geometrical pathological changes in the
connectomes of Parkinson's Disease patients. The present study represents the
first evidence of brain networks' angular coalescence in the hyperbolic space,
opening a completely new perspective, possibly towards the realization of
latent geometry network markers for evaluation of brain disorders and
pathologies.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prominent Lateral Spread Of Imaged Evoked Activity Beyond Cortical Columns In Barrel Cortex Provides Foundation For Coding Whisker Identity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137562v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The posterior medial barrel subfield (PMBSF) of rat primary somatosensory cortex exquisitely demonstrates topography and columnar organization, defining features of sensory cortices in the mammalian brain. Optical imaging and neuronal recordings in rat PMBSF demonstrates how evoked cortical activity following single whisker stimulation also rapidly spreads laterally into surrounding cortices, disregarding columnar and modality boundaries. The current study quantifies the spatial prominence of such lateral activity spreads by demonstrating that functional connectivity between laterally spaced cortical locations is actually stronger than between vertically spaced cortical locations. Further, the total amount of evoked activity within and beyond single column boundaries was quantified based on intrinsic signal optical imaging, single units and local field potentials (LFPs) recordings, revealing that the vast majority of whisker evoked activity in PMBSF occurs beyond columnar boundaries. Finally, a simple two layer artificial neural network model of PMBSF demonstrates the capacity of extra-columnar evoked activity spread to provide a foundation for accurate whisker stimulus classification that is robust to random scaling of inputs and local noise. Indeed, classification performance improved when more of the lateral spread was included in the model, providing further evidence for the relevance of the lateral spread.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/137422v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Quadratization of biophysical (conductance-based) models having a parabolic-like voltage nullcline in the subthreshold voltage regime refers to the process by which these models are substituted by &quot;caricature&quot; models having a strictly parabolic voltage nullcline and a linear nullcline for the recovery variable. We refer to the latter as quadratic or parabolic models. The parabolic-like and strictly parabolic voltage nullclines coincide at their extrema (minima or maxima) and are well approximated by each other in vicinities of these extrema whose size depend on the model parameters. Quadratic models are simplified by a change of variables that translates these extrema into the origin of the phase-plane diagram. A further simplification (parameter reduction) can be achieved by nondimensionalizing the quadratic models. This procedure can be extended to three-dimensional models having a parabolic-cylinder-like shaped voltage nullsurface and to models having time-dependent inputs and synaptic currents.</description>

Imaging and analyzing the locomotion behavior of small animals such as Drosophila larvae or C. elegans worms has become an integral subject of biological research. In the past we have introduced FIM, a novel imaging system feasible to extract high contrast images. This system in combination with the associated tracking software FIMTrack is already used by many groups all over the world. However, so far there has not been an in-depth discussion of the technical aspects. Here we elaborate on the implementation details of FIMTrack and give an in-depth explanation of the used algorithms. Among others, the software offers several tracking strategies to cover a wide range of different model organisms, locomotion types, and camera properties. Furthermore, the software facilitates stimuli-based analysis in combination with built-in manual tracking and correction functionalities. All features are integrated in an easy-to-use graphical user interface. To demonstrate the potential of FIMTrack we provide an evaluation of its accuracy using manually labeled data. The source code is available under the GNU GPLv3 at https://github.com/i-git/FIMTrack and pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Mac are available at http://fim.uni-muenster.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RnKp9roQszY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying stochastic oscillations in single-cell live imaging time series using Gaussian processes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nick E. Phillips, Cerys Manning, Nancy Papalopulu, Magnus Rattray&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple biological processes are driven by oscillatory gene expression at different time scales. Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and single-cell live imaging of gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators. This underlies a new challenge to the experimentalist because neither intuition nor pre-existing methods work well for identifying oscillatory activity in noisy biological time series. Thus, there is an acute need for an objective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived noisy time series is periodic. Here, we present a new data analysis method that combines mechanistic stochastic modelling with the powerful methods of non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. We show that our method outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying cells as oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic oscillator model and in experimental data. Analysis of bioluminescent live-cell imaging shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by a &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; promoter (10/19), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5’ LTR (MMLV) promoter (0/25). The method can be applied to data from any gene network to both quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a population and to measure the period and quality of oscillations. It is publicly available as a MATLAB package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-1OSdE0Uj50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Can Musical Emotion Be Quantified With Neural Jitter Or Shimmer? A Novel EEG Based Study With Hindustani Classical Music. (arXiv:1705.03543v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The term jitter and shimmer has long been used in the domain of speech and
acoustic signal analysis as a parameter for speaker identification and other
prosodic features. In this study, we look forward to use the same parameters in
neural domain to identify and categorize emotional cues in different musical
clips. For this, we chose two ragas of Hindustani music which are
conventionally known to portray contrast emotions and EEG study was conducted
on 5 participants who were made to listen to 3 min clip of these two ragas with
sufficient resting period in between. The neural jitter and shimmer components
were evaluated for each experimental condition. The results reveal interesting
information regarding domain specific arousal of human brain in response to
musical stimuli and also regarding trait characteristics of an individual. This
novel study can have far reaching conclusions when it comes to modeling of
emotional appraisal. The results and implications are discussed in detail.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Variable Synaptic Strengths Controls the Firing Rate Distribution in Feedforward Neural Networks. (arXiv:1605.05335v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05335</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05335</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity of firing rate statistics is known to have severe consequences
on neural coding. Recent experimental recordings in weakly electric fish
indicate that the distribution-width of superficial pyramidal cell firing rates
(trial- and time-averaged) in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL)
depends on the stimulus, and also that network inputs can mediate changes in
the firing rate distribution across the population. We previously developed
theoretical methods to understand how two attributes (synaptic and intrinsic
heterogeneity) interact and alter the firing rate distribution in a population
of integrate-and-fire neurons with random recurrent coupling. Inspired by our
experimental data, we extend these theoretical results to a delayed feedforward
spiking network that qualitatively capture the changes of firing rate
heterogeneity observed in in-vivo recordings. We demonstrate how heterogeneous
neural attributes alter firing rate heterogeneity, accounting for the effect
with various sensory stimuli. The model predicts how the strength of the
effective network connectivity is related to intrinsic heterogeneity in such
delayed feedforward networks: the strength of the feedforward input is
positively correlated with excitability (threshold value for spiking) with low
firing rate heterogeneity and is negatively correlated with excitability with
high firing rate heterogeneity. We also show how our theory can be use to
predict effective neural architecture. We demonstrate that neural attributes do
not interact in a simple manner but rather in a complex stimulus-dependent
fashion to control neural heterogeneity and discuss how it can ultimately shape
population codes.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Short-term activity cycles impede information transmission in ant colonies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005527</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas O. Richardson, Jonas I. Liechti, Nathalie Stroeymeyt, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Laurent Keller&lt;/p&gt;

Rhythmical activity patterns are ubiquitous in nature. We study an oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on biological networks because the interactions between the component parts are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony. To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect, and present evidence in support of it.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5hhqdumyrcA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Immune-Induced Fever Is Dependent on Local But Not Generalized Prostaglandin E2 Synthesis in the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5035?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fever occurs upon binding of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to EP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, but the origin of the pyrogenic PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has not been clearly determined. Here, using mice of both sexes, we examined the role of local versus generalized PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in the brain for the febrile response. In wild-type mice and in mice with genetic deletion of the prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in the brain endothelium, generated with an inducible CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Slco1c1&lt;/i&gt; promoter, PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the CSF were only weakly related to the magnitude of the febrile response, whereas the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesizing capacity in the hypothalamus, as reflected in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA, showed strong correlation with the immune-induced fever. Histological analysis showed that the deletion of cyclooxygenase-2 in brain endothelial cells occurred preferentially in small- and medium-sized vessels deep in the brain parenchyma, such as in the hypothalamus, whereas larger vessels, and particularly those close to the neocortical surface and in the meninges, were left unaffected, hence leaving PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis largely intact in major parts of the brain while significantly reducing it in the region critical for the febrile response. Furthermore, injection of a virus vector expressing microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) into the median preoptic nucleus of fever-refractive mPGES-1 knock-out mice, resulted in a temperature elevation in response to LPS. We conclude that the febrile response is dependent on local release of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto its target neurons and not on the overall PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By using mice with selective deletion of prostaglandin synthesis in brain endothelial cells, we demonstrate that local prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production in deep brain areas, such as the hypothalamus, which is the site of thermoregulatory neurons, is critical for the febrile response to peripheral inflammation. In contrast, PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in other brain areas and the overall PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level in the brain do not influence the febrile response. Furthermore, partly restoring the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesizing capacity in the anterior hypothalamus of mice lacking such capacity with a lentiviral vector resulted in a temperature elevation in response to LPS. These data imply that the febrile response is dependent on the local release of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto its target neurons, possibly by a paracrine mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Inferotemporal Cortex Cells Use Multiple Input Pathways for Shape Encoding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5019?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5019?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the macaque monkey brain, posterior inferior temporal (PIT) cortex cells contribute to visual object recognition. They receive concurrent inputs from visual areas V4, V3, and V2. We asked how these different anatomical pathways shape PIT response properties by deactivating them while monitoring PIT activity in two male macaques. We found that cooling of V4 or V2|3 did not lead to consistent changes in population excitatory drive; however, population pattern analyses showed that V4-based pathways were more important than V2|3-based pathways. We did not find any image features that predicted decoding accuracy differences between both interventions. Using the HMAX hierarchical model of visual recognition, we found that different groups of simulated &quot;PIT&quot; units with different input histories (lacking &quot;V2|3&quot; or &quot;V4&quot; input) allowed for comparable levels of object-decoding performance and that removing a large fraction of &quot;PIT&quot; activity resulted in similar drops in performance as in the cooling experiments. We conclude that distinct input pathways to PIT relay similar types of shape information, with V1-dependent V4 cells providing more quantitatively useful information for overall encoding than cells in V2 projecting directly to PIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Convolutional neural networks are the best models of the visual system, but most emphasize input transformations across a serial hierarchy akin to the primary &quot;ventral stream&quot; (V1 -&amp;gt; V2 -&amp;gt; V4 -&amp;gt; IT). However, the ventral stream also comprises parallel &quot;bypass&quot; pathways: V1 also connects to V4, and V2 to IT. To explore the advantages of mixing long and short pathways in the macaque brain, we used cortical cooling to silence inputs to posterior IT and compared the findings with an HMAX model with parallel pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Modulation of the Pupil Light Reflex by Microstimulation of Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5008?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5008?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to flexibly regulate sensorimotor responses, perhaps through modulating activity in other circuits. However, the scope of that control remains unknown: it remains unclear whether the PFC can modulate basic reflexes. One canonical example of a central reflex is the pupil light reflex (PLR): the automatic constriction of the pupil in response to luminance increments. Unlike pupil size, which depends on the interaction of multiple physiological and neuromodulatory influences, the PLR reflects the action of a simple brainstem circuit. However, emerging behavioral evidence suggests that the PLR may be modulated by cognitive processes. Although the neural basis of these modulations remains unknown, one possible source is the PFC, particularly the frontal eye field (FEF), an area of the PFC implicated in the control of attention. We show that microstimulation of the rhesus macaque FEF alters the magnitude of the PLR in a spatially specific manner. FEF microstimulation enhanced the PLR to probes presented within the stimulated visual field, but suppressed the PLR to probes at nonoverlapping locations. The spatial specificity of this effect parallels the effect of FEF stimulation on attention and suggests that FEF is capable of modulating visuomotor transformations performed at a lower level than was previously known. These results provide evidence of the selective regulation of a basic brainstem reflex by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pupil light reflex (PLR) is our brain's first and most fundamental mechanism for light adaptation. Although it is often described in textbooks as being an immutable reflex, converging evidence suggests that the magnitude of the PLR is modulated by cognitive factors. The neural bases of these modulations are unknown. Here, we report that microstimulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulates the gain of the PLR, changing how a simple reflex circuit responds to physically identical stimuli. These results suggest that control structures such as the PFC can add complexity and flexibility to even a basic brainstem circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Spacing Effect for Structural Synaptic Plasticity Provides Specificity and Precision in Plastic Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/4992?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to trials of training without intervals (massed training), training trials spaced over time (spaced training) induce a more persistent memory identified as long-term memory (LTM). This phenomenon, known as the spacing effect for memory, is poorly understood. LTM is supported by structural synaptic plasticity; however, how synapses integrate spaced stimuli remains elusive. Here, we analyzed events of structural synaptic plasticity at the single-synapse level after distinct patterns of stimulation in motoneurons of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We found that the spacing effect is a phenomenon detected at synaptic level, which determines the specificity and the precision in structural synaptic plasticity. Whereas a single pulse of stimulation (massed) induced structural synaptic plasticity, the same amount of stimulation divided in three spaced stimuli completely prevented it. This inhibitory effect was determined by the length of the interstimulus intervals. The inhibitory effect of the spacing was lost by suppressing the activity of Ras or mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas the overexpression of Ras-WT enhanced it. Moreover, dividing the same total time of stimulation into five or more stimuli produced a higher precision in the number of events of plasticity. Ras mutations associated with intellectual disability abolished the spacing effect and led neurons to decode distinct stimulation patterns as massed stimulation. This evidence suggests that the spacing effect for memory may result from the effect of the spacing in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be a property not limited to neurons involved in learning and memory. We propose a model of spacing-dependent structural synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-term memory (LTM) induced by repeated trials spaced over time is known as the spacing effect, a common property in the animal kingdom. Altered mechanisms in the spacing effect have been found in animal models of disorders with intellectual disability, such as Noonan syndrome. Although LTM is sustained by structural synaptic plasticity, how synapses integrate spaced stimuli and decode them into specific plastic changes remains elusive. Here, we show that the spacing effect is a phenomenon detected at the synaptic level, which determines the properties of the response in structural plasticity, including precision of such response. Whereas suppressing or enhancing Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling changed how synapses decode a pattern of stimuli, a disease-related Ras allele abolished the spacing effect for plastic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Classification of Fixed Point Network Dynamics From Multiple Node Timeseries Data. (arXiv:1705.03115v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03115</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03115</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fixed point networks are dynamic networks that encode stimuli via distinct
output patterns. Although such networks are omnipresent in neural systems,
their structures are typically unknown or poorly characterized. It is therefore
valuable to use a supervised approach for resolving how a network encodes
distinct inputs of interest, and the superposition of those inputs from sampled
multiple node time series. In this paper we show that accomplishing such a task
involves finding a low-dimensional state space from supervised recordings. We
demonstrate that standard methods for dimension reduction are unable to provide
the desired functionality of optimal separation of the fixed points and
transient trajectories to them. However, the combination of dimension reduction
with selection and optimization can successfully provide such functionality.
Specifically, we propose two methods: Exclusive Threshold Reduction (ETR) and
Optimal Exclusive Threshold Reduction (OETR) for finding a basis for the
classification state space. We show that the classification space constructed
upon combination of dimension reduction optimal separation can directly
facilitate recognition of stimuli, and classify complex inputs (mixtures) into
similarity classes. We test our methodology and compare it to standard
state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset - an experimental neuronal
network (the olfactory system) that we recorded from to test these methods. We
show that our methods are capable of providing a basis for the classification
space in such network, and to perform recognition at a significantly better
rate than previously proposed approaches.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An analysis of free-recall datasets from two independent experiments allows
to identify two anomalous instances of non-monotonicity in free recall: a
maximum in the dependence of the inter-response intervals on the
serial-position lags, and a minimum in the rate of contiguous recall near the
beginning of the recall process. Both effects, it is argued, may stem from a
hierarchical search protocol in the space of memories. An elementary
random-walk model on binary strings is used to test this hypothesis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEGNet: A Compact Convolutional Network for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces. (arXiv:1611.08024v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technologies enable direct
communication between humans and computers by analyzing brain measurements,
such as electroencephalography (EEG). BCI processing typically consists of
heuristically extracting features for specific tasks, limiting the
generalizability of the BCI across tasks. Here, we asked whether we can find a
single generalized neural network architecture that can accurately classify EEG
signals in different BCI tasks. Approach: In this work we introduce EEGNet, a
compact fully convolutional network for EEG-based BCIs. We compare EEGNet to
the current state-of-the-art approach across four different BCI classification
tasks: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN),
movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR).
We fit 12 different architectures, all with the same number of parameters, to
statistically control for the effect of model size versus model performance.
Results: We show that one particular architecture performed on average the best
over all datasets, suggesting that a generic model can be used for a variety of
BCIs. We also show that EEGNet compares favorably to the current best
state-of-the-art approach for each dataset across all four datasets.
Significance: Our findings suggest that a common simplified architecture,
EEGNet, can provide robust performance across many different BCI modalities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the synchronization of fully-connected and totally excitatory
integrate and fire neural networks in presence of Gaussian white noises. Using
a large deviation principle, we prove the stability of the synchronized state
under stochastic perturbations. Then, we give a lower bound on the probability
of synchronization for networks which are not initially synchronized. This
bound shows the robustness of the emergence of synchronization in presence of
small stochastic perturbations.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CT Perfusion to Predict Response to Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24953</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24953</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess the utility of CT perfusion for selection of patients for endovascular therapy up to 18 hours after symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 min after a baseline CTP. Patients were classified as ‘target mismatch' if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as &amp;gt;50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included; mean age 66 years, median NIHSS 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy 5.2 hours. Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n=131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIH Stroke Scale (83% vs 44%, p=0.002; adjusted OR=6.6; 95% CI 2.1-20.9). This association did not differ between patients treated within 6 hrs (OR = 6.4; 95% CI 1.5-27.8) and those treated beyond 6 hrs after symptom onset (OR = 13.7; 95% CI 1.4-140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The robust association between endovascular reperfusion and good outcome among patients with the CT perfusion target mismatch profile treated up to 18 hours after symptom onset supports a randomized trial of endovascular therapy in this patient population.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To evaluate nonpublication rates among trials of new successful and unsuccessful neurological drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: ‘Licensed' drugs consisted of all novel agents receiving FDA licensure 2005 to 2012 inclusive in seven neurological disorders. ‘Stalled' drugs included all experimental agents tested in the same domains that had at least one completed phase III trial in the same timeframe but failed to receive FDA approval. Trials of these drugs were included in our sample if their primary outcome collection occurred before October 1, 2010. We determined the publication status of eligible trials using searches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;, Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, sponsor websites, and direct electronic query of trial contacts and sponsors. The primary outcome was time to journal publication (or results reporting in other media) after study completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The adjusted hazard ratio for publication was 1.79 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.67) in favour of licensed drugs. Based on the criteria for nonpublication in this report, 14,092 and 33,882 volunteers participated in unpublished trials of licensed and stalled neurological drugs, respectively. Result data were not publicly available in any form for 10% (16/163) and 46% (94/203) of trials of licensed and stalled drugs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Results of trials for stalled drugs are heavily underreported. This deprives research and care communities of evidence about pathophysiology, drug class effects, and the value of surrogate endpoints in trials. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect experienced by patients receiving treatment for cancer. Approximately 30-40% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy will develop CIPN and there is considerable variability in its severity between patients. It is often sensory-predominant with pain and can lead to long-term morbidity in survivors. The prevalence and burden of CIPN late effects will likely increase as cancer survival rates continue to improve. In this review, we discuss the approach to peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer and address the clinical phenotypes and pathomechanisms of specific neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

Normative models of human cognition often appeal to Bayesian filtering, which provides optimal online estimates of unknown or hidden states of the world, based on previous observations. However, in many cases it is necessary to optimise beliefs about sequences of states rather than just the current state. Importantly, Bayesian filtering and sequential inference strategies make different predictions about beliefs and subsequent choices, rendering them behaviourally dissociable. Taking data from a probabilistic reversal task we show that subjects’ choices provide strong evidence that they are representing short sequences of states. Between-subject measures of this implicit sequential inference strategy had a neurobiological underpinning and correlated with grey matter density in prefrontal and parietal cortex, as well as the hippocampus. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence for sequential inference in human cognition, and by exploiting between subject variation in this measure we provide pointers to its neuronal substrates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XLtyEDtEW7A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances in top-down mass spectrometry enabled identification of intact proteins, but this technology still faces challenges. For example, top-down mass spectrometry suffers from a lack of sensitivity since the ion counts for a single fragmentation event are often low. In contrast, nanopore technology is exquisitely sensitive to single intact molecules, but it has only been successfully applied to DNA sequencing, so far. Here, we explore the potential of sub-nanopores for single-molecule protein identification (SMPI) and describe an algorithm for identification of the electrical current blockade signal (nanospectrum) resulting from the translocation of a denaturated, linearly charged protein through a sub-nanopore. The analysis of identification p-values suggests that the current technology is already sufficient for matching nanospectra against small protein databases, e.g., protein identification in bacterial proteomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWPCIZAkdQ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination, we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2-year-old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of severe hypomyelination were studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes, but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 5 cases of acute heart failure (AHF) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. AHF was inaugural in 3 patients, always preceded or accompanied by signs of brainstem dysfunction; it was severe, requiring intensive care management. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypokinesis. No other cause of AHF has been found. All patients showed a new medullary lesion on brain magnetic resonance imaging. All had rapid and complete recovery of ventricular function after intravenous corticosteroids. We concluded that the cases represent a takotsubo phenomenon. Physicians should be aware of rare cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in MS relapses. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Franks, Edoardo Airoldi, Nikolai Slavov&lt;/p&gt;

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vF6zRaymzxo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Epidemiological modeling of &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;: Low stercorarian transmission and failure of host adaptive immunity explain the frequency of mixed infections in humans</title>

People living in areas with active vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease have multiple contacts with its causative agent, &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;. Reinfections by &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; are possible at least in animal models leading to lower or even hardly detectable parasitaemia. In humans, although reinfections are thought to have major public health implications by increasing the risk of chronic manifestations of the disease, there is little quantitative knowledge about their frequency and the timing of parasite re-inoculation in the course of the disease. Here, we implemented stochastic agent-based models i) to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and ii) to assess how frequent are reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease according to alternative hypotheses on the adaptive immune response following a primary infection. By using a hybrid genetic algorithm, the models were fitted to epidemiological data of Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; reach 56% in humans. To explain this percentage, the best model predicted 0.032 (0.008–0.042) annual reinfections per individual with 98.4% of them occurring in the chronic phase. In addition, the parasite escapes to the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of the events of re-inoculation. With these low annual rates, the risks of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stand around 14% (4%-18%) and 60% (21%-70%) after 5 and 30 years, with most individuals being re-infected 1–3 times overall. These low rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response. Those estimates are of particular interest for vaccine development and for our understanding of the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2z3OJKtFYUE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The decay of motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics reveals an asymmetry in the stability of motion state-dependent learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005492</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EIDcYz4LMtU/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eghbal A. Hosseini, Katrina P. Nguyen, Wilsaan M. Joiner&lt;/p&gt;

Motor adaptation paradigms provide a quantitative method to study short-term modification of motor commands. Despite the growing understanding of the role motion states (e.g., velocity) play in this form of motor learning, there is little information on the relative stability of memories based on these movement characteristics, especially in comparison to the initial adaptation. Here, we trained subjects to make reaching movements perturbed by force patterns dependent upon either limb position or velocity. Following training, subjects were exposed to a series of error-clamp trials to measure the temporal characteristics of the feedforward motor output during the decay of learning. The compensatory force patterns were largely based on the perturbation kinematic (e.g., velocity), but also showed a small contribution from the other motion kinematic (e.g., position). However, the velocity contribution in response to the position-based perturbation decayed at a slower rate than the position contribution to velocity-based training, suggesting a difference in stability. Next, we modified a previous model of motor adaptation to reflect this difference and simulated the behavior for different learning goals. We were interested in the stability of learning when the perturbations were based on different combinations of limb position or velocity that subsequently resulted in biased amounts of motion-based learning. We trained additional subjects on these combined motion-state perturbations and confirmed the predictions of the model. Specifically, we show that (1) there is a significant separation between the observed gain-space trajectories for the learning and decay of adaptation and (2) for combined motion-state perturbations, the gain associated to changes in limb position decayed at a faster rate than the velocity-dependent gain, even when the position-dependent gain at the end of training was significantly greater. Collectively, these results suggest that the state-dependent adaptation associated with movement velocity is relatively more stable than that based on position.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EIDcYz4LMtU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Background:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) reduction prolongs survival in SOD1-transgenic animal models. Pyrimethamine produces dose dependent SOD1 reduction in cell culture systems. A previous phase-1 trial showed pyrimethamine lowers SOD1 levels in leucocytes in patients with &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. This study investigated whether pyrimethamine lowered SOD1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients carrying &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations linked to ALS (fALS/SOD1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods and Study Design:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Multicenter (5 sites), open-label, 9-month duration, dose-ranging, to determine safety and efficacy of pyrimethamine to lower SOD1 levels in the CSF of FALS/SOD1. All participants underwent 3 lumbar punctures, blood draw, clinical assessment of strength, motor function, quality of life, and adverse effects assessments. SOD1 levels were measured in erythrocytes and CSF. Pyrimethamine was measured in plasma and CSF. Appel ALS, ALSFRS-R and single item McGill Quality of Life (SIS-MQoL) were measured at screening, visit 6 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We enrolled 32 patients; 24 completed 6 visits (18 weeks) and 21 completed all study visits. A linear mixed effects model showed a significant reduction in CSF SOD1 at visit 6 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a mean reduction of 13.5% (95% CI: 8.4, 18.5) and at visit 9 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a mean reduction of 10.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 15.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Pyrimethamine is safe and well tolerated in ALS. Pyrimethamine is capable of producing a significant reduction in total CSF SOD1 protein content in patients with ALS caused by different &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. Further long-term studies are warranted to assess clinical efficacy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Widespread position-specific conservation of synonymous rare codons within coding sequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005531</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie L. Chaney, Aaron Steele, Rory Carmichael, Anabel Rodriguez, Alicia T. Specht, Kim Ngo, Jun Li, Scott Emrich, Patricia L. Clark&lt;/p&gt;

Synonymous rare codons are considered to be sub-optimal for gene expression because they are translated more slowly than common codons. Yet surprisingly, many protein coding sequences include large clusters of synonymous rare codons. Rare codons at the 5’ terminus of coding sequences have been shown to increase translational efficiency. Although a general functional role for synonymous rare codons farther within coding sequences has not yet been established, several recent reports have identified rare-to-common synonymous codon substitutions that impair folding of the encoded protein. Here we test the hypothesis that although the usage frequencies of synonymous codons change from organism to organism, codon rarity will be conserved at specific positions in a set of homologous coding sequences, for example to tune translation rate without altering a protein sequence. Such conservation of rarity–rather than specific codon identity–could coordinate co-translational folding of the encoded protein. We demonstrate that many rare codon cluster positions are indeed conserved within homologous coding sequences across diverse eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal species, suggesting they result from positive selection and have a functional role. Most conserved rare codon clusters occur within rather than between conserved protein domains, challenging the view that their primary function is to facilitate co-translational folding after synthesis of an autonomous structural unit. Instead, many conserved rare codon clusters separate smaller protein structural motifs within structural domains. These smaller motifs typically fold faster than an entire domain, on a time scale more consistent with translation rate modulation by synonymous codon usage. While proteins with conserved rare codon clusters are structurally and functionally diverse, they are enriched in functions associated with organism growth and development, suggesting an important role for synonymous codon usage in organism physiology. The identification of conserved rare codon clusters advances our understanding of distinct, functional roles for otherwise synonymous codons and enables experimental testing of the impact of synonymous codon usage on the production of functional proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LTnUBqKLU7k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A systems-level model reveals that 1,2-Propanediol utilization microcompartments enhance pathway flux through intermediate sequestration</title>

The spatial organization of metabolism is common to all domains of life. Enteric and other bacteria use subcellular organelles known as bacterial microcompartments to spatially organize the metabolism of pathogenicity-relevant carbon sources, such as 1,2-propanediol. The organelles are thought to sequester a private cofactor pool, minimize the effects of toxic intermediates, and enhance flux through the encapsulated metabolic pathways. We develop a mathematical model of the function of the 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; and use it to analyze the function of the microcompartment organelles in detail. Our model makes accurate estimates of doubling times based on an optimized compartment shell permeability determined by maximizing metabolic flux in the model. The compartments function primarily to decouple cytosolic intermediate concentrations from the concentrations in the microcompartment, allowing significant enhancement in pathway flux by the generation of large concentration gradients across the microcompartment shell. We find that selective permeability of the microcompartment shell is not absolutely necessary, but is often beneficial in establishing this intermediate-trapping function. Our findings also implicate active transport of the 1,2-propanediol substrate under conditions of low external substrate concentration, and we present a mathematical bound, in terms of external 1,2-propanediol substrate concentration and diffusive rates, on when active transport of the substrate is advantageous. By allowing us to predict experimentally inaccessible aspects of microcompartment function, such as intra-microcompartment metabolite concentrations, our model presents avenues for future research and underscores the importance of carefully considering changes in external metabolite concentrations and other conditions during batch cultures. Our results also suggest that the encapsulation of heterologous pathways in bacterial microcompartments might yield significant benefits for pathway flux, as well as for toxicity mitigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LNEkJwfg_Ag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) show outstanding performance in targeted high-throughput resequencing, being the most promising approach for the accurate identification of rare variants in complex DNA samples. This approach has application in multiple areas, including cancer diagnostics, thus demanding dedicated software and algorithms. Here we introduce MAGERI, a computational pipeline that efficiently handles all caveats of UMI-based analysis to obtain high-fidelity mutation profiles and call ultra-rare variants. Using an extensive set of benchmark datasets including gold-standard biological samples with known variant frequencies, cell-free DNA from tumor patient blood samples and publicly available UMI-encoded datasets we demonstrate that our method is both robust and efficient in calling rare variants. The versatility of our software is supported by accurate results obtained for both tumor DNA and viral RNA samples in datasets prepared using three different UMI-based protocols.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f2FC_Y8VHZU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Protrusion and retraction of lamellipodia are common features of eukaryotic cell motility. As a cell migrates through its extracellular matrix (ECM), lamellipod growth increases cell-ECM contact area and enhances engagement of integrin receptors, locally amplifying ECM input to internal signaling cascades. In contrast, contraction of lamellipodia results in reduced integrin engagement that dampens the level of ECM-induced signaling. These changes in cell shape are both influenced by, and feed back onto ECM signaling. Motivated by experimental observations on melanoma cells lines (1205Lu and SBcl2) migrating on fibronectin (FN) coated topographic substrates (anisotropic post-density arrays), we probe this interplay between intracellular and ECM signaling. Experimentally, cells exhibited one of three lamellipodial dynamics: persistently polarized, random, or oscillatory, with competing lamellipodia oscillating out of phase (Park et al., 2017). Pharmacological treatments, changes in FN density, and substrate topography all affected the fraction of cells exhibiting these behaviours. We use these observations as constraints to test a sequence of hypotheses for how intracellular (GTPase) and ECM signaling jointly regulate lamellipodial dynamics. The models encoding these hypotheses are predicated on mutually antagonistic Rac-Rho signaling, Rac-mediated protrusion (via activation of Arp2/3 actin nucleation) and Rho-mediated contraction (via ROCK phosphorylation of myosin light chain), which are coupled to ECM signaling that is modulated by protrusion/contraction. By testing each model against experimental observations, we identify how the signaling layers interact to generate the diverse range of cell behaviors, and how various molecular perturbations and changes in ECM signaling modulate the fraction of cells exhibiting each. We identify several factors that play distinct but critical roles in generating the observed dynamic: (1) competition between lamellipodia for shared pools of Rac and Rho, (2) activation of RhoA by ECM signaling, and (3) feedback from lamellipodial growth or contraction to cell-ECM contact area and therefore to the ECM signaling level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0dOY9je4PeE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Top-down control of cortical gamma-band communication via pulvinar induced phase shifts in the alpha rhythm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvan Quax, Ole Jensen, Paul Tiesinga&lt;/p&gt;

Selective routing of information between cortical areas is required in order to combine different sources of information according to cognitive demand. Recent experiments have suggested that alpha band activity originating from the pulvinar coordinates this inter-areal cortical communication. Using a computer model we investigated whether top-down induced shifts in the relative alpha phase between two cortical areas could modulate cortical communication, quantified in terms of changes in gamma band coherence between them. The network model was comprised of two uni-directionally connected neuronal populations of spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. We find that the phase difference of the alpha oscillations modulating the two neuronal populations strongly affected the interregional gamma-band neuronal coherence. We confirmed that a higher gamma band coherence also resulted in more efficient transmission of spiking information between cortical areas, thereby confirming the value of gamma coherence as a proxy for cortical information transmission. In a model where both neuronal populations were connected bi-directionally, the relative alpha phase determined the directionality of communication between the populations. Our results show the feasibility of a physiological realistic mechanism for routing information in the brain based on coupled oscillations. Our model results in a set of testable predictions regarding phase shifts in alpha oscillations under different task demands requiring quantification of neuronal oscillations in different regions in e.g. attention paradigms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/alHtK1rJtLs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24922-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial pyrimidine salvage pathway, is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance. Mutations in the nuclear gene, &lt;em&gt;TK2&lt;/em&gt;, cause TK2 deficiency, which manifests predominantly in children as myopathy with mtDNA depletion. Molecular bypass therapy with the TK2 products, deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), prolongs the life span of Tk2-deficient (Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice by 2- to 3-fold. Because we observed rapid catabolism of the deoxynucleoside monophosphates to deoxythymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine (dC), we hypothesized that: (1) deoxynucleosides might be the major active agents and (2) inhibition of deoxycytidine deamination might enhance dTMP+dCMP therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24922-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test these hypotheses, we assessed two therapies in Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice: (1) dT+dC and (2) coadministration of the deaminase inhibitor, tetrahydrouridine (THU), with dTMP+dCMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24922-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed that dC+dT delayed disease onset, prolonged life span of Tk2-deficient mice and restored mtDNA copy number as well as respiratory chain enzyme activities and levels. In contrast, dCMP+dTMP+THU therapy decreased life span of Tk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared to dCMP+dTMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24922-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our studies demonstrate that deoxynucleoside substrate enhancement is a novel therapy, which may ameliorate TK2 deficiency in patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Low normal cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels predict clinical progression in nondemented subjects</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied whether continuous lower normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid β1-42 (≥640pg/ml) levels were related with rate of clinical progression in a sample of 393 nondemented memory clinic patients. Lower normal levels were associated with faster clinical progression, and this depended on baseline cognitive status (subjective cognitive decline: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05; mild cognitive impairment: HR = 0.19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .01), indicating that normal CSF amyloid levels do not exclude incident Alzheimer disease. These findings suggest that research on preclinical markers for Alzheimer disease should take the continuum of CSF amyloid β1-42 levels within the normal range into account.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Quantitative muscle ultrasound detects disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24904</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed changes in quantitative muscle ultrasound data in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and healthy controls to determine whether ultrasound can serve as a biomarker of disease progression. Two approaches were used: gray scale level (GSL), measured from the ultrasound image, and quantitative backscatter analysis (QBA), measured directly from the received echoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSL and QBA were obtained from 6 unilateral arm/leg muscles in 36 boys with DMD and 28 healthy boys (age = 2–14 years) for up to 2 years. We used a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and slope terms to compare trajectories of GSL, QBA, and functional assessments. We analyzed separately a subset of boys who initiated corticosteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to healthy boys, increasing GSL in DMD boys &amp;gt;7.0 years old was first identified at 6 months (eg, anterior forearm slope difference of 1.16 arbitrary units/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–1.94); in boys ≤ 7 years old, differences in GSL first appeared at 12 months (0.82 arbitrary units/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.075–1.565, in rectus femoris). QBA performed similarly to GSL (eg, DMD boys &amp;gt; 7 years old: 0.41dB/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01, 95% CI = 0.096–0.72, in anterior forearm at 6 months). Ultrasound identified differences earlier than functional measures including 6-minute walk and supine-to-stand tests. However, neither QBA nor GSL showed an effect of corticosteroid initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24904-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;QBA performs similarly to GSL, and both appear more sensitive than functional assessments for detecting muscle deterioration in DMD. Additional studies will be required to determine whether quantitative muscle ultrasound can detect therapeutic efficacy. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Electrical impedance myography for assessment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitive, objective, and easily applied methods for evaluating disease progression and response to therapy are needed for clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, we evaluated whether electrical impedance myography (EIM) could serve this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this nonblinded study, 36 boys with DMD and 29 age-similar healthy boys underwent multifrequency EIM measurements for up to 2 years on 6 muscles unilaterally along with functional assessments. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms was used for the analysis of multifrequency EIM values and functional measures. Seven DMD boys were initiated on corticosteroids; these data were analyzed using a piecewise linear mixed-effects model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In boys &amp;gt; 7.0 years old, a significant difference in the slope of EIM phase ratio trajectories in the upper extremity was observed by 6 months of −0.074/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.013, −0.14; at 2 years, this difference was −0.048/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% CI = −0.028, −0.068. In boys ≤ 7.0 years old, differences appeared at 6 months in gastrocnemius (EIM phase slope = −0.83 °/kHz/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, 95% CI = −0.26, −1.40). EIM outcomes showed significant differences earlier than functional tests. Initiation of corticosteroids significantly improved the slope of EIM phase ratio (0.057/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00019, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.086) and EIM phase slope (0.14 °/kHz/mo, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.013, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.25), consistent with corticosteroids' known clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24874-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EIM detects deterioration in muscles of both younger and older boys by 6 months; it also identifies the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid initiation. Because EIM is rapid to apply, painless, and requires minimal operator training, the technique deserves to be further evaluated as a biomarker in DMD clinical therapeutic trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sublethal oligodendrocyte injury: A reversible condition in multiple sclerosis?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24944</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of oligodendroglial distal processes has been identified as an early event in MS lesion development. Our objective was to further define the development of the “dying-back” oligodendrocyte lesion in situ and to model the development and potential reversibility of such responses using dissociated cultures of adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; In situ analyses were performed on glutaraldehyde-fixed thin sections of clinically acute and pathologically active cases of MS. In vitro studies were conducted using adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes challenged by metabolic stress conditions (low nutrient/glucose).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In situ analyses indicated a spectrum of myelin changes in the presence of morphologically intact oligodendrocytes; these included degeneration of the inner cytoplasmic tongue with increasing sizes of intramyelinic bleb formation that could result in radial fractures of the myelin sheath. Macrophages with ingested myelin fragments were identified only once the fragmentation was established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vitro studies indicated that oligodendrocyte process retraction that was linked to reduced glycolytic respiratory activity is reversible until a critical time point. Subsequent cell death was not linked to caspase-3 dependent programs. Gene expression studies conducted at the latest reversible time point revealed reduced expression of pathways associated with cell process outgrowth and myelination, as well as with metabolic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings reveal the potential to protect and possibly restore myelin elaborated by existent oligodendrocytes in early and evolving MS lesions, and suggest the necessity of ongoing studies on the mechanisms underlying subsequent adult human oligodendrocyte cell death.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: STN-DBS is neuroprotective in the A53T α-synuclein Parkinson's disease rat model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24947</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24947</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a highly effective symptomatic therapy for motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). An additional, disease-modifying effect has been suspected from studies in toxin-based PD animal models, but these models do not reflect the molecular pathology and progressive nature of PD, that would be required to evaluate a disease-modifying action. Defining a disease-modifying effect, could radically change the way in which DBS is used in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We applied STN-DBS in an AAV1/2-driven human mutated A53T α-synuclein (aSyn)-overexpressing PD rat model (AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn). Rats were injected unilaterally, in the substantia nigra (SN), with AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn or control vector. Three weeks later, after behavioural and nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficits had developed, rats underwent STN-DBS electrode implantation ipsilateral to the vector-injected SN. Stimulation lasted for three weeks. Control groups remained OFF stimulation. Animals were sacrificed at six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Motor performance in the single pellet reaching task was impaired in the AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn injected stim-OFF group, six weeks after AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn injection, compared to pre-operative levels (-82%, P&amp;lt;0.01). Deficits were reversed in AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn, stim-ON rats after three weeks of active stimulation, compared to the AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn stim-OFF rats (an increase of ∼400%, P&amp;lt;0.05), demonstrating a beneficial effect of DBS. This motor improvement was maintained when the stimulation was turned off and was accompanied by a higher number of TH+ SN neurons (increase of ∼29%), compared to AAV1/2-A53T-aSyn stim-OFF rats (P&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Our data support the putative neuroprotective and disease-modifying effect of STN-DBS in a mechanistically-relevant model of PD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Early prediction of coma recovery after cardiac arrest with blinded pupillometry</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prognostication studies on comatose cardiac arrest (CA) patients are limited by lack of blinding, potentially causing overestimation of outcome predictors and self-fulfilling prophecy. Using a blinded approach, we analysed the value of quantitative automated pupillometry to predict neurological recovery after CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a prospective cohort of 103 comatose adult patients who were unconscious 48 hours after CA and underwent repeated measurements of quantitative pupillary light reflex (PLR) using the Neurolight-Algiscan® device. Clinical examination, electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) were performed in parallel, as part of standard multimodal assessment. Automated pupillometry results were blinded to clinicians involved in patient care. Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) at 1 year was the outcome endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors (n=50 patients; 32 CPC 1, 16 CPC 2, 2 CPC 3) had higher quantitative PLR (median 20 [range 13-41] vs. 11 [0-55] %, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and constriction velocity (1.46 [0.85-4.63] vs. 0.94 [0.16-4.97] mm/sec, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) than non-survivors. At 48 hours, a quantitative PLR &amp;lt;13% had 100% specificity and positive predictive value to predict poor recovery (0% false-positive rate), and provided equal performance than that of EEG and SSEP. Reduced quantitative PLR correlated with higher serum neuron specific enolase (Spearman's &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; -0.52, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced quantitative PLR correlates with post-anoxic brain injury and, when compared to standard multimodal assessment, is highly accurate in predicting long-term prognosis after CA. This is the first prognostication study to show the value of automated pupillometry using a blinded approach to minimize self-fulfilling prophecy. This article is protected by copyright.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Guy A Orban&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study combines monkey behavioral testing with electrical stimulation of face patches, located with functional MRI and studied electrophysiologically, to probe the behavioral relevance of the face patches' selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Matthew I Becker &amp;amp; Abigail L Person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical advances in calcium imaging enable the first tests of classic theories of cerebellar learning. Two independent groups reveal dense representation of surprising modalities in cerebellar granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Dennis J Selkoe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is present at high levels in all neurons and their synapses. We now learn that this protein helps dilate the fusion pore, which forms transiently during vesicle exocytosis, promoting release of certain neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author: Jessica A Filosa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capillary endothelial cells sense neuronal activity-evoked increases in extracellular K+ via KIR2.1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The ensuing hyperpolarization travels upstream along the vascular network, reaching arterioles and evoking vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new studies provide new tools for examining mechanisms of plasticity in dendrites. Tang and Yasuda developed new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase A (PKA), which are implicated in synaptic plasticity, primarily by replacing the fluorophore &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult. Yu et al. found that they could socially transmit scratching to mice by allowing them to watch mice with chronic itch. The observer mice showed upregulated neuronal activity &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal injuries can trigger a process of axonal disintegration known as Wallerian degeneration, which is thought to be largely driven by intrinsic mechanisms in the axon. Here, knocking out the death receptor 6 (Dr6) gene in cultured mouse sympathetic or dorsal root ganglion &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Ulman Lindenberger, Elisabeth Wenger &amp;amp; Martin Lövdén&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been told that 'brain training' will make them not only better at playing certain games but smarter in general. However, evidence indicates that brain plasticity is specific to the acquired skill. The search for neural mechanisms of transfer of training-induced benefits needs to build on this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Brie Wamsley &amp;amp; Gord Fishell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper construction of neural circuits requires the generation of diverse cell types, their distribution to defined regions, and their specific and appropriate wiring. A major objective in neurobiology has been to understand the molecular determinants that link neural birth to terminal specification and functional &lt;/p&gt;
