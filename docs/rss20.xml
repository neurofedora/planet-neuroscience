                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Neuroinflammation Induced by Lipopolysaccharide Injection into the Third Ventricle Induces Behavioral Changes</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1-40/42&lt;/sub&gt; in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Photobiomodulation Promotes Neuronal Axon Regeneration After Oxidative Stress and Induces a Change in Polarization from M1 to M2 in Macrophages via Stimulation of CCL2 in Neurons: Relevance to Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; irradiation area, 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 440 s). About 100 μM H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Behçet syndrome (BS) is a vasculitis characterized by several clinical manifestations including the rare neurological involvement (neuro-BS, NBS). The aim of our pivotal study was to investigate the mutational status of several inflammation-related genes in a cohort of Italian patients with and without the neurological involvement (20 NBS vs 40 no-NBS patients). The preliminary &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and primer design were performed by NCBI Primer-Blast tool. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR. PCR amplicons were sequenced and bioinformatically analysed. Twelve tagSNPs were selected and genotyped: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187, rs17482078, and rs27044; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL10 rs1800872&lt;/em&gt; and rs1518111, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12A&lt;/em&gt; rs17810546, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12RB2&lt;/em&gt; rs924080, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STAT4&lt;/em&gt; rs7572482, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCR1&lt;/em&gt; rs7616215, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLRC4&lt;/em&gt; rs2617170, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;UBAC2&lt;/em&gt; rs3825427.&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs showed statistically significant higher frequencies in NBS group than no-NBS. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187 AA was more common in no-NBS patients (20.0% NBS vs 47.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while rs17482078 GA frequency was higher in NBS patients (55.0% NBS vs 22.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, OR: 4.21). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018 GG was more frequent in NBS group (65.0% NBS vs 40.0% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), according to a previous finding. No other statistically significant differences were found. In conclusion, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs were found associated with neurological involvement of BS. Additional and larger analyses were required to verify our preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cypermethrin Induces the Activation of Rat Primary Microglia and Expression of Inflammatory Proteins</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: L-3-n-Butylphthalide Effectively Improves the Glymphatic Clearance and Reduce Amyloid-β Deposition in Alzheimer’s Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7&quot;&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: LncRNA H19 Regulates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Apoptosis and Inflammation of BV2 Microglia Cells Through Targeting miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 Axis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Exosomal miR-146a Is Involved in Altered Expression of Alzheimer’s Risk Genes Via Suppression of TLR4 Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01750-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Circ-VPS18 Knockdown Enhances TMZ Sensitivity and Inhibits Glioma Progression by MiR-370/RUNX1 Axis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: TNFAIP1 Is Upregulated in APP/PS1 Mice and Promotes Apoptosis in SH-SY5Y Cells by Binding to RhoB</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt;-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions. We compared the expression levels &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IFN-γ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; cytokines in blood specimens of patients with migraine and those of healthy persons to identify any possible dysregulation in their expression and to propose mechanisms for this disorder. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;INF-γ&lt;/em&gt; was suggestively higher in migraine cases than in healthy individuals (posterior beta = 0.35, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.017). In addition, expression of this cytokine was lower in female subjects than in male subjects (posterior beta = −0.712, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.012). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; was also higher in cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 1.34, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.04; posterior beta = 0.849, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.036; posterior beta = 0.451, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.042, respectively). On the other hand, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt; expression was lower in migraine cases than in controls (posterior beta = −0.78, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.039). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-1B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt; were not meaningfully different between cases and controls. The current study highlights the dysregulation of cytokine-coding genes in the blood of patients with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &amp;gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Two Cases of Female Chinese Adult-Onset Krabbe Disease with One Novel Mutation and a Review of Literature</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &amp;gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &amp;gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: LncRNA Neat1 Promotes Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury by Targeting miR-29b</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01740-3</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01740-3</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Serum Progesterone and Testosterone Levels in Schizophrenia Patients at Different Stages of Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Systems Level Molecular Signatures from Glioblastoma Multiforme Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Changes in Appetite Regulation-Related Signaling Pathways in the Brain of Mice Supplemented with Non-nutritive Sweeteners</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01737-y</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(18F-FDG) reveals metabolic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) at a
systemic level. Previous metabolic connectome studies derived from groups of
patients have failed to identify the individual neurophysiological details. We
aim to establish an individual metabolic connectome method to characterize the
aberrant connectivity patterns and topological alterations of the
individual-level brain metabolic connectome and their diagnostic value in PD.
Methods: The 18F-FDG PET data of 49 PD patients and 49 healthy controls (HCs)
were recruited. Each individual's metabolic brain network was ascertained using
the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Similarity Estimation (JSSE) method. The
intergroup difference of the individual's metabolic brain network and its
global and local graph metrics were analyzed to investigate the metabolic
connectome's alterations. The identification of the PD from HC individuals was
used by the multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) to combine the
information from connection and topological metrics. The validation was
conducted using the nest leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to confirm the
performance of the methods. Results: The proposed JSSE metabolic connectome
method showed the most involved metabolic motor networks were PUT-PCG, THA-PCG,
and SMA pathways in PD, which was similar to the typical group-level method,
and yielded another detailed individual pathological connectivity in ACG-PCL,
DCG-PHG and ACG pathways. These aberrant functional network measures exhibited
an ideal classification performance in the identifying of PD individuals from
HC individuals at an accuracy of up to 91.84%.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Performance evaluation results of evolutionary clustering algorithm star for clustering heterogeneous datasets. (arXiv:2105.02810v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article presents the data used to evaluate the performance of
evolutionary clustering algorithm star (ECA*) compared to five traditional and
modern clustering algorithms. Two experimental methods are employed to examine
the performance of ECA* against genetic algorithm for clustering++
(GENCLUST++), learning vector quantisation (LVQ) , expectation maximisation
(EM) , K-means++ (KM++) and K-means (KM). These algorithms are applied to 32
heterogenous and multi-featured datasets to determine which one performs well
on the three tests. For one, ther paper examines the efficiency of ECA* in
contradiction of its corresponding algorithms using clustering evaluation
measures. These validation criteria are objective function and cluster quality
measures. For another, it suggests a performance rating framework to measurethe
the performance sensitivity of these algorithms on varos dataset features
(cluster dimensionality, number of clusters, cluster overlap, cluster shape and
cluster structure). The contributions of these experiments are two-folds: (i)
ECA* exceeds its counterpart aloriths in ability to find out the right cluster
number; (ii) ECA* is less sensitive towards dataset features compared to its
competitive techniques. Nonetheless, the results of the experiments performed
demonstrate some limitations in the ECA*: (i) ECA* is not fully applied based
on the premise that no prior knowledge exists; (ii) Adapting and utilising ECA*
on several real applications has not been achieved yet.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Izhikevich-Inspired Optoelectronic Neurons with Excitatory and Inhibitory Inputs for Energy-Efficient Photonic Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2105.02809v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We designed, prototyped, and experimentally demonstrated, for the first time
to our knowledge, an optoelectronic spiking neuron inspired by the Izhikevich
model incorporating both excitatory and inhibitory optical spiking inputs and
producing optical spiking outputs accordingly. The optoelectronic neurons
consist of three transistors acting as electrical spiking circuits, a
vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) for optical spiking outputs, and
two photodetectors for excitatory and inhibitory optical spiking inputs.
Additional inclusion of capacitors and resistors complete the
Izhikevich-inspired optoelectronic neurons, which receive excitatory and
inhibitory optical spikes as inputs from other optoelectronic neurons. We
developed a detailed optoelectronic neuron model in Verilog-A and simulated the
circuit-level operation of various cases with excitatory input and inhibitory
input signals. The experimental results closely resemble the simulated results
and demonstrate how the excitatory inputs trigger the optical spiking outputs
while the inhibitory inputs suppress the outputs. Utilizing the simulated
neuron model, we conducted simulations using fully connected (FC) and
convolutional neural networks (CNN). The simulation results using MNIST
handwritten digits recognition show 90% accuracy on unsupervised learning and
97% accuracy on a supervised modified FC neural network. We further designed a
nanoscale optoelectronic neuron utilizing quantum impedance conversion where a
200 aJ/spike input can trigger the output from on-chip nanolasers with 10
fJ/spike. The nanoscale neuron can support a fanout of ~80 or overcome 19 dB
excess optical loss while running at 10 GSpikes/second in the neural network,
which corresponds to 100x throughput and 1000x energy-efficiency improvement
compared to state-of-art electrical neuromorphic hardware such as Loihi and
NeuroGrid.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Targeted electrical stimulation of the brain perturbs neural networks and
modulates their rhythmic activity both at the site of stimulation and at remote
brain regions. Understanding, or even predicting, this neuromodulatory effect
is crucial for any therapeutic use of brain stimulation. To this end, we
analysed the stimulation responses in 131 stimulation sessions across 66
patients with focal epilepsy recorded through intracranial EEG (iEEG). We
considered functional and structural connectivity features as predictors of the
response at every iEEG contact. Taking advantage of multiple recordings over
days, we also investigated how slow changes in interictal functional
connectivity (FC) ahead of the stimulation relate to stimulation responses. The
results reveal that, indeed, this long-term variability of FC exhibits strong
association with the stimulation-induced increases in delta and theta band
power. Furthermore, we show through cross-validation that long-term variability
of FC improves prediction of responses above the performance of spatial
predictors alone. These findings can enhance the patient-specific design of
effective neuromodulatory protocols for therapeutic interventions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose LGG, a neurologically inspired graph neural
network, to learn local-global-graph representations from
Electroencephalography (EEG) for a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). A temporal
convolutional layer with multi-scale 1D convolutional kernels and kernel-level
attention fusion is proposed to learn the temporal dynamics of EEG. Inspired by
neurological knowledge of cognitive processes in the brain, we propose local
and global graph-filtering layers to learn the brain activities within and
between different functional areas of the brain to model the complex relations
among them during the cognitive processes. Under the robust nested
cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on the publicly
available dataset DEAP, and the classification performance is compared with
state-of-the-art methods, such as FBFgMDM, FBTSC, Unsupervised learning,
DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, and TSception. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms all these state-of-the-art methods, and the
improvements are statistically significant (p&amp;lt;0.05) in most cases. The source

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Modeling the geospatial evolution of COVID-19 using spatio-temporal convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural networks. (arXiv:2105.02752v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Europe was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and Portugal was one of the most
affected countries, having suffered three waves in the first twelve months.
Approximately between Jan 19th and Feb 5th 2021 Portugal was the country in the
world with the largest incidence rate, with 14-days incidence rates per 100,000
inhabitants in excess of 1000. Despite its importance, accurate prediction of
the geospatial evolution of COVID-19 remains a challenge, since existing
analytical methods fail to capture the complex dynamics that result from both
the contagion within a region and the spreading of the infection from infected
neighboring regions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a previously developed methodology and official municipality level
data from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health (DGS), relative to the
first twelve months of the pandemic, to compute an estimate of the incidence
rate in each location of mainland Portugal. The resulting sequence of incidence
rate maps was then used as a gold standard to test the effectiveness of
different approaches in the prediction of the spatial-temporal evolution of the
incidence rate. Four different methods were tested: a simple cell level
autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, a cell level vector autoregressive
(VAR) model, a municipality-by-municipality compartmental SIRD model followed
by direct block sequential simulation and a convolutional sequence-to-sequence
neural network model based on the STConvS2S architecture. We conclude that the
convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network is the best performing
method, when predicting the medium-term future incidence rate, using the
available information.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Noether's Learning Dynamics: The Role of Kinetic Symmetry Breaking in Deep Learning. (arXiv:2105.02716v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02716</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02716</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In nature, symmetry governs regularities, while symmetry breaking brings
texture. Here, we reveal a novel role of symmetry breaking behind efficiency
and stability in learning, a critical issue in machine learning. Recent
experiments suggest that the symmetry of the loss function is closely related
to the learning performance. This raises a fundamental question. Is such
symmetry beneficial, harmful, or irrelevant to the success of learning? Here,
we demystify this question and pose symmetry breaking as a new design principle
by considering the symmetry of the learning rule in addition to the loss
function. We model the discrete learning dynamics using a continuous-time
Lagrangian formulation, in which the learning rule corresponds to the kinetic
energy and the loss function corresponds to the potential energy. We identify
kinetic asymmetry unique to learning systems, where the kinetic energy often
does not have the same symmetry as the potential (loss) function reflecting the
non-physical symmetries of the loss function and the non-Euclidean metric used
in learning rules. We generalize Noether's theorem known in physics to
explicitly take into account this kinetic asymmetry and derive the resulting
motion of the Noether charge. Finally, we apply our theory to modern deep
networks with normalization layers and reveal a mechanism of implicit adaptive
optimization induced by the kinetic symmetry breaking.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A two-module, feedforward neural network architecture called mapper-coach
network has been introduced to reconstruct an unobserved, continuous latent
variable input, driving two observed dynamical systems. The method has been
demonstrated on time series generated by two chaotic logistic maps driven by a
hidden third one. The network has been trained to predict one of the observed
time series based on its own past and on the other observed time series by
error-back propagation. It was shown, that after this prediction have been
learned successfully, the activity of the bottleneck neuron, connecting the
mapper and the coach module, correlates strongly with the latent common input
variable. The method has the potential to reveal hidden components of dynamical
systems, where experimental intervention is not possible.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Humans can flexibly modify their walking patterns. A split-belt treadmill has been widely used to study locomotor adaptation. Although previous studies have examined in detail the time-series changes in the spatiotemporal characteristics of walking during and after split-belt walking, it is not clear how intramuscular coherence changes during and after split-belt walking. We thus investigated the time-series changes of intramuscular coherence in the ankle dorsiflexor muscle associated with split-belt locomotor adaptation by coherence analysis using paired electromyography (EMG) signals. Twelve healthy males walked on a split-belt treadmill. Surface EMG signals were recorded from two parts of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in both legs to calculate intramuscular coherence. Each area of intramuscular coherence in the beta and gamma bands in the slow leg gradually decreased during split-belt walking. Significant differences in the area were observed from 7 min compared to the first minute after the start of split-belt walking. Meanwhile, the area of coherence in both beta and gamma bands in the fast leg for the first minute of normal walking following split-belt walking was significantly increased compared with normal walking before split-belt walking, and then immediately returned to the normal walking level. These results suggest that cortical involvement in TA muscle activity gradually weakens when adapting from a normal walking pattern to a new walking pattern. On the other hand, when re-adapting from the newly adapted walking pattern to the normal walking pattern, cortical involvement might strengthen temporally and then weaken quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The regulation of microRNA (miRNA) is closely related to methamphetamine (METH) addiction. Past studies have reported that miR-181a is associated with METH addiction, but the mechanism pathways remain elusive. On the basis of our past studies, which reported the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) mediated ubiquitin protein degradation of GABAAα1, which was involved in METH addiction. The present study, using qRT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis, further revealed that miR-181a may be indirectly responsible for the METH addiction and downregulation of GABAAα1 through the regulation of ERAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Advanced Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Along With Machine Learning Provides New Sensitive Measures of Tissue Pathology and Intra-Lesion Activity in Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tissue pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly complex, requiring multi-dimensional analysis. In this study, our goal was to test the feasibility of obtaining high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) metrics through single-shell modeling of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and investigate how advanced measures from single-shell HARDI and DTI tractography perform relative to classical DTI metrics in assessing MS pathology. We examined 52 relapsing-remitting MS patients who had 3T anatomical brain MRI and DTI. Single-shell HARDI modeling yielded 5 sub-voxel-based metrics, totalling 11 diffusion measures including 4 DTI and 2 tractography metrics. Based on machine learning of 3-dimensional regions of interest, we evaluated the importance of the measures through several tissue classification tasks. These included two within-subject comparisons: lesion versus normal appearing white matter (NAWM); and lesion core versus shell. Further, by stratifying patients as having high (above 75%&lt;sup&gt;ile&lt;/sup&gt;) and low (below 25%&lt;sup&gt;ile&lt;/sup&gt;) number of MS lesions, we also performed 2 classifications between subjects for lesions and NAWM respectively. Results showed that in lesion-NAWM analysis, HARDI orientation distribution function (ODF) energy, DTI fractional anisotropy (FA), and HARDI orientation dispersion index were the top three metrics, which together achieved 65.2% accuracy and 0.71 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In core-shell analysis, DTI mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity, and FA were the top three metrics, and MD dominated the classification, which achieved 59.3% accuracy and 0.59 AUROC alone. Between patients, FA was the leading feature in lesion comparisons, while ODF energy was the best in NAWM separation. Collectively, single-shell modeling of common diffusion data can provide robust orientation measures of lesion and NAWM pathology, and DTI metrics are most sensitive to intra-lesion abnormality. Combined analysis of both advanced and classical diffusion measures may be critical for improved understanding of MS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Framework for the Classification of Emotions in People With Visual Disabilities Through Brain Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.642766</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the recognition of emotions in people with sensory disabilities still represents a challenge due to the difficulty of generalizing and modeling the set of brain signals. In recent years, the technology that has been used to study a person’s behavior and emotions based on brain signals is the brain–computer interface (BCI). Although previous works have already proposed the classification of emotions in people with sensory disabilities using machine learning techniques, a model of recognition of emotions in people with visual disabilities has not yet been evaluated. Consequently, in this work, the authors present a twofold framework focused on people with visual disabilities. Firstly, auditory stimuli have been used, and a component of acquisition and extraction of brain signals has been defined. Secondly, analysis techniques for the modeling of emotions have been developed, and machine learning models for the classification of emotions have been defined. Based on the results, the algorithm with the best performance in the validation is random forest (RF), with an accuracy of 85 and 88% in the classification for negative and positive emotions, respectively. According to the results, the framework is able to classify positive and negative emotions, but the experimentation performed also shows that the framework performance depends on the number of features in the dataset and the quality of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a determining factor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A New Statistical Approach for fNIRS Hyperscanning to Predict Brain Activity of Preschoolers’ Using Teacher’s</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperscanning studies using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been performed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying human-human interactions. In this study, we propose a novel methodological approach that is developed for fNIRS multi-brain analysis. Our method uses support vector regression (SVR) to predict one brain activity time series using another as the predictor. We applied the proposed methodology to explore the teacher-student interaction, which plays a critical role in the formal learning process. In an illustrative application, we collected fNIRS data of the teacher and preschoolers’ dyads performing an interaction task. The teacher explained to the child how to add two numbers in the context of a game. The Prefrontal cortex and temporal-parietal junction of both teacher and student were recorded. A multivariate regression model was built for each channel in each dyad, with the student’s signal as the response variable and the teacher’s ones as the predictors. We compared the predictions of SVR with the conventional ordinary least square (OLS) predictor. The results predicted by the SVR model were statistically significantly correlated with the actual test data at least one channel-pair for all dyads. Overall, 29/90 channel-pairs across the five dyads (18 channels 5 dyads = 90 channel-pairs) presented significant signal predictions withthe SVR approach. The conventional OLS resulted in only 4 out of 90 valid predictions. These results demonstrated that the SVR could be used to perform channel-wise predictions across individuals, and the teachers’ cortical activity can be used to predict the student brain hemodynamic response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Homeostatic Depression Shows Heightened Sensitivity to Synaptic Calcium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.618393</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.618393</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapses and circuits rely on homeostatic forms of regulation in order to transmit meaningful information. The Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well-studied synapse that shows robust homeostatic control of function. Most prior studies of homeostatic plasticity at the NMJ have centered on presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). PHP happens when postsynaptic muscle neurotransmitter receptors are impaired, triggering retrograde signaling that causes an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. As a result, normal levels of evoked excitation are maintained. The counterpart to PHP at the NMJ is presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD). Overexpression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) causes an increase in the amplitude of spontaneous events. PHD happens when the synapse responds to the challenge by decreasing quantal content (QC) during evoked neurotransmission—again, resulting in normal levels of postsynaptic excitation. We hypothesized that there may exist a class of molecules that affects both PHP and PHD. Impairment of any such molecule could hurt a synapse’s ability to respond to any significant homeostatic challenge. We conducted an electrophysiology-based screen for blocks of PHD. We did not observe a block of PHD in the genetic conditions screened, but we found loss-of-function conditions that led to a substantial deficit in evoked amplitude when combined with VGlut overexpression. The conditions causing this phenotype included a double heterozygous loss-of-function condition for genes encoding the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R —itpr) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and RyRs gate calcium release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological agents targeting IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R and RyR recapitulated the genetic losses of these factors, as did lowering calcium levels from other sources. Our data are consistent with the idea that the homeostatic signaling process underlying PHD is especially sensitive to levels of calcium at the presynapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Probiotic Supplementation Facilitates Recovery of 6-OHDA-Induced Motor Deficit via Improving Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive impairment of motor and non-motor functions in aging people. Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>In multicellular organisms, sexual reproduction requires the separation of the germline from the soma. In flowering plants, the female germline precursor differentiates as a single spore mother cell (SMC) as the ovule primordium forms. Here, we explored how organ growth contributes to SMC differentiation. We generated 92 annotated 3D images at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis. We identified the spatio-temporal pattern of cell division that acts in a domain-specific manner as the primordium forms. Tissue growth models uncovered plausible morphogenetic principles involving a spatially confined growth signal, differential mechanical properties, and cell growth anisotropy. Our analysis revealed that SMC characteristics first arise in more than one cell but SMC fate becomes progressively restricted to a single cell during organ growth. Altered primordium geometry coincided with a delay in the fate restriction process in &lt;i&gt;katanin&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Altogether, our study suggests that tissue geometry channels reproductive cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule primordium.</description>

	<description>Incision causes neuronal sensitization and acute postoperative pain. After injury resolves, endogenous µ‐opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suppresses latent pain sensitization. Inhibiting MOR signaling, either systemically or within the CeA, unmasks latent sensitization, leading to reinstatement of hypersensitivity.
​

Abstract
Tissue injury induces a long‐lasting latent sensitization (LS) of spinal nociceptive signaling that is kept in remission by an opposing µ‐opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity. To test the hypothesis that supraspinal sites become engaged, we induced hindpaw inflammation, waited 3 weeks for mechanical hypersensitivity to resolve, and then injected the opioid receptor inhibitors naltrexone, CTOP or β‐funaltrexamine subcutaneously, and/or into the cerebral ventricles. Intracerebroventricular injection of each inhibitor reinstated hypersensitivity and produced somatic signs of withdrawal, indicative of LS and endogenous opioid dependence, respectively. In naïve or sham controls, systemic naloxone (3 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion, and systemic naltrexone (3 mg/kg) increased Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In LS animals tested 3 weeks after plantar incision, systemic naltrexone reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity and produced an even greater increase in Fos than in sham controls, particularly in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA. One third of Fos+ profiles co‐expressed protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), and 35% of PKCδ neurons co‐expressed tdTomato+ in Oprm1Cre::tdTomato transgenic mice. CeA microinjection of naltrexone (1 µg) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity only in male mice and did not produce signs of somatic withdrawal. Intra‐CeA injection of the MOR‐selective inhibitor CTAP (300 ng) reinstated hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. We conclude that MORs in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA prevent the transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.</description>

In the past few years, a wealth of sample-specific network construction methods and structural network control methods has been proposed to identify sample-specific driver nodes for supporting the Sample-Specific network Control (SSC) analysis of biological networked systems. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation for these state-of-the-art methods. Here, we conducted a performance assessment for 16 SSC analysis workflows by using the combination of 4 sample-specific network reconstruction methods and 4 representative structural control methods. This study includes simulation evaluation of representative biological networks, personalized driver genes prioritization on multiple cancer bulk expression datasets with matched patient samples from TCGA, and cell marker genes and key time point identification related to cell differentiation on single-cell RNA-seq datasets. By widely comparing analysis of existing SSC analysis workflows, we provided the following recommendations and banchmarking workflows. (i) The performance of a network control method is strongly dependent on the up-stream sample-specific network method, and Cell-Specific Network construction (CSN) method and Single-Sample Network (SSN) method are the preferred sample-specific network construction methods. (ii) After constructing the sample-specific networks, the undirected network-based control methods are more effective than the directed network-based control methods. In addition, these data and evaluation pipeline are freely available on https://github.com/WilfongGuo/Benchmark_control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YjYKAypUMRk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the year 2020, there were 105 different statutory insurance companies in Germany with heterogeneous regional coverage. Obtaining data from all insurance companies is challenging, so that it is likely that projects will have to rely on data not covering the whole population. Consequently, the study of epidemic spread in hospital referral networks using data-driven models may be biased. We studied this bias using data from three German regional insurance companies covering four federal states: AOK (historically “general local health insurance company”, but currently only the abbreviation is used) Lower Saxony (in Federal State of Lower Saxony), AOK Bavaria (in Bavaria), and AOK PLUS (in Thuringia and Saxony). To understand how incomplete data influence network characteristics and related epidemic simulations, we created sampled datasets by randomly dropping a proportion of patients from the full datasets and replacing them with random copies of the remaining patients to obtain scale-up datasets to the original size. For the sampled and scale-up datasets, we calculated several commonly used network measures, and compared them to those derived from the original data. We found that the network measures (degree, strength and closeness) were rather sensitive to incompleteness. Infection prevalence as an outcome from the applied susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model was fairly robust against incompleteness. At incompleteness levels as high as 90% of the original datasets the prevalence estimation bias was below 5% in scale-up datasets. Consequently, a coverage as low as 10% of the local population of the federal state population was sufficient to maintain the relative bias in prevalence below 10% for a wide range of transmission parameters as encountered in clinical settings.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction as a regulator of alveolar-capillary oxygen flux: A computational model of ventilation-perfusion matching</title>

The relationship between regional variabilities in airflow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) is a critical determinant of gas exchange efficiency in the lungs. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is understood to be the primary active regulator of ventilation-perfusion matching, where upstream arterioles constrict to direct blood flow away from areas that have low oxygen supply. However, it is not understood how the integrated action of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction affects oxygen transport at the system level. In this study we develop, and make functional predictions with a multi-scale multi-physics model of ventilation-perfusion matching governed by the mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Our model consists of (a) morphometrically realistic 2D pulmonary vascular networks to the level of large arterioles and venules; (b) a tileable lumped-parameter model of vascular fluid and wall mechanics that accounts for the influence of alveolar pressure; (c) oxygen transport accounting for oxygen bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in plasma; and (d) a novel empirical model of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Our model simulations predict that under the artificial test condition of a uniform ventilation distribution (1) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction matches perfusion to ventilation; (2) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction homogenizes regional alveolar-capillary oxygen flux; and (3) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction increases whole-lobe oxygen uptake by improving ventilation-perfusion matching.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zk2hOAYLl-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted our vulnerability to novel infections.
Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission—successfully reducing the reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iLQxZVEzKNg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Understanding brain operation demands linking basic behavioral traits to cell-type specific dynamics of different brain-wide subcircuits. This requires a system to classify the basic operational modes of neurons and circuits. Single-cell phenotyping of firing behavior during ongoing oscillations in vivo has provided a large body of evidence on entorhinal–hippocampal function, but data are dispersed and diverse. Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in Hippocampome.org. We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data. By confronting the effect of brain state and recording methods, we highlight the equivalences and differences across conditions and offer a number of novel observations. We show how a heuristic approach based on oscillatory features of morphologically identified neurons can aid in classifying extracellular recordings of single cells and discuss future opportunities and challenges towards integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6XJULtpQ37M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The synaptic inputs and thalamic projections of two classes of layer 6 corticothalamic neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of the mouse</title>

	<description>Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6 CThNs) in primary somatosensory cortex of the rodent are morphologically diverse. This study shows that one class of L6 CThNs receives more widespread presynaptic inputs than the other and projects to different regions of the thalamic reticular nucleus, suggesting that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in somatosensory cortex.







Abstract
Although corticothalamic neurons (CThNs) represent the largest source of synaptic input to thalamic neurons, their role in regulating thalamocortical interactions remains incompletely understood. CThNs in sensory cortex have historically been divided into two types, those with cell bodies in Layer 6 (L6) that project back to primary sensory thalamic nuclei and those with cell bodies in Layer 5 (L5) that project to higher‐order thalamic nuclei and subcortical structures. Recently, diversity among L6 CThNs has increasingly been appreciated. In the rodent somatosensory cortex, two major classes of L6 CThNs have been identified: one projecting to the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM‐only L6 CThNs) and one projecting to both VPM and the posterior medial nucleus (VPM/POm L6 CThNs). Using rabies‐based tracing methods in mice, we asked whether these L6 CThN populations integrate similar synaptic inputs. We found that both types of L6 CThNs received local input from somatosensory cortex and thalamic input from VPM and POm. However, VPM/POm L6 CThNs received significantly more input from a number of additional cortical areas, higher order thalamic nuclei, and subcortical structures. We also found that the two types of L6 CThNs target different functional regions within the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Together, our results indicate that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in the somatosensory cortex and suggest that VPM‐only L6 CThNs regulate, via their more restricted circuits, sensory responses related to a cortical column while VPM/POm L6 CThNs, which are integrated into more widespread POm‐related circuits, relay contextual information.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing systems uses non-volatile memory (NVM) to implement
high-density and low-energy synaptic storage. Elevated voltages and currents
needed to operate NVMs cause aging of CMOS-based transistors in each neuron and
synapse circuit in the hardware, drifting the transistor's parameters from
their nominal values. Aggressive device scaling increases power density and
temperature, which accelerates the aging, challenging the reliable operation of
neuromorphic systems. Existing reliability-oriented techniques periodically
de-stress all neuron and synapse circuits in the hardware at fixed intervals,
assuming worst-case operating conditions, without actually tracking their aging
at run time. To de-stress these circuits, normal operation must be interrupted,
which introduces latency in spike generation and propagation, impacting the
inter-spike interval and hence, performance, e.g., accuracy. We propose a new
architectural technique to mitigate the aging-related reliability problems in
neuromorphic systems, by designing an intelligent run-time manager (NCRTM),
which dynamically destresses neuron and synapse circuits in response to the
short-term aging in their CMOS transistors during the execution of machine
learning workloads, with the objective of meeting a reliability target. NCRTM
de-stresses these circuits only when it is absolutely necessary to do so,
otherwise reducing the performance impact by scheduling de-stress operations
off the critical path. We evaluate NCRTM with state-of-the-art machine learning
workloads on a neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate that NCRTM
significantly improves the reliability of neuromorphic hardware, with marginal
impact on performance.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: NeuroXplorer 1.0: An Extensible Framework for Architectural Exploration with Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2105.01795v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01795</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01795</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, both industry and academia have proposed many different
neuromorphic architectures to execute applications that are designed with
Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Consequently, there is a growing need for an
extensible simulation framework that can perform architectural explorations
with SNNs, including both platform-based design of today's hardware, and
hardware-software co-design and design-technology co-optimization of the
future. We present NeuroXplorer, a fast and extensible framework that is based
on a generalized template for modeling a neuromorphic architecture that can be
infused with the specific details of a given hardware and/or technology.
NeuroXplorer can perform both low-level cycle-accurate architectural
simulations and high-level analysis with data-flow abstractions. NeuroXplorer's
optimization engine can incorporate hardware-oriented metrics such as energy,
throughput, and latency, as well as SNN-oriented metrics such as inter-spike
interval distortion and spike disorder, which directly impact SNN performance.
We demonstrate the architectural exploration capabilities of NeuroXplorer
through case studies with many state-of-the-art machine learning models.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: BEAN: Interpretable Representation Learning with Biologically-Enhanced Artificial Neuronal Assembly Regularization. (arXiv:1909.13698v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13698</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known for extracting useful information from
large amounts of data. However, the representations learned in DNNs are
typically hard to interpret, especially in dense layers. One crucial issue of
the classical DNN model such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) is that neurons in
the same layer of DNNs are conditionally independent of each other, which makes
co-training and emergence of higher modularity difficult. In contrast to DNNs,
biological neurons in mammalian brains display substantial dependency patterns.
Specifically, biological neural networks encode representations by so-called
neuronal assemblies: groups of neurons interconnected by strong synaptic
interactions and sharing joint semantic content. The resulting population
coding is essential for human cognitive and mnemonic processes. Here, we
propose a novel Biologically Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN)
regularization to model neuronal correlations and dependencies, inspired by
cell assembly theory from neuroscience. Experimental results show that BEAN
enables the formation of interpretable neuronal functional clusters and
consequently promotes a sparse, memory/computation-efficient network without
loss of model performance. Moreover, our few-shot learning experiments
demonstrate that BEAN could also enhance the generalizability of the model when
training samples are extremely limited.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Diagnostic Yield of Whole Exome Sequencing for Adults with Ataxia: a Brazilian Perspective</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01268-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies using whole exome sequencing (WES) have shown that a significant proportion of adult patients with undiagnosed ataxia in European and North American cohorts have a known genetic cause. Little is known about the diagnostic yield of WES in non-Caucasian ataxic populations. Herein, we used WES to investigate a Brazilian cohort of 76 adult patients with idiopathic ataxia previously screened for trinucleotide expansions in known ataxia genes. We collected clinical and radiological data from each patient. WES was performed following standard procedures. Only variants labeled as pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to American college of medical genetics and genomics (ACMG) criteria were retrieved. We determined the diagnostic yield of WES for the whole cohort and also for subgroups defined according to presence or not of pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar atrophy. There were 41 women and 35 men. Mean age at testing was 48 years. Pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, tremor, and cerebellar atrophy were found in 38.1%, 13.1%, 10.5%, and 68.3% of all subjects, respectively. Diagnostic yield of WES was 35.5%. Thirty-six distinct mutations were found in 20 different genes, determining the diagnosis of 18 autosomal recessive and 9 autosomal dominant ataxias. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SACS &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; SPG7&lt;/em&gt; were the most frequently found underlying genes. WES performed better in the subgroup with vs the subgroup without spasticity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005). WES was diagnostic in 35.5% of cases of the Brazilian cohort of ataxia cases. These results have implications for diagnosis, genetic counseling and eventually treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to investigate the enhancement characteristics of vessel wall in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) using 3D high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and their relationship with initial and recurrent intracranial hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Consecutive patients with MMD were retrospectively analyzed and classified as intracranial hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic groups according to the CT or MR images. The clinical features and vessel wall characteristics were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression was performed to relate the vessel wall characteristics to the initial hemorrhage in MMD patients. Patients in hemorrhagic group were followed up after surgery to evaluate the relationship between vessel wall characteristics and recurrent hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A total of 507 MMD patients including 79 hemorrhagic and 428 non-hemorrhagic MMD patients were recruited in the study. We found that hemorrhagic group had more patients with vessel wall enhancements (40.5% vs. 25.7%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) and more eccentric enhanced lesions (17.7% vs. 6.5%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) compared to those in non-hemorrhage group and vessel wall enhancements were independently associated with ipsilateral initial hemorrhage after adjusted for clinical factors (OR = 1.99, CI 1.20–3.28, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007). Furthermore, three recurrent intracranial hemorrhagic episodes in the present study were all observed in MMD patients with vessel wall enhancement during the long-term follow-up after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Wall enhancement of intracranial vessels was significantly associated with intracranial hemorrhage in MMD patients. Our findings suggest that vessel wall enhancement may serve as a marker of intracranial hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Many species use eye movements to direct their overt attention toward specific targets within their environments. Some species can move each eye independently but we have a limited understanding of whether they can simultaneously monitor different targets with each eye. This study, therefore, tested whether a songbird can independently move its eyes towards two different targets. Captive great-tailed grackles (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Quiscalus mexicanus&lt;/em&gt;) were simultaneously presented with one target in their left visual field and another target in their right visual field; the targets were both in the upper visual fields, both in the lower visual fields, or one target was in the upper visual field of one eye, while the other target was in the lower visual field of the other eye. The grackles correctly directed their left and right eyes toward the targets regardless of where the targets appeared at levels greater than chance. These results demonstrate that an avian species can perform simultaneous eye movements towards two different targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Effects of gait rehabilitation on motor coordination in stroke survivors: an UCM-based approach</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Post-stroke locomotion is usually characterized by asymmetrical gait patterns, compensatory movements of trunk and nonparetic limb, altered motor coordination, and wide inter-stride variability. This pilot study was designed to test a twofold hypothesis: post-stroke survivors can exploit the redundancy of the segmental angles to stabilize the 3D footpath trajectory during the swing phase, in accordance with the Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) theory; an intense rehabilitative treatment improves both motor performance and outcomes of the UCM analysis. Ten stroke survivors underwent two evaluation sessions, before and after a conventional multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation program, encompassing clinical tests and gait analysis, both overground and on treadmill. In addition, the UCM analysis was implemented to investigate whether variance of segmental angles is structured to minimize the inter-stride variability of the 3D footpath during the swing phase of treadmill locomotion. Both clinical and spatio-temporal parameters improved after the treatment, even if the statistical significance was reached for a limited set of them. The UCM analysis suggested that post-stroke survivors exploit the redundancy of lower limbs segmental angles mainly during the late swing, without significant differences between affected and unaffected sides. Thereafter, the main significant effects of the rehabilitative treatment consisted in strengthening the synergistic organization of the redundant segmental angles involving a more accurate control of the 3D footpath. Concluding, the UCM theory can be a promising tool to appraise the effects of a specific rehabilitative protocol on motor coordination in post-stroke survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cancer and cancer pain processes a major clinical challenge and the underlined mechanisms of pathogenesis remain elusive. We examined the specific changes in the transcriptomic profiles in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of rats with bone cancer and bone cancer pain (BCP) using RNA sequencing technology. The bone cancer and BCP was induced by tumor cells implantation (TCI) into the tibia bone cavity in adult female rats. One week after treatment, TCI caused up- and down-regulation of thousands of genes in DRG. These genes were mainly involved in the immune process, inflammatory response, and intracellular signaling transduction of carbohydrate and cytokine. The cAMP and calcium signaling pathways were the major processes in the initial responses. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis further showed that the genes for ion channels increased during day 1-7, while the genes for cytokine signaling pathways sustainedly increased during day 7-14 after TCI. The time courses of gene expression for ion channels and cytokines support their distinct roles in the early induction and late maintenance of BCP development. In addition, among the top 500 up- and down-regulated genes, 80-90% were unique for bone cancer pain as well as neuropathic and inflammatory pain, while less than 2% were shared among the three different forms of pain. This study reveals the uniqueness of mechanisms underlying bone cancer with pain, which is, to a large extent, differently from pain after acute inflammatory and nerve injury and provides novel potential targets of DEGs for bone cancer with pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is the central nervous system that governs human activities. However, in modern society, more and more diseases threaten the health of the brain and nerves and spinal cord, making the human brain unable to conduct normal information interaction with the outside world. The rehabilitation training of the brain-computer interface can promote the nerve repair of the sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain diseases. Therefore, the research of brain-computer interface for motor imaging is of great significance for patients with brain diseases to restore motor function. Due to the characteristics of non-stationary, nonlinear, and individual differences of EEG signals, there are still many difficulties in the analysis and classification of EEG signals at this stage. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model was used to classify motor-imaging EEG signals, identify the user’s intention, and control external devices. Considering that single-modal features cannot represent the core information, this study uses a fusion feature that combines temporal and spatial features as the final feature data. The fusion features are input to the trained ELM classifier, and the final classification result is obtained. Two sets of BCI competition data in the BCI competition public database are used to verify the validity of the model. The experimental results show that the ELM model has achieved a classification accuracy of 0.7832 in the classification task of Data Sets IIb, which is higher than other comparison algorithms, and shows universal applicability among different subjects. In addition, the average recognition rate of this model in the Data Sets IIIa classification task reaches 0.8347, which has obvious advantages compared with the comparative classification algorithm. The classification effect is smaller than the classification effect obtained by the champion algorithm of the same project, which has certain reference value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia and Future Therapeutic Directions: Beneficial Effects of Small Compounds Acting on Cellular Stress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited neurodegenerative conditions that share a characteristic feature of degeneration of the longest axons within the corticospinal tract, which leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Mutations of over 70 genes produce defects in various biological pathways: axonal transport, lipid metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shaping, mitochondrial function, and endosomal trafficking. HSPs suffer from an adequate therapeutic plan. Currently the treatments foreseen for patients affected by this pathology are physiotherapy, to maintain the outgoing tone, and muscle relaxant therapies for spasticity. Very few clinical studies have been conducted, and it’s urgent to implement preclinical animal studies devoted to pharmacological test and screening, to expand the rose of compounds potentially attractive for clinical trials. Small animal models, such as Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish, have been generated, analyzed, and used as preclinical model for screening of compounds and their effects. In this work, we briefly described the role of HSP-linked proteins in the organization of ER endomembrane system and in the regulation of ER homeostasis and stress as a common pathological mechanism for these HSP forms. We then focused our attention on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features of some recently identified molecules with antioxidant property, such as salubrinal, guanabenz, N-acetyl cysteine, methylene blue, rapamycin, and naringenin, and on their potential use in future clinical studies. Expanding the models and the pharmacological screening for HSP disease is necessary to give an opportunity to patients and clinicians to test new molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Stable Meta-Networks, Noise, and Artifacts in the Human Connectome: Low- to High-Dimensional Independent Components Analysis as a Hierarchy of Intrinsic Connectivity Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.625737</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Connectivity within the human connectome occurs between multiple neuronal systems—at small to very large spatial scales. Independent component analysis (ICA) is potentially a powerful tool to facilitate multi-scale analyses. However, ICA has yet to be fully evaluated at very low (10 or fewer) and ultra-high dimensionalities (200 or greater). The current investigation used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to determine the following: (1) if larger networks, or meta-networks, are present at low dimensionality, (2) if nuisance sources increase with dimensionality, and (3) if ICA is prone to overfitting. Using bootstrap ICA, results suggested that, at very low dimensionality, ICA spatial maps consisted of Visual/Attention and Default/Control meta-networks. At fewer than 10 components, well-known networks such as the Somatomotor Network were absent from results. At high dimensionality, nuisance sources were present even in denoised high-quality data but were identifiable by correlation with tissue probability maps. Artifactual overfitting occurred to a minor degree at high dimensionalities. Basic summary statistics on spatial maps (maximum cluster size, maximum component weight, and average weight outside of maximum cluster) quickly and easily separated artifacts from gray matter sources. Lastly, by using weighted averages of bootstrap stability, even ultra-high dimensional ICA resulted in highly reproducible spatial maps. These results demonstrate how ICA can be applied in multi-scale analyses, reliably and accurately reproducing the hierarchy of meta-networks, large-scale networks, and subnetworks, thereby characterizing cortical connectivity across multiple spatial scales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Voxel-Based State Space Modeling Recovers Task-Related Cognitive States in Naturalistic fMRI Experiments</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex natural tasks likely recruit many different functional brain networks, but it is difficult to predict how such tasks will be represented across cortical areas and networks. Previous electrophysiology studies suggest that task variables are represented in a low-dimensional subspace within the activity space of neural populations. Here we develop a voxel-based state space modeling method for recovering task-related state spaces from human fMRI data. We apply this method to data acquired in a controlled visual attention task and a video game task. We find that each task induces distinct brain states that can be embedded in a low-dimensional state space that reflects task parameters, and that attention increases state separation in the task-related subspace. Our results demonstrate that the state space framework offers a powerful approach for modeling human brain activity elicited by complex natural tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Polynomial, piecewise-Linear, Step (PLS): A Simple, Scalable, and Efficient Framework for Modeling Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biological neurons can be modeled with different levels of biophysical/biochemical details. The accuracy with which a model reflects the actual physiological processes and ultimately the information function of a neuron, can range from very detailed to a schematic phenomenological representation. This range exists due to the common problem: one needs to find an optimal trade-off between the level of details needed to capture the necessary information processing in a neuron and the computational load needed to compute 1 s of model time. An increase in modeled network size or model-time, for which the solution should be obtained, makes this trade-off pivotal in model development. Numerical simulations become incredibly challenging when an extensive network with a detailed representation of each neuron needs to be modeled over a long time interval to study slow evolving processes, e.g., development of the thalamocortical circuits. Here we suggest a simple, powerful and flexible approach in which we approximate the right-hand sides of differential equations by combinations of functions from three families: Polynomial, piecewise-Linear, Step (PLS). To obtain a single coherent framework, we provide four core principles in which PLS functions should be combined. We show the rationale behind each of the core principles. Two examples illustrate how to build a conductance-based or phenomenological model using the PLS-framework. We use the first example as a benchmark on three different computational platforms: CPU, GPU, and mobile system-on-chip devices. We show that the PLS-framework speeds up computations without increasing the memory footprint and maintains high model fidelity comparable to the fully-computed model or with lookup-table approximation. We are convinced that the full range of neuron models: from biophysical to phenomenological and even to abstract models, may benefit from using the PLS-framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Phase-Dependent Crossed Inhibition Mediating Coordination of Anti-phase Bilateral Rhythmic Movement: A Mini Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The activity of the left and right central pattern generators (CPGs) is efficiently coordinated during locomotion. To achieve this coordination, the interplay between the CPG controlling one leg and that controlling another must be present. Previous findings in aquatic vertebrates and mammalians suggest that the alternate activation of the left and right CPGs is mediated by the commissural interneurons crossing the midline of the spinal cord. Especially, V0 commissural interneurons mediate crossed inhibition during the alternative activity of the left and right CPGs. Even in humans, phase-dependent modulation of the crossed afferent inhibition during gait has been reported. Based on those previous findings, crossed inhibition of the CPG in one leg side caused by the activation of the contralateral CPG is a possible mechanism underlying the coordination of the anti-phase rhythmic movement of the legs. It has been hypothesized that the activity of the flexor half center in the CPG inhibits the contralateral flexor half center, but crossed inhibition of the extensor half center is not present because of the existence of the double limb support during gait. Nevertheless, previous findings on the phase-dependent crossed inhibition during anti-phase bilateral movement of the legs are not in line with this hypothesis. For example, extensor activity caused crossed inhibition of the flexor half center during bilateral cycling of the legs. In another study, the ankle extensor was inhibited at the period switching from extension to flexion during anti-phase rhythmic movement of the ankles. In this review article, I provide a critical discussion about crossed inhibition mediating the coordination of the anti-phase bilateral rhythmic movement of the legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Biomarkers Distinguish Severe From Mild Autism Spectrum Disorder Among High-Functioning Individuals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have reported atypicality in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the relatively small effect sizes prevent us from using these characteristics for diagnostic purposes. Here, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to partition the high-functioning ASD group (i.e., the ASD discovery group) into subgroups. A support vector machine (SVM) model was trained through the 10-fold strategy to predict Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores within the ASD discovery group (r = 0.30, P &amp;lt; 0.001, n = 260), which was further validated in an independent sample (i.e., the ASD validation group) (r = 0.35, P = 0.031, n = 29). The neuroimage-based partition derived two subgroups representing severe versus mild autistic patients. We identified FCs that show graded changes in strength from ASD-severe, through ASD-mild, to controls, while the same pattern cannot be observed in partitions based on ADOS score. We also identified FCs that are specific for ASD-mild, similar to a partition based on ADOS score. The current study provided multiple pieces of evidence with replication to show that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) FCs could serve as neural biomarkers in partitioning high-functioning autistic individuals based on their symptom severity and showing advantages over traditional partition based on ADOS score. Our results also indicate a compensatory role for a frontocortical network in patients with mild ASD, indicating potential targets for future clinical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Principal Components Analysis Using Data Collected From Healthy Individuals on Two Robotic Assessment Platforms Yields Similar Behavioral Patterns</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Kinarm Standard Tests (KSTs) is a suite of upper limb tasks to assess sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, which produces granular performance data that reflect spatial and temporal aspects of behavior (&amp;gt;100 variables per individual). We have previously used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data using the Kinarm End-Point Lab (EP). Here, we performed PCA using data from the Kinarm Exoskeleton Lab (EXO), and determined agreement of PCA results across EP and EXO platforms in healthy participants. We additionally examined whether further dimensionality reduction was possible by using PCA across behavioral tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy participants were assessed using the Kinarm EXO (N = 469) and EP (N = 170–200). Four behavioral tasks (six assessments in total) were performed that quantified arm sensory and motor function, including position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)] and three motor tasks [Visually Guided Reaching (VGR), Object Hit (OH), and Object Hit and Avoid (OHA)]. The number of components to include per task was determined from scree plots and parallel analysis, and rotation type (orthogonal vs. oblique) was decided on a per-task basis. To assess agreement, we compared principal components (PCs) across platforms using distance correlation. We additionally considered inter-task interactions in EXO data by performing PCA across all six behavioral assessments.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;By applying PCA on a per task basis to data collected using the EXO, the number of behavioral parameters were substantially reduced by 58–75% while accounting for 76–87% of the variance. These results compared well to the EP analysis, and we found good-to-excellent agreement values (0.75–0.99) between PCs from the EXO and those from the EP. Finally, we were able to reduce the dimensionality of the EXO data across tasks down to 16 components out of a total of 76 behavioral parameters, which represents a reduction of 79% while accounting for 73% of the total variance.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;PCA of Kinarm robotic assessment appears to capture similar relationships between kinematic features in healthy individuals and is agnostic to the robotic platform used for collection. Further work is needed to investigate the use of PCA-based data reduction for the characterization of neurological deficits in clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Validated self-report measures of post-stroke fatigue are lacking. The Dutch Multifactor Fatigue Scale (DMFS) was translated into Danish, and response process evidence of validity was evaluated. DMFS consists of 38 Likert-rated items distributed on five subscales: Impact of fatigue (11 items), Signs and direct consequences of fatigue (9), Mental fatigue (7), Physical fatigue (6), and Coping with fatigue (5). Response processes to DMFS were investigated using a Three-Step Test-Interview (TSTI) protocol, and data were analyzed using Framework Analysis. Response processes were indexed on the following categories: (i) “congruent,” response processes were related to the subscale construct; (ii) “incongruent,” response processes were not related to the subscale construct; (iii) “ambiguous,” response processes were both congruent and incongruent or insufficient to evaluate congruency; and (iv) “confused,” participants did not understand the item. Nine adults were recruited consecutively 10–34 months post-stroke (median = 26.5) at an outpatient brain injury rehabilitation center in 2019 [five females, mean age = 55 years (SD = 6.3)]. Problematic items were defined as &amp;lt;50% of response processes being congruent with the intended construct. Of the 38 items, five problematic items were identified, including four items of Physical fatigue and one of Mental fatigue. In addition, seven items posed various response difficulties to some participants due to syntactic complexity, vague terms, a presupposition, and a double-barrelled statement. In conclusion, findings elucidate the interpretative processes involved in responding to DMFS post-stroke, strengthen the evidence base of validity, and guide revisions to mitigate potential problems in item performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Use of Quantitative Sensation Testing to Identify the Physiological Differences Between the Median and Ulnar Nerves</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Similarities in morphology, physiological function, and neurophysiological findings between median and ulnar nerves are not unequivocal. Our previous study confirmed differences in motor fiber parameters between these nerves in healthy persons. We made an attempt to assess and compare the physiological parameters of different sensation modalities (temperature, pain, and vibration) in median and ulnar nerves.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study was performed in 31 healthy, right-handed volunteers: 17 women, 14 men, mean age 44.8 ± 15.5 years. Standard sensory conduction tests in the median and ulnar nerves were performed together with the estimation of vibratory, temperature, and warm- and cold-induced pain thresholds in the C7 and C8 dermatomes on the palm, using quantitative sensory testing.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were no statistically significant differences in the standard sensory conduction test in the median and ulnar nerves across the whole group: between right and left hands, and between women and men. We revealed differences in the temperature and pain thresholds between these nerves, mainly in low temperature perception. There were no differences in estimated thresholds between sides or in female and male groups. The vibratory limits did not differ significantly between nerves, and subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The study confirmed the differences in the physiological sensory perception between the median and ulnar nerves. The median nerve is more sensitive to temperature stimulation than the ulnar nerve, but simultaneously less sensitive to pain-inducing temperature stimuli. These findings should be considered during the examination of hand nerve pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: EAAT5 Glutamate Transporter-Mediated Inhibition in the Vertebrate Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662859</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporters typically remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In addition, all glutamate transporters have a chloride channel, which is opened upon glutamate binding to the transporter. There are five types of glutamate transporter (EAATs 1–5, excitatory amino acid transporters), which have distinct chloride conductances. Some EAATs that have low chloride conductances, remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft most effectively (e.g., EAAT1). By contrast, EAATs that have high chloride conductances, remove glutamate less effectively (e.g., EAAT5). We have studied EAAT5 in the retina. In the retina, light activates a chloride current, mediated by the glutamate activation of EAAT5. EAAT5 is not a significant contributor to lateral inhibition in the retina. Instead, it is the main source of autoinhibition to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). EAAT5-mediated inhibition has a substantial effect on synaptic transmission from RBCs to downstream retinal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rod and Cone Connections With Bipolar Cells in the Rabbit Retina</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rod and cone pathways are segregated in the first stage of the retina: cones synapse with both ON- and OFF-cone bipolar cells while rods contact only rod bipolar cells. However, there is an exception to this specific wiring in that rods also contact certain OFF cone bipolar cells, providing a tertiary rod pathway. Recently, it has been proposed that there is even more crossover between rod and cone pathways. Physiological recordings suggested that rod bipolar cells receive input from cones, and ON cone bipolar cells can receive input from rods, in addition to the established pathways. To image their rod and cone contacts, we have dye-filled individual rod bipolar cells in the rabbit retina. We report that approximately half the rod bipolar cells receive one or two cone contacts. Dye-filling AII amacrine cells, combined with subtractive labeling, revealed most of the ON cone bipolar cells to which they were coupled, including the occasional blue cone bipolar cell, identified by its contacts with blue cones. Imaging the AII-coupled ON cone bipolar dendrites in this way showed that they contact cones exclusively. We conclude that there is some limited cone input to rod bipolar cells, but we could find no evidence for rod contacts with ON cone bipolar cells. The tertiary rod OFF pathway operates via direct contacts between rods and OFF cone bipolar cells. In contrast, our results do not support the presence of a tertiary rod ON pathway in the rabbit retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Beta-Secretase 1 Underlies Reactive Astrocytes and Endothelial Disruption in Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in the neurovascular unit (NVU) is a key component in the progressive deterioration of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is critical in vascular dementia. Recent studies have shown that inflammation plays early and perhaps causal roles in the pathogenesis of AD related to NVU damage, possibly in part by overactivating the aspartic acid protease activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which until now has almost solely been studied in the context of the β-amyloid cascade. In this study, we analyzed the relationship of BACE1 with astrocytes and blood vessels in human brains with sporadic and familial dementia [Autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD), and familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)] and how BACE1 inhibition affects astrocytes and endothelial cells under conditions of glutamate toxicity. Our results show increased BACE1, PHF (Paired helical filaments)-tau and GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein) immunoreactivity (IR) in the CA1 hippocampal regions of FAD and SAD brains. Furthermore, BACE1 immunoprecipitated with GFAP in tissue samples from all study cases, but their immunofluorescence close to (10 μm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or overlapping blood vessels was only increased in FAD and SAD brains, and PHF-tau was present around the vessels mainly in FAD brains. Interestingly, the increased BACE1 levels were associated with reactive astrocytes, characterized by morphological changes and upregulation of GFAP under pathological and stressful conditions, and endothelial disruption by glutamate excitotoxicity, and these effects were reversed by BACE1 inhibition; further, BACE1-inhibited astrocytes protected endothelial cell integrity by preserving zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) distribution and decreasing the expression of inflammatory markers. Taken together, these findings suggest that BACE1 dysregulation in astrocytes may have a role in the alterations in NVU integrity implicated in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive Function Changes in Older People. Results of Second Wave of Cognition of Older People, Education, Recreational Activities, NutritIon, Comorbidities, fUnctional Capacity Studies (COPERNICUS)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653570</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve explains why subjects with more years of education, professional achievement, or participation in recreational activities show less cognitive decline with aging. We hypothesize that levels of recreational travel, education, occupation, systemic health, physical performance, and current cognitive activity levels affect the trajectory of cognitive function in older, healthy people in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy, older people (N = 205) were examined and followed-up at 2 years. Participants completed physical and cognitive function assessments: including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its two subtests Delayed Recall (DR) and Verbal Fluency (VF), and Trail Making Test Part B (TMT B). Factors associated with cognitive functioning were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The MMSE result significantly decreased over 2 years. No significant decrease in other cognitive tests was noted. However, the trajectory of cognitive tests results varied between individual participants. Percentage of variance of change was explained by the following predictors: 21 in MMSE, 24 in MoCA, 8 in DR, 25 in VF, and 24 in TMT B. Age and the presence of varicose veins were significantly linked to negative changes in MMSE and MoCA scores, while working in a professional occupational status associated with a higher score. The subgroup with varicose veins did worse on the Delayed Recall subtest of MoCA.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve could be extended by proxies of reserve that are related to systemic health and travel activity. The latter is a combination of social, physical, and cognitive activity and potentially might serve as an intervention to improve cognitive function in older people. However, due to the limitations of this study, results should be interpreted with caution and needs to be replicated in the further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Machine Learning for the Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Literature</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.633752</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly based on medical observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and associated outcomes. These studies demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical decision making, leading to increasingly systematic, informed diagnosis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dietary Habits and Nutrient Intakes Are Associated to Age-Related Central Auditory Processing Disorder in a Cohort From Southern Italy</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) commonly occurs in older age. However, few studies of a possible link between age-related CAPD and diet in an older population have been conducted. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between eating habits and age-related CAPD in a population &amp;gt;65 years, using cross-sectional and retrospective data obtained in the same population-based study about 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We selected 734 participants (403 men) from a large population-based study. For age-related CAPD assessment, we used the Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competitive Message test. Dietary habits were assessed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Associations between age-related CAPD and food groups/macro-and micronutrients were explored using adjusted logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Age-related CAPD subjects consumed more dairy (111 vs. 98 g/d), olives and vegetable oil (63 vs. 52 g/d) and spirits (2 vs.1 g/d), and less fruits (536 vs. 651 g/d) in the cross-sectional analysis. Age-related CAPD subjects had a lower intake of potassium, vitamin C, and a higher fat intake. Further analyses identified dietary fiber as being inversely related to age-related CAPD.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The present study provided evidence that the dietary hypotheses proposed for explaining the development of cognitive disorders in older age might also hold for age-related CAPD. Further data from other large and prospective population-based studies are needed for confirming these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Long-Term Administration of Triterpenoids From Ganoderma lucidum Mitigates Age-Associated Brain Physiological Decline via Regulating Sphingolipid Metabolism and Enhancing Autophagy in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the aging society, how to grow old healthily has become an important issue for the whole of society. Effective intervention strategies for healthy aging are most desired, due to the complexity and diversity of genetic information, it is a pressing concern to find a single drug or treatment to improve longevity. In this study, long-term administration of triterpenoids of Ganoderma lucidum (TGL) can mitigate brain physiological decline in normal aging mice. In addition, the age-associated pathological features, including cataract formation, hair loss, and skin relaxation, brown adipose tissue accumulation, the β-galactosidase staining degree of kidney, the iron death of spleen, and liver functions exhibit improvement. We used the APP/PS1 mice and 3 × Tg-AD mice model of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) to further verify the improvement of brain function by TGL and found that Ganoderic acid A might be the effective constituent of TGL for anti-aging of the brain in the 3 × Tg-AD mice. A potential mechanism of action may involve the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, prolonging of telomere length, and enhance autophagy, which allows for the removal of pathological metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: PET Neuroimaging of Alzheimer's Disease: Radiotracers and Their Utility in Clinical Research</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.624330</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of senile dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and exerting tremendous socioeconomic burden on all societies. Although definitive diagnosis of AD is often made in the presence of clinical manifestations in late stages, it is now universally believed that AD is a continuum of disease commencing from the preclinical stage with typical neuropathological alterations appearing decades prior to its first symptom, to the prodromal stage with slight symptoms of amnesia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI), and then to the terminal stage with extensive loss of basic cognitive functions, i.e., AD-dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have been developed in a search to meet the increasing clinical need of early detection and treatment monitoring for AD, with reference to the pathophysiological targets in Alzheimer's brain. These include the pathological aggregations of misfolded proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plagues and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), impaired neurotransmitter system, neuroinflammation, as well as deficient synaptic vesicles and glucose utilization. In this article we survey the various PET radiotracers available for AD imaging and discuss their clinical applications especially in terms of early detection and cognitive relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of White Matter Hyperintensities on Verbal Fluency in Healthy Older Adults and MCI/AD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.614809</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.614809</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are markers for cerebrovascular pathology, which are frequently seen in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Verbal fluency is often impaired especially in AD, but little research has been conducted concerning the specific effects of WMH on verbal fluency in MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;Our aim was to examine the relationship between WMH and verbal fluency in healthy old age and pathological aging (MCI/AD) using quantified MRI data.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Measures for semantic and phonemic fluency as well as quantified MRI imaging data from a sample of 42 cognitively healthy older adults and 44 patients with MCI/AD (total n = 86) were utilized. Analyses were performed both using the total sample that contained seven left-handed/ambidextrous participants, as well with a sample containing only right-handed participants (n = 79) in order to guard against possible confounding effects regarding language lateralization.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After controlling for age and education and adjusting for multiple correction, WMH in the bilateral frontal and parieto-occipital areas as well as the right temporal area were associated with semantic fluency in cognitively healthy and MCI/AD patients but only in the models containing solely right-handed participants.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that white matter pathology in both frontal and parieto-occipital cerebral areas may have associations with impaired semantic fluency in right-handed older adults. However, elevated levels of WMH do not seem to be associated with cumulative effects on verbal fluency impairment in patients with MCI or AD. Further studies on the subject are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Endogenous p53 expression in human and mouse is not regulated by its 3′UTR</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65700</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65700</link>
	<description>The &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes the tumor suppressor p53 which is functionally inactivated in many human cancers. Numerous studies suggested that 3′UTR-mediated p53 expression regulation plays a role in tumorigenesis and could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. However, these studies did not investigate post-transcriptional regulation of the native &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; gene. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the human and mouse &lt;i&gt;TP53/Trp53&lt;/i&gt; 3′UTRs while preserving endogenous mRNA processing. This revealed that the endogenous 3′UTR is not involved in regulating p53 mRNA or protein expression neither in steady state nor after genotoxic stress. Using reporter assays, we confirmed the previously observed repressive effects of the isolated 3′UTR. However, addition of the &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; coding region to the reporter had a dominant negative impact on expression as its repressive effect was stronger and abrogated the contribution of the 3′UTR. Our data highlight the importance of genetic models in the validation of post-transcriptional gene regulatory effects.</description>

	<description>Animals must balance needs to approach threats for risk-assessment and to avoid danger. The dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) controls defensive behaviors, but it is unknown how it represents states associated with threat approach and avoidance. We identified a dPAG threat-avoidance ensemble in mice that showed higher activity far from threats such as the open arms of the elevated plus maze and a live predator. These cells were also more active during threat-avoidance behaviors such as escape and freezing, even though these behaviors have antagonistic motor output. Conversely, the threat-approach ensemble was more active during risk-assessment behaviors and near threats. Furthermore, unsupervised methods showed that avoidance/approach states were encoded with shared activity patterns across threats. Lastly, the relative number of cells in each ensemble predicted threat-avoidance across mice. Thus, dPAG ensembles dynamically encode threat approach and avoidance states, providing a flexible mechanism to balance risk-assessment and danger avoidance.</description>

	<title>eLife: Instantaneous movement-unrelated midbrain activity modifies ongoing eye movements</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64150</link>
	<description>At any moment in time, new information is sampled from the environment and interacts with ongoing brain state. Often, such interaction takes place within individual circuits that are capable of both mediating the internally ongoing plan as well as representing exogenous sensory events. Here we investigated how sensory-driven neural activity can be integrated, very often in the same neuron types, into ongoing saccade motor commands. Despite the ballistic nature of saccades, visually-induced action potentials in the rhesus macaque superior colliculus (SC), a structure known to drive eye movements, not only occurred intra-saccadically, but they were also associated with highly predictable modifications of ongoing eye movements. Such predictable modifications reflected a simultaneity of movement-related discharge at one SC site and visually-induced activity at another. Our results suggest instantaneous readout of the SC during movement generation, irrespective of activity source, and they explain a significant component of kinematic variability of motor outputs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Non-canonical Hedgehog signaling regulates spinal cord and muscle regeneration in Xenopus laevis larvae</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61804</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61804</link>
	<description>Inducing regeneration in injured spinal cord represents one of modern medicine's greatest challenges. Research from a variety of model organisms indicates that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling may be a useful target to drive regeneration. However, the mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling-mediated tissue regeneration remain unclear. Here we examined Hh signaling during post-amputation tail regeneration in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; larvae. We found that while Smoothened (Smo) activity is essential for proper spinal cord and skeletal muscle regeneration, transcriptional activity of the canonical Hh effector Gli is repressed immediately following amputation, and inhibition of Gli1/2 expression or transcriptional activity has minimal effects on regeneration. In contrast, we demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA) is necessary for regeneration of both muscle and spinal cord, in concert with and independent of Smo respectively, and that its downstream effector CREB is activated in spinal cord following amputation in a Smo-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that non-canonical mechanisms of Hh signaling are necessary for spinal cord and muscle regeneration.</description>

	<description>Pathogens encounter numerous antimicrobial responses during infection, including the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. ROS-mediated oxidation of host membrane poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) generates the toxic alpha-beta carbonyl 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Though studied extensively in the context of sterile inflammation, research into 4-HNE's role during infection remains limited. Here we found that 4-HNE is generated during bacterial infection, that it impacts growth and survival in a range of bacteria, and that the intracellular pathogen &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; induces many genes in response to 4-HNE exposure. A component of the&lt;i&gt; L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; 4-HNE response is the expression of the genes &lt;i&gt;lmo0103&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;lmo0613, &lt;/i&gt;deemed &lt;i&gt;rha1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;rha2 &lt;/i&gt;(reductase of host alkenals), respectively, which code for two NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases that convert 4-HNE to the product 4-hydroxynonanal (4-HNA). Loss of these genes had no impact on &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; bacterial burdens during murine or tissue culture infection. However, heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;rha1/2&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; significantly increased bacterial resistance to 4-HNE &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;and promoted bacterial survival following phagocytosis by murine macrophages in an ROS dependent manner. Thus, Rha1 and Rha2 are not necessary for 4-HNE resistance in &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; but are sufficient to confer resistance to an otherwise sensitive organism &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in host cells. Our work demonstrates that 4-HNE is a previously unappreciated component of ROS-mediated toxicity encountered by bacteria within eukaryotic hosts.</description>

	<description>Dendritic spines act as computational units and must adapt their responses according to their activation history. Calcium influx acts as the first signaling step during postsynaptic activation and is a determinant of synaptic weight change. Dendritic spines also come in a variety of sizes and shapes. To probe the relationship between calcium dynamics and spine morphology, we used a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of calcium dynamics in idealized and realistic geometries. We show that despite the stochastic nature of the various calcium channels, receptors, and pumps, spine size and shape can separately modulate calcium dynamics and subsequently synaptic weight updates in a deterministic manner. The relationships between calcium dynamics and spine morphology identified in idealized geometries also hold in realistic geometries suggesting that there are geometrically determined deterministic relationships that may modulate synaptic weight change.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Decoding the silence: Neural bases of zero pronoun resolution in Chinese</title>

	<description>Chinese is one of many languages that can drop subjects. We report an fMRI study of language comprehension processes in these &quot;zero pronoun&quot; cases. The fMRI data come from Chinese speakers who listened to an audiobook. We conducted both univariate GLM and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on these data time-locked to each verb with a zero pronoun subject. We found increased left middle temporal gyrus activity for zero pronouns compared to overt subjects, suggesting additional effort searching for an antecedent during zero pronoun resolution. MVPA further revealed that the intended referent of a zero pronoun seems to be physically represented in the Precuneus and the Parahippocampal Gyrus shortly after its presentation. This highlights the role of memory and discourse-level processing in resolving referential expressions, including unspoken ones, in naturalistic language comprehension.</description>

	<description>Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is the most severe pathological feature of traumatic brain injury. However, how primary axonal injury is induced by mechanical stress and whether it could be mitigated remain unknown, largely due to the resolution limits of medical imaging approaches. Here we established an Axon-on-a-Chip (AoC) model for mimicking DAI and investigating its early cellular responses. By integrating computational fluid dynamics and microfluidic techniques, DAI was observed for the first time during mechanical stress, and a clear correlation between stress intensity and severity of DAI was elucidated. This AoC was further used to investigate the dynamic intracellular changes occurring simultaneously with stress, and identified delayed local Ca2+ surges escorted rapid disruption of periodic axonal cytoskeleton during the early stage of DAI. Compatible with high-resolution live-microscopy, this model hereby provides a versatile system to identify early mechanisms underlying DAI, offering a platform for screening effective treatments to alleviate brain injuries.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Toward Reliable Network Neuroscience for Mapping Individual Differences</title>

	<description>A rapidly emerging application of network neuroscience in neuroimaging studies has provided useful tools to understand individual differences in complex brain function. However, the variability of methodologies applied across studies - with respect to node definition, edge construction, and graph measurements- makes it difficult to directly compare findings and also challenging for end users to select the optimal strategies for mapping individual differences in brain networks. Here, we aim to provide a benchmark for best practices by systematically comparing the reliability of human brain network measurements of individual differences under different analytical strategies using the test-retest design of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from the Human Connectome Project. The results uncovered four essential principles to guide reliable network neuroscience of individual differences: 1) use a whole brain parcellation to define network nodes, including subcortical and cerebellar regions, 2) construct functional connectome using spontaneous brain activity in multiple slow bands, 3) optimize topological economy of networks at individual level, 4) characterise information flow with metrics of integration and segregation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Changes of the biophysical properties of voltage-gated Na+ currents during maturation of the sodium-taste cells in rat fungiform papillae</title>

	<description>Taste cells are a heterogeneous population of sensory receptors that undergoes a continuous turnover. Different chemo-sensitive cell lines rely on action potentials to release the neurotransmitter onto nerve endings. The electrical excitability is due to the presence of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive, voltage-gated sodium current (INa) similar to that found in neurons. Since the biophysical properties of INa change during neuronal development, we wondered whether the same also occurred in taste cells. Here, we used the patch-clamp recording technique to study INa in sodium sensing cells of rat fungiform papillae. We identified these cells by exploiting the known blocking effect of amiloride on ENaC, the sodium (salt) receptor. Then, based on the amplitude of INa and a morphological analysis, we subdivided sodium cells into two broad developmental groups, namely immature and mature cells. We found that: the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation changed in the transition from immature to mature state (depolarizing shift); the membrane capacitance significantly decreased in mature cells, enhancing the density of INa; a persistent sodium current, absent in immature cells, appeared in mature cells. mRNA expression analysis of the -subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels in fungiform taste buds supported the electrophysiological data. As a whole, our findings provide evidence for a noticeable change in membrane excitability during development, which is consistent with the key role played by electrical signaling in the release of neurotransmitter by mature sodium cells.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cortical granularity shapes information flow to the amygdala and its striatal targets in nonhuman primate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.06.442678v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula, amygdala, and striatum form interconnected networks that drive motivated behaviors. We previously found a connectional trend in which granularity of the ventromedial and orbital PFC/insula predicted connections to the amygdala and also the scope of amygdalo-striatal efferents, including projections beyond the 'classic' ventral striatum. To further interrogate this triad and define the 'limbic (amygdala-recipient) striatum', we conducted tract tracing studies in two cohorts of primates to define the scope of cortico-amygdalo-striatal (indirect) and cortico-'limbic' striatal (direct) paths originating in the entire PFC and insula. With larger data sets and a quantitative approach, we found that the level of cortical granularity predicts the complexity and location of projections to both the amygdala and striatum. Remarkably, 'cortical-like' basal nucleus subdivisions also followed these rules in their projections to the striatum. In both 'direct' and 'indirect' paths to the 'limbic' striatum, agranular cortices formed a 'foundational', broad projection, and were joined by inputs from progressively more differentiated cortices. In amygdalo-striatal paths, the ventral basal nucleus was the 'foundational' input, with progressively more dorsal basal nucleus regions gradually adding inputs as the 'limbic striatum' extended caudally. Together, the 'indirect' and 'direct' paths follow consistent rules dictating projection strength and complexity to their targets. In the 'indirect' path, the agranular 'interoceptive' cortices consistently dominate amygdala inputs to the striatum. In contrast, 'direct' cortical inputs to the 'limbic' (amygdala-recipient) striatum create gradual shifts in connectivity fingerprints to provide clues to functional differences in the classic versus caudal ventral 'limbic' striatum.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Direct comparison of category and spatial selectivity in human occipitotemporal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.06.442603v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Human visual cortex is organised broadly according to two major principles: retinotopy (the spatial mapping of the retina in cortex) and category-selectivity (preferential responses to specific categories of stimuli). Historically, these principles were considered anatomically separate, with retinotopy restricted to the occipital cortex and category-selectivity emerging in lateral-occipital and ventral-temporal cortex. Contrary to this assumption, recent studies show that category-selective regions exhibit systematic retinotopic biases. It is unclear, however, whether responses within these regions are more strongly driven by retinotopic location or by category preference, and if there are systematic differences between category-selective regions in the relative strengths of these preferences. Here, we directly compare spatial and category preferences by measuring fMRI responses to scene and face stimuli presented in the left or right visual field and computing two bias indices: a spatial bias (response to the contralateral minus ipsilateral visual field) and a category bias (response to the preferred minus non-preferred category). We compare these biases within and between scene- and face-selective regions across the lateral and ventral surfaces of visual cortex. We find an interaction between surface and bias: lateral regions show a stronger spatial than category bias, whilst ventral regions show the opposite. These effects are robust across and within subjects, and reflect large-scale, smoothly varying gradients across both surfaces. Together, these findings support distinct functional roles for lateral and ventral category-selective regions in visual information processing in terms of the relative importance of spatial information.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Meta-analytic maps of brain activity evoked by cognitive function diverge from resting state networks</title>

	<description>Spontaneous human brain activity is organized into resting state networks (RSN), complex patterns of synchronized activity that account for the majority of brain metabolism. The correspondence between these patterns and those elicited by task performance suggests that spontaneous brain activity originates from the stream of ongoing cognitive processing. Here we investigate a large number of meta-analytic activation maps obtained from Neurosynth (www.neurosynth.org) to establish that task-rest similarity can be inflated by two potential sources of bias. Applying a hierarchical module detection algorithm to a network representation of activation map similarity, we showed that the correspondence between RSN and task-evoked activity tends to hold only for the largest spatial scales. Second, we established that this correspondence is biased by the inclusion of maps related to neuroanatomical terms (e.g. &quot;parietal&quot;, &quot;occipital&quot;, &quot;cingulate&quot;, etc.). Our results challenge the cognitive origin of spontaneous brain activity, suggesting that anatomically-constrained homeostatic processes could also play an important role in the inception and shaping of human resting state activity fluctuations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice</title>

	<description>The molecular mechanisms of mammalian sleep regulation remain largely unknown. Classical forward and reverse mouse genetic approaches require germline mutations and, thus, are unwieldy to study the sleep functions of essential genes or redundant pathways. It is also costly and time-consuming to conduct large-scale electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG)-based mouse sleep screening due to lengthy genetic crosses and labor-intensive surgeries. Here, we develop a highly efficient adult brain chimeric (ABC) expression/knockout (KO) platform and a highly accurate AI-augmented SleepV (video) system for high-througphut somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice. This ABC platform involves intravenous administration of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that bypass the blood brain barrier and transduce the majority of adult brain neurons. Constitutive or inducible ABC-expression of CREB and CRTC1 reduces both quantity and quality of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS), whereas ABC-KO of CREB by AAV-mediated Cre/loxP recombination increases daily NREMS amount. Moreover, ABC-KO of exon 13 of Sik3 by AAV-Cre injection of Sik3-E13flox/flox adult mice phenocopies Sleepy (Sik3Slp/Slp) mice, which carry a germline splicing mutation resulting in skipping of exon 13 of Sik3. While both long and short isoforms of SLP kinase contribute to, ABC-KO of Slp allele by CRISPR/Cas9 rescues the hypersomnia of Sik3Slp/+ mice. Double ABC-KO of orexin/hypocretin receptors by CRISPR/Cas9 results in chocolate-induced narcolepsy episodes. We envision that these somatic genetics approaches should facilitate efficient and sophisticated studies of many brain-related cellular, physiological and behavioral processes in adult mice without genetic crosses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: QSMxT: Robust Masking and Artefact Reduction for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.05.442850v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.05.442850v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Purpose: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is a post-processing technique applied to gradient-echo phase data. QSM algorithms require a signal mask to delineate regions with reliable phase signal for subsequent susceptibility estimation. Existing masking techniques used in QSM have limitations that introduce artefacts, exclude anatomical detail, and rely on parameter tuning and anatomical priors that narrow their application. Here, a robust masking and reconstruction procedure is presented to overcome these limitations and enable automated QSM processing for a wide range of use-cases implemented in an open-source software framework: QSMxT. Methods: A robust masking technique that automatically separates reliable from less reliable phase regions was developed and combined with a two-pass reconstruction procedure that operates on the separated sources before combination, extracting more information while reducing the influence of artefacts. Results: Compared with standard masking and reconstruction procedures, the two-pass inversion reduces streaking artefacts caused by unreliable phase and high dynamic ranges of susceptibility sources. QSMxT is robust across a range of datasets at 3 T in healthy volunteers and phantoms, at 7 T in tumour patients, and in the QSM challenge 2.0 simulated brain dataset, with significant artefact and error reductions, greater anatomical detail, and minimal parameter tuning. Conclusion: QSMxT generates masks for QSM that separate reliable from less reliable phase regions, enables a more accurate QSM reconstruction that mitigates artefacts, operates without anatomical priors, and requires minimal parameter tuning. QSMxT makes QSM processing more accessible, reliable and reproducible.</description>

	<description>Precision healthcare treats disease at its source, maximizing treatment efficacy while minimizing side effects. Transcranial focused ultrasound brings this methodology to the human brain, delivering focal interventions to deep brain sites without the need for surgeries. Depending on stimulus duration, ultrasound modulates neural activity-which is useful for systematic diagnoses of disease sources-or induces plastic changes and so a durable reset of the sources. In addition, ultrasound can be applied to selectively deliver drugs into specific targets, thus increasing treatment efficacy while sparing other tissues and organs from potential side effects. The agents can be delivered either across an intact blood brain barrier (small drugs) or across a blood brain barrier that is transiently opened by ultrasound (large drugs, genes, stem cells). Clinical translation of these groundbreaking approaches requires a practical system that can deliver ultrasound into specific brain targets on command. We developed a platform with these features and validated its function in nonhuman primates. In particular, we used the platform to modulate two deep brain nuclei-the left and the right lateral geniculate nucleus-during visual choice behavior. We found that specific stimulation parameters reliably yet reversibly modulated the choice behavior. This platform is being used to systematically investigate the space of effective stimulation parameters for transient and durable neuromodulation in nonhuman primates. This noninvasive system can also be applied to subjects with neurological and psychiatric disorders, to modulate specific deep brain targets with the precision and flexibility not previously possible.</description>

	<description>A fundamental challenge in the optogenetic toolbox is that all opsins, regardless of their excitation spectra, are activated by blue light. We hypothesized that pairing a red-shifted channelrhodopsin with a blue light-sensitive anion channel of appropriately matching kinetics shall render neurons responsive to a red but not blue light. To achieve this, we used a semi-rational mutagenesis strategy to optimize the kinetics and light spectrum of a chloride channelrhodopsin. By pairing optimized variants of blue light-sensitive anion channel ZipACR with vfChrimson, a fast red-shifted channelrhodopsin, we created a system in which red light derives precise and faithful action potentials of high frequencies, while blue light, through shunting inhibition, nullifies the effect of the red-shifted ChR2. Additionally, by a simple switch between red and blue lights, one can effectively excite or inhibit the activity of the same neurons.</description>

	<description>Pain perception is decreased by shifting attentional focus away from a threatening event. This attentional analgesia engages parallel descending control pathways from anterior cingulate (ACC) to locus coeruleus, and ACC to periaqueductal grey (PAG) - rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), indicating possible roles for noradrenergic or opioidergic neuromodulators. To determine which pathway modulates nociceptive activity in humans we used optimized whole brain-spinal cord pharmacological-fMRI (N=39) across three sessions. Noxious thermal forearm stimulation generated somatotopic-activation of dorsal horn (DH, C6 segment) whose activity mirrored attentional pain modulation. Activity in an adjacent cluster reported the interaction between task and noxious stimulus. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that ACC recruits PAG and RVM to modulate spinal cord activity. Blocking endogenous opioids with Naltrexone impairs attentional analgesia and disrupts RVM-DH and ACC-PAG connectivity. Noradrenergic augmentation with Reboxetine did not alter attentional analgesia. Cognitive pain modulation is mediated by opioidergic ACC-PAG-RVM descending control which supresses spinal nociceptive activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A novel mouse model of focal limbic seizures that reproduces behavioral impairment associated with cortical slow wave activity</title>

	<description>Patients with focal temporal lobe seizures often experience loss of consciousness. In humans, this loss of consciousness has been shown to be positively correlated with EEG neocortical slow waves, similar to those seen in non-REM sleep. Previous work in rat models of temporal lobe seizures suggests that decreased activity of subcortical arousal systems cause depressed cortical function during seizures. However, these studies were performed under light anesthesia, making it impossible to correlate behavior, and therefore consciousness, to electrophysiologic data. Further, the genetic and molecular toolkits allowing for precise study of the underlying neural circuitry are much more developed in mice than in rats. Here, we describe an awake-behaving, head-fixed mouse model of temporal lobe seizures with both spared and impaired behavior reflecting level of consciousness. Water-restricted mice were head-fixed on a running wheel and trained to associate an auditory stimulus to the delivery of a drop of water from a dispenser. To investigate the effect of seizures on behavior, seizures were electrically induced by stimulating either the left or right hippocampus via a chronically-implanted electrode, while mice were performing the task. Behavior was measured by monitoring lick responses to the auditory stimulus and running speed on the wheel. Further, local field potentials (LFP) signals were simultaneously recorded from hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Induced focal seizures were 5-30s in duration, and repeatable for several weeks (n=20 animals). Behavioral responses showed a decrease in lick rate to auditory stimulus, and decreased running speed during seizures (p&amp;lt;0.01, n=20 animals). Interestingly, licking response to sound could vary from being impaired to normal during seizures. We found that behavioral impairment is correlated with large amplitude cortical slow-wave activity in frontal cortex, as seen in patients with temporal lobe seizures. These results suggest that induced focal limbic seizures in the mouse can impair consciousness and that the impaired consciousness is correlated with depressed cortical function resembling slow wave sleep. This novel mouse model has similar characteristics with previously studied rat models and human temporal lobe seizures. By leveraging the genetic and molecular techniques available in the mouse, this model can be used to further uncover fundamental mechanisms for loss of consciousness in focal seizures.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Drug distribution along the cochlea is strongly enhanced by low-frequency round window micro vibrations</title>

	<description>The cochlea's inaccessibility and complex nature provide significant challenges to delivering drugs and other agents uniformly, safely and efficiently, along the entire cochlear spiral. Large drug concentration gradients are formed along the cochlea when drugs are administered to the middle ear. This undermines the major goal of attaining therapeutic drug concentration windows along the whole cochlea. Here, utilizing a well-known physiological effect of salicylate, we demonstrate a proof of concept in which drug distribution along the entire cochlea is enhanced applying round window membrane low-frequency micro vibrations with a probe that only partially covers the round window. We provide evidence of enhanced drug influx into the cochlea and cochlear apical drug distribution without breaching cochlear boundaries. It is further suggested that ossicular functionality is not required for the effective drug distribution we report. The novel method of local drug delivery to the cochlea presented here could be implemented when ossicular functionality is absent or impeded and can be incorporated in clinically approved auditory protheses for patients who suffer with conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss.</description>

	<description>Small average differences in the left-right asymmetry of cerebral cortical thickness have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing controls. Although these alterations affect multiple and widespread cortical regional asymmetries, the extent to which specific structural networks might be affected remains unknown. Inter-regional morphological covariance analysis can capture network connectivity relations between different cortical areas at the macroscale level. Here, we used cortical thickness data from 1,455 individuals with ASD and 1,560 controls, across 43 independent datasets of the ENIGMA consortium's ASD Working Group, to assess hemispheric asymmetries of intra-individual structural covariance networks, using graph theory-based topological metrics. Compared with typical features of small-world architecture in controls, the ASD sample showed significantly altered asymmetry of hemispheric networks involving the fusiform, rostral middle frontal, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, driven by shifts toward higher randomization of the corresponding right-hemispheric networks in ASD. A network involving the superior frontal cortex showed decreased right-hemisphere randomization. Based on comparisons with meta-analyzed functional neuroimaging data, the altered connectivity asymmetry particularly affected networks that subserve working memory, executive functions, language, reading, and sensorimotor processes. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into how altered brain left-right asymmetry in ASD affects specific structural and functional brain networks. Altered asymmetrical brain development in ASD may be partly propagated among spatially distant regions through structural connectivity.</description>

	<description>Decisions about what to eat recruit the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and involve the evaluation of food-related attributes, such as taste and health. These attributes are utilized differently by healthy individuals and patients with disordered eating behavior, but it is unclear whether these attributes are decodable from activity in the OFC in both groups and whether neural representations of these attributes are differentially related to decisions about food. We used fMRI combined with behavioral tasks to investigate the representation of taste and health in the human OFC and the role of these representations in food choices in healthy individuals and patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). We found that subjective ratings of taste and health could be decoded from patterns of activity in the OFC in both groups. However, health-related patterns of activity in the OFC were more related to food choices and the magnitude of preferences among patients with AN than healthy individuals. These findings suggest that maladaptive decision-making in AN is associated with more consideration of health information represented by the OFC during deliberation about what to eat.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex differences in gut microbiota modulation of aversive conditioning, open field activity, and basolateral amygdala dendritic spine density</title>

	<description>Adult female and male C57BL/6N mice voluntarily consumed either a 10‐day course of antimicrobials or a control (tap water). Results showed that the antimicrobials exerted sex‐specific effects on gut microbiome structure, open field behavior, cued aversive learning, and amygdala dendritic spine density (Figure created in https://biorender.com/).

Abstract
Gut microbiota influence numerous aspects of host biology, including brain structure and function. Growing evidence implicates gut microbiota in aversive conditioning and anxiety‐related behaviors, but research has focused almost exclusively on males. To investigate whether effects of gut dysbiosis on aversive learning and memory differ by sex, adult female and male C57BL/6N mice were orally administered a moderate dose of nonabsorbable antimicrobial medications (ATMs: neomycin, bacitracin, and pimaricin) or a control over 10 days. Changes in gut microbiome composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Open field behavior, cued aversive learning, context recall, and cued recall were assessed. Following behavioral testing, the morphology of basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neuron dendrites and spines was characterized. Results revealed that ATMs induced gut dysbiosis in both sexes, with stronger effects in females. ATMs also exerted sex‐specific effects on behavior and neuroanatomy. Males were more susceptible than females to microbial modulation of locomotor activity and anxiety‐like behavior. Females were more susceptible than males to ATM‐induced impairments in aversive learning and cued recall. Context recall remained intact, as did dendritic structure of BLA principal neurons. However, ATMs exerted a sex‐specific effect on spine density. A second experiment was conducted to isolate the effects of gut perturbation to cued recall. Extinction was also examined. Results revealed no effect of ATMs on cued recall or extinction, suggesting that gut dysbiosis preferentially impacts aversive learning. These data shed new light on how gut microbiota interact with sex to influence aversive conditioning, open field behavior, and BLA dendritic spine architecture.</description>

	<description>Haverkamp et al. use various cell markers to study the buzzard, pigeon, and marmoset retina. They compare marker expression, cell densities, and the cellular organization of foveae.







Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates that we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds are largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labeled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells, which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also in the retina of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.</description>

	<description>Peri‐stimulus time histogram of multiunit activity on attend‐toward (red) and attend‐away (blue) trials of the attention task. Multiunits from the same channel were sorted at low, medium, and high thresholds. Grey shading illustrates the data analysis window.






Abstract
Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.

	<description>We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role pf PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.






Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g. mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuropeptides as potential modulators of behavioral transitions in the ant Cataglyphis nodus</title>

	<description>We highlighted the spatial distribution of the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin and tachykinin in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus desert ants. We further show behavioral‐stage related changes in allatostatin‐A and corazonin expression patterns. The results suggest that these neuropeptides are highly promising candidate modulators for major behavioral transitions of the ants.






Abstract
Age‐related behavioral plasticity is a major prerequisite for the ecological success of insect societies. Although ecological aspects of behavioral flexibility have been targeted in many studies, the underlying intrinsic mechanisms controlling the diverse changes in behavior along the individual life history of social insects are not completely understood. Recently, the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin and tachykinin have been associated with the regulation of behavioral transitions in social insects. Here, we investigated changes in brain localization and expression of these neuropeptides following major behavioral transitions in Cataglyphis nodus ants. Our immunohistochemical analyses in the brain revealed that the overall branching pattern of neurons immunoreactive (ir) for the three neuropeptides is largely independent of the behavioral stages. Numerous allatostatin‐A‐ and tachykinin‐ir neurons innervate primary sensory neuropils and high‐order integration centers of the brain. In contrast, the number of corazonergic neurons is restricted to only four neurons per brain hemisphere with cell bodies located in the pars lateralis and axons extending to the medial protocerebrum and the retrocerebral complex. Most interestingly, the cell‐body volumes of these neurons are significantly increased in foragers compared to freshly eclosed ants and interior workers. Quantification of mRNA expression levels revealed a stage‐related change in the expression of allatostatin‐A and corazonin mRNA in the brain. Given the presence of the neuropeptides in major control centers of the brain and the neurohemal organs, these mRNA‐changes strongly suggest an important modulatory role of both neuropeptides in the behavioral maturation of Cataglyphis ants.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The hierarchical packing of euchromatin domains can be described as multiplicative cascades</title>

The genome is packed into the cell nucleus in the form of chromatin. Biochemical approaches have revealed that chromatin is packed within domains, which group into larger domains, and so forth. Such hierarchical packing is equally visible in super-resolution microscopy images of large-scale chromatin organization. While previous work has suggested that chromatin is partitioned into distinct domains via microphase separation, it is unclear how these domains organize into this hierarchical packing. A particular challenge is to find an image analysis approach that fully incorporates such hierarchical packing, so that hypothetical governing mechanisms of euchromatin packing can be compared against the results of such an analysis. Here, we obtain 3D STED super-resolution images from pluripotent zebrafish embryos labeled with improved DNA fluorescence stains, and demonstrate how the hierarchical packing of euchromatin in these images can be described as multiplicative cascades. Multiplicative cascades are an established theoretical concept to describe the placement of ever-smaller structures within bigger structures. Importantly, these cascades can generate artificial image data by applying a single rule again and again, and can be fully specified using only four parameters. Here, we show how the typical patterns of euchromatin organization are reflected in the values of these four parameters. Specifically, we can pinpoint the values required to mimic a microphase-separated state of euchromatin. We suggest that the concept of multiplicative cascades can also be applied to images of other types of chromatin. Here, cascade parameters could serve as test quantities to assess whether microphase separation or other theoretical models accurately reproduce the hierarchical packing of chromatin.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jqXxaaW7n1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The study of unconscious processing requires a measure of conscious awareness. Awareness measures can be either subjective (based on participant’s report) or objective (based on perceptual performance). The preferred awareness measure depends on the theoretical position about consciousness and may influence conclusions about the extent of unconscious processing and about the neural correlates of consciousness. We obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements from 43 subjects while they viewed masked faces and houses that were either subjectively or objectively invisible. Even for objectively invisible (perceptually indiscriminable) stimuli, we found significant category information in both early, lower-level visual areas and in higher-level visual cortex, although representations in anterior, category-selective ventrotemporal areas were less robust. For subjectively invisible stimuli, similar to visible stimuli, there was a clear posterior-to-anterior gradient in visual cortex, with stronger category information in ventrotemporal cortex than in early visual cortex. For objectively invisible stimuli, however, category information remained virtually unchanged from early visual cortex to object- and category-selective visual areas. These results demonstrate that although both objectively and subjectively invisible stimuli are represented in visual cortex, the extent of unconscious information processing is influenced by the measurement approach. Furthermore, our data show that subjective and objective approaches are associated with different neural correlates of consciousness and thus have implications for neural theories of consciousness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vSJuhJb1srA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In an effort to better utilize published evidence obtained from animal experiments, systematic reviews of preclinical studies are increasingly more common—along with the methods and tools to appraise them (e.g., SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation [SYRCLE’s] risk of bias tool). We performed a cross-sectional study of a sample of recent preclinical systematic reviews (2015–2018) and examined a range of epidemiological characteristics and used a 46-item checklist to assess reporting details. We identified 442 reviews published across 43 countries in 23 different disease domains that used 26 animal species. Reporting of key details to ensure transparency and reproducibility was inconsistent across reviews and within article sections. Items were most completely reported in the title, introduction, and results sections of the reviews, while least reported in the methods and discussion sections. Less than half of reviews reported that a risk of bias assessment for internal and external validity was undertaken, and none reported methods for evaluating construct validity. Our results demonstrate that a considerable number of preclinical systematic reviews investigating diverse topics have been conducted; however, their quality of reporting is inconsistent. Our study provides the justification and evidence to inform the development of guidelines for conducting and reporting preclinical systematic reviews.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VYEOpxi7m5U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mushroom bodies and reniform bodies coexisting in crabs cannot both be homologs of the insect mushroom body</title>

	<description>Abstract
In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae), a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body's morphology has been claimed as a homolog of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologs of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Encephalitis with autoantibodies against the glutamate kainate receptors GluK2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26098</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26098?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2/8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immunoabsorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or MRI features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis which in 2 caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (AMPAR and NMDAR) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinico‐radiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory-augmented neural networks equip a recurrent neural network with an
explicit memory to support tasks that require information storage without
interference over long times. A key motivation for such research is to perform
classic computation tasks, such as parsing. However, memory-augmented neural
networks are notoriously hard to train, requiring many backpropagation epochs
and a lot of data. In this paper, we introduce the reservoir stack machine, a
model which can provably recognize all deterministic context-free languages and
circumvents the training problem by training only the output layer of a
recurrent net and employing auxiliary information during training about the
desired interaction with a stack. In our experiments, we validate the reservoir
stack machine against deep and shallow networks from the literature on three
benchmark tasks for Neural Turing machines and six deterministic context-free
languages. Our results show that the reservoir stack machine achieves zero
error, even on test sequences longer than the training data, requiring only a
few seconds of training time and 100 training sequences.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring human capabilities to synchronize in time, adapt to perturbations
to timing sequences or reproduce time intervals often require experimental
setups that allow recording response times with millisecond precision. Most
setups present auditory stimuli using either MIDI devices or specialized
hardware such as Arduino and are often expensive or require calibration and
advanced programming skills. Here, we present in detail an experimental setup
that only requires an external sound card and minor electronic skills, works on
a conventional PC, is cheaper than alternatives and requires almost no
programming skills. It is intended for presenting any auditory stimuli and
recording tapping response times with within 2 milliseconds precision (up to
-2ms lag). This paper shows why desired accuracy in recording response times
against auditory stimuli is difficult to achieve in conventional computer
setups, presents an experimental setup to overcome this and explains in detail
how to set it up and use the provided code. Finally, the code for analyzing the
recorded tapping responses was evaluated, showing that no spurious or missing
events were found in 94% of the analyzed recordings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying the physiological processes in the central nervous system that
underlie our conscious experiences has been at the forefront of cognitive
neuroscience. While the principles of classical physics were long found to be
unaccommodating for a causally effective consciousness, the inherent
indeterminism of quantum physics, together with its characteristic dichotomy
between quantum states and quantum observables, provides a fertile ground for
the physical modeling of consciousness. Here, we utilize the Schr\&quot;odinger
equation, together with the Planck--Einstein relation between energy and
frequency, in order to determine the appropriate quantum dynamical timescale of
conscious processes. Furthermore, with the help of a simple two-qubit toy model
we illustrate the importance of non-zero interaction Hamiltonian for the
generation of quantum entanglement and manifestation of observable correlations
between different measurement outcomes. Employing a quantitative measure of
entanglement based on Schmidt decomposition, we show that quantum evolution
governed only by internal Hamiltonians for the individual quantum subsystems
preserves quantum coherence of separable initial quantum states, but eliminates
the possibility of any interaction and quantum entanglement. The presence of
non-zero interaction Hamiltonian, however, allows for decoherence of the
individual quantum subsystems along with their mutual interaction and quantum
entanglement. The presented results show that quantum coherence of individual
subsystems cannot be used for cognitive binding because it is a physical
mechanism that leads to separability and non-interaction. In contrast, quantum
interactions with their associated decoherence of individual subsystems are
instrumental for dynamical changes in the quantum entanglement of the composite
quantum state vector and manifested correlations of different observable
outcomes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nervous systems, like any organismal structure, have been shaped by
evolutionary processes to increase fitness. The resulting neural 'bauplan' has
to account for multiple objectives simultaneously, including computational
function as well as additional factors like robustness to environmental changes
and energetic limitations. Oftentimes these objectives compete and a
quantification of the relative impact of individual optimization targets is
non-trivial. Pareto optimality offers a theoretical framework to decipher
objectives and trade-offs between them. We, therefore, highlight Pareto theory
as a useful tool for the analysis of neurobiological systems, from
biophysically-detailed cells to large-scale network structures and behavior.
The Pareto approach can help to assess optimality, identify relevant objectives
and their respective impact, and formulate testable hypotheses.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;C. elegans shows chemotaxis using klinokinesis where the worm senses the
concentration based on a single concentration sensor to compute the
concentration gradient to perform foraging through gradient ascent/descent
towards the target concentration followed by contour tracking. The biomimetic
implementation requires complex neurons with multiple ion channel dynamics as
well as interneurons for control. While this is a key capability of autonomous
robots, its implementation on energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware like
Intel's Loihi requires adaptation of the network to hardware-specific
constraints, which has not been achieved. In this paper, we demonstrate the
adaptation of chemotaxis based on klinokinesis to Loihi by implementing
necessary neuronal dynamics with only LIF neurons as well as a complete
spike-based implementation of all functions e.g. Heaviside function and
subtractions. Our results show that Loihi implementation is equivalent to the
software counterpart on Python in terms of performance - both during foraging
and contour tracking. The Loihi results are also resilient in noisy
environments. Thus, we demonstrate a successful adaptation of chemotaxis on
Loihi - which can now be combined with the rich array of SNN blocks for SNN
based complex robotic control.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Self-Supervised Approach for Facial Movement Based Optical Flow. (arXiv:2105.01256v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01256</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01256</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computing optical flow is a fundamental problem in computer vision. However,
deep learning-based optical flow techniques do not perform well for non-rigid
movements such as those found in faces, primarily due to lack of the training
data representing the fine facial motion. We hypothesize that learning optical
flow on face motion data will improve the quality of predicted flow on faces.
The aim of this work is threefold: (1) exploring self-supervised techniques to
generate optical flow ground truth for face images; (2) computing baseline
results on the effects of using face data to train Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) for predicting optical flow; and (3) using the learned optical
flow in micro-expression recognition to demonstrate its effectiveness. We
generate optical flow ground truth using facial key-points in the
BP4D-Spontaneous dataset. The generated optical flow is used to train the
FlowNetS architecture to test its performance on the generated dataset. The
performance of FlowNetS trained on face images surpassed that of other optical
flow CNN architectures, demonstrating its usefulness. Our optical flow features
are further compared with other methods using the STSTNet micro-expression
classifier, and the results indicate that the optical flow obtained using this
work has promising applications in facial expression analysis.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Metastable spiking networks in the replica-mean-field limit. (arXiv:2105.01223v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01223</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Characterizing metastable neural dynamics in finite-size spiking networks
remains a daunting challenge. We propose to address this challenge in the
recently introduced replica-mean-field (RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are
made of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of interest, but with
randomized interactions across replica. Such randomization renders certain
excitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity
correlations, but with explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural
constituents. However, metastable dynamics typically unfold in networks with
mixed inhibition and excitation. Here, we extend the RMF computational
framework to point-process-based neural network models with exponential
stochastic intensities, allowing for mixed excitation and inhibition. Within
this setting, we show that metastable finite-size networks admit multistable
RMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates.
Technically, these stationary rates are determined as solutions to a set of
delayed differential equations under certain regularity conditions that any
physical solutions shall satisfy. We solve this original problem by combining
the resolvent formalism and singular-perturbation theory. Importantly, we find
that these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately
capture the neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We
also discuss the emergence of metastability as a stochastic bifurcation, which
can also be interpreted as a static phase transition in the RMF limits. In
turn, we expect to leverage the static picture of RMF limits to infer purely
dynamical features of metastable finite-size networks, such as the transition
rates between pseudo-equilibria.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biclustering is a data mining technique which searches for local patterns in
numeric tabular data with main application in bioinformatics. This technique
has shown promise in multiple areas, including development of biomarkers for
cancer, disease subtype identification, or gene-drug interactions among others.
In this paper we introduce EBIC.JL - an implementation of one of the most
accurate biclustering algorithms in Julia, a modern highly parallelizable
programming language for data science. We show that the new version maintains
comparable accuracy to its predecessor EBIC while converging faster for the
majority of the problems. We hope that this open source software in a
high-level programming language will foster research in this promising field of
bioinformatics and expedite development of new biclustering methods for big
data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many mathematical optimization algorithms fail to sufficiently explore the
solution space of high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems due to the
curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes generative models as a complement
to optimization algorithms to improve performance in problems with high
dimensionality. To demonstrate this method, a conditional generative
adversarial network (C-GAN) is used to augment the solutions produced by a
genetic algorithm (GA) for a 311-dimensional nonconvex multi-objective
mixed-integer nonlinear optimization. The C-GAN, composed of two networks with
three fully connected hidden layers, is trained on solutions generated by GA,
and then given sets of desired labels (i.e., objective function values),
generates complementary solutions corresponding to those labels. Six
experiments are conducted to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed method.
The generated complementary solutions are compared to the original solutions in
terms of optimality and diversity. The generative model generates solutions
with objective functions up to 100% better, and with hypervolumes up to 100%
higher, than the original solutions. These findings show that a C-GAN with even
a simple training approach and architecture can, with a much shorter runtime,
highly improve the diversity and optimality of solutions found by an
optimization algorithm for a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We currently observe a disconcerting phenomenon in machine learning studies
in psychiatry: While we would expect larger samples to yield better results due
to the availability of more data, larger machine learning studies consistently
show much weaker performance than the numerous small-scale studies. Here, we
systematically investigated this effect focusing on one of the most heavily
studied questions in the field, namely the classification of patients suffering
from major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy control (HC) based on
neuroimaging data. Drawing upon structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data from a balanced sample of $N = 1,868$ MDD patients and HC from our recent
international Predictive Analytics Competition (PAC), we first trained and
tested a classification model on the full dataset which yielded an accuracy of
$61\,\%$. Next, we mimicked the process by which researchers would draw samples
of various sizes ($N = 4$ to $N = 150$) from the population and showed a strong
risk of misestimation. Specifically, for small sample sizes ($N = 20$), we
observe accuracies of up to $95\,\%$. For medium sample sizes ($N = 100$)
accuracies up to $75\,\%$ were found. Importantly, further investigation showed
that sufficiently large test sets effectively protect against performance
misestimation whereas larger datasets per se do not. While these results
question the validity of a substantial part of the current literature, we
outline the relatively low-cost remedy of larger test sets, which is readily
available in most cases.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: BGADAM: Boosting based Genetic-Evolutionary ADAM for Neural Network Optimization. (arXiv:1908.08015v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08015</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For various optimization methods, gradient descent-based algorithms can
achieve outstanding performance and have been widely used in various tasks.
Among those commonly used algorithms, ADAM owns many advantages such as fast
convergence with both the momentum term and the adaptive learning rate.
However, since the loss functions of most deep neural networks are non-convex,
ADAM also shares the drawback of getting stuck in local optima easily. To
resolve such a problem, the idea of combining genetic algorithm with base
learners is introduced to rediscover the best solutions. Nonetheless, from our
analysis, the idea of combining genetic algorithm with a batch of base learners
still has its shortcomings. The effectiveness of genetic algorithm can hardly
be guaranteed if the unit models converge to close or the same solutions. To
resolve this problem and further maximize the advantages of genetic algorithm
with base learners, we propose to implement the boosting strategy for input
model training, which can subsequently improve the effectiveness of genetic
algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization algorithm, namely
Boosting based Genetic ADAM (BGADAM). With both theoretic analysis and
empirical experiments, we will show that adding the boosting strategy into the
BGADAM model can help models jump out the local optima and converge to better
solutions.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Power of Linear Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1802.03308v5 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03308</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03308</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks are a powerful means to cope with time series. We
show how linear, i.e., linearly activated recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) can
approximate any time-dependent function f(t) given by a number of function
values. The approximation can effectively be learned by simply solving a linear
equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods are needed. Furthermore,
the size of an LRNN can be reduced significantly in one step, after inspecting
the eigenvalues of the network transition matrix, by taking only the most
relevant components. Therefore, in contrast to others, we do not only learn
network weights but also the network architecture. LRNNs have interesting
properties: They end up in ellipse trajectories in the long run and allow the
prediction of further values and compact representations of functions. We
demonstrate this by several experiments, among them multiple superimposed
oscillators (MSO), robotic soccer, and predicting stock prices. LRNNs
outperform the previous state-of-the-art for the MSO task with a minimal number
of units.

	<title>Nature Communications: A call for caution in analysing mammalian co-transfection experiments and implications of resource competition in data misinterpretation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 05 May 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22795-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-021-22795-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Transient transfections are routinely used in basic and synthetic biology studies to unravel pathway regulation and to probe and characterise circuit designs. As each experiment has a component of intrinsic variability, reporter gene expression is usually normalized with co-delivered genes that act as transfection controls. Recent reports in mammalian cells highlight how resource competition for gene expression leads to biases in data interpretation, with a direct impact on co-transfection experiments. Here we define the connection between resource competition and transient transfection experiments and discuss possible alternatives. Our aim is to raise awareness within the community and stimulate discussion to include such considerations in future experimental designs, for the development of better transfection controls.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/I_lghU7YorI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 05 May 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22737-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-021-22737-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A mutation in Shugoshin-1 causes the Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) Syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, the authors show that Shugoshin-1 controls cardiac pacemaker activity by interacting with HCN4 to enhance its cell-surface expression, and that the CAID-Syndrome mutation disrupts cardiac pacemaking by interfering with this important non-canonical interaction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/QEz_n__Hd1w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic on patients with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID‐19 on migraine management.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. An increase in telehealth consultations with specialists was reported in the survey but migraine patients preferred face-to-face consultations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development and function of the central nervous system rely on the microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons and their respective effectors. Although the structural role of the cytoskeleton has long been acknowledged in neuronal morphology and activity, it was recently recognized to play the role of a signaling platform. Following this recognition, research into Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs) diversified. Indeed, historically, structural MAPs—including MAP1B, MAP2, Tau, and MAP6 (also known as STOP);—were identified and described as MT-binding and -stabilizing proteins. Extensive data obtained over the last 20 years indicated that these structural MAPs could also contribute to a variety of other molecular roles. Among multi-role MAPs, MAP6 provides a striking example illustrating the diverse molecular and cellular properties of MAPs and showing how their functional versatility contributes to the central nervous system. In this review, in addition to MAP6’s effect on microtubules, we describe its impact on the actin cytoskeleton, on neuroreceptor homeostasis, and its involvement in signaling pathways governing neuron development and maturation. We also discuss its roles in synaptic plasticity, brain connectivity, and cognitive abilities, as well as the potential relationships between the integrated brain functions of MAP6 and its molecular activities. In parallel, the Collapsin Response Mediator Proteins (CRMPs) are presented as examples of how other proteins, not initially identified as MAPs, fall into the broader MAP family. These proteins bind MTs as well as exhibiting molecular and cellular properties very similar to MAP6. Finally, we briefly summarize the multiple similarities between other classical structural MAPs and MAP6 or CRMPs.In summary, this review revisits the molecular properties and the cellular and neuronal roles of the classical MAPs, broadening our definition of what constitutes a MAP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Environmental Enrichment Induces Epigenomic and Genome Organization Changes Relevant for Cognition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In early development, the environment triggers mnemonic epigenomic programs resulting in memory and learning experiences to confer cognitive phenotypes into adulthood. To uncover how environmental stimulation impacts the epigenome and genome organization, we used the paradigm of environmental enrichment (EE) in young mice constantly receiving novel stimulation. We profiled epigenome and chromatin architecture in whole cortex and sorted neurons by deep-sequencing techniques. Specifically, we studied chromatin accessibility, gene and protein regulation, and 3D genome conformation, combined with predicted enhancer and chromatin interactions. We identified increased chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding including CTCF-mediated insulation, differential occupancy of H3K36me3 and H3K79me2, and changes in transcriptional programs required for neuronal development. EE stimuli led to local genome re-organization by inducing increased contacts between chromosomes 7 and 17 (inter-chromosomal). Our findings support the notion that EE-induced learning and memory processes are directly associated with the epigenome and genome organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Val66 and Met66 Alleles-Specific Expression of BDNF in Human Muscle and Their Metabolic Responsivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.638176</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in nervous system formation and functioning, including metabolism. Present only in humans, the “Val66Met” polymorphism of the BDNF gene (BDNF) is suggested to have a negative influence on the etiology of neurological diseases. However, this polymorphism has only been addressed, at the molecular level, in nonhuman models. Knowledge about Val66- and Met66-variant differences, to date, has been achieved at the protein level using either cell culture or animal models. Thus, the purpose of our study was to analyze the impact of the Val66Met polymorphism on BDNF expression in healthy humans and compare the allele-specific responses to metabolic stress. Muscle biopsies from 13 male recreational athletes (34 ± 9 years, 1.80 ± 0.08 m, 76.4 ± 10.5 kg) were obtained before and immediately following a VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max test. Allele-specific BDNF mRNA concentrations were quantified by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in heterozygous and homozygous subjects. The results indicated that BDNF expression levels were influenced by the genotype according to the presence of the polymorphism. BDNF expression from the Met66-coding alleles, in heterozygotes, was 1.3-fold lower than that from the Val66-coding alleles. Total BDNF mRNA levels in these heterozygotes remained below the whole sample’s mean. A partial dominance was detected for the Val66-coding variant on the Met66-coding’s. BDNF expression levels decreased by an average of 1.8-fold following the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max test, independent of the individual’s genotype. The results of this study indicate that metabolic stress downregulates BDNF expression but not plasma BDNF concentrations. No correlation between expression level and plasma BDNF concentrations was found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A New Method of Haemorrhagic Stroke Detection Via Deep Magnetic Induction Tomography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.659095</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hemorrhage imaging is one of the most common applications of magnetic induction tomography (MIT). Depth and the mass of stroke stimulated (MSS) are the most important issues that need to be solved for this application. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique belonging to the deep brain stimulation (DBS) field, which aims at overcoming human diseases such as depression. TMS coils, namely, circular, figure-8, and H-coils, play an important role in TMS. Among these, H-coils individually focus on the issues of achieving effective stimulation of deep region. MIT and TMS mechanisms are similar. Herein, for the first time, improved TMS coils, including figure-8 and H-coils, are applied as MIT excitation coils to study the possibility of achieving the mass of stroke stimulated and deep detection through MIT. In addition, the configurations of the detection coils are varied to analyze their influence and determine the optimal coils array. Finally, MIT is used to detect haemorrhagic stroke occurring in humans, and the application of deep MIT to the haemorrhagic stroke problem is computationally explored. Results show that among the various coils, the improved H-coils have MSS and depth characteristics that enable the detection of deep strokes through MIT. Although the detecting depth of the figure-8 coil is weaker, its surface signal is good. The deep MIT technique can be applied to haemorrhagic detection, providing a critical base for deeper research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Can Deep Learning Hit a Moving Target? A Scoping Review of Its Role to Study Neurological Disorders in Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.670489</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurological disorders dramatically impact patients of any age population, their families, and societies. Pediatrics are among vulnerable age populations who differently experience the devastating consequences of neurological conditions, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), cerebral palsy, concussion, and epilepsy. System-level understanding of these neurological disorders, particularly from the brain networks' dynamic perspective, has led to the significant trend of recent scientific investigations. While a dramatic maturation in the network science application domain is evident, leading to a better understanding of neurological disorders, such rapid utilization for studying pediatric neurological disorders falls behind that of the adult population. Aside from the specific technological needs and constraints in studying neurological disorders in children, the concept of development introduces uncertainty and further complexity topping the existing neurologically driven processes caused by disorders. To unravel these complexities, indebted to the availability of high-dimensional data and computing capabilities, approaches based on machine learning have rapidly emerged a new trend to understand pathways better, accurately diagnose, and better manage the disorders. Deep learning has recently gained an ever-increasing role in the era of health and medical investigations. Thanks to its relatively more minor dependency on feature exploration and engineering, deep learning may overcome the challenges mentioned earlier in studying neurological disorders in children. The current scoping review aims to explore challenges concerning pediatric brain development studies under the constraints of neurological disorders and offer an insight into the potential role of deep learning methodology on such a task with varying and uncertain nature. Along with pinpointing recent advancements, possible research directions are highlighted where deep learning approaches can assist in computationally targeting neurological disorder-related processes and translating them into windows of opportunities for interventions in diagnosis, treatment, and management of neurological disorders in children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cumulative knowledge of retina development has been instrumental in the generation of retinal organoid systems from pluripotent stem cells; and these three-dimensional organoid models, in turn, have provided unprecedented opportunities for retinal research and translational applications, including the ability to model disease in a human setting and to apply these models to the development and validation of therapeutic drugs. In this review article, we examine how retinal organoids can also contribute to our understanding of retinal developmental mechanisms, how this knowledge can be applied to modeling developmental abnormalities, and highlight some of the avenues that remain to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Effect of Low-Dose Atropine on Alpha Ganglion Cell Signaling in the Mouse Retina</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low-dose atropine helps to control myopia progression with few side effects. However, the impact of atropine, a non-selective muscarinic Acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) remains unclear. After immersing the cornea and adjacent conjunctiva of enucleated eyes in 0.05% (approximately 800 μM) atropine solution for 30 min, the atropine concentration reached in the retina was below 2 μM. After direct superfusion of the retina with 1 μM atropine (considering that the clinical application of 0.05% atropine eye drops will be diluted over time due to tear flow for 30 min), no noticeable changes in the morphology of ON and OFF alpha RGCs (αRGCs) were observed. Atropine affected the light-evoked responses of ON and OFF αRGCs in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Direct application of less than 100 μM atropine on the retina did not affect light-evoked responses. The time latency of light-induced responses of ON or OFF αRGCs did not change after the application of 0.05–100 μM atropine for 5 min. However, 50 μM atropine extended the threshold of joint inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution of the RGCs. These results indicated that low-dose atropine (&amp;lt;0.5 μM; equal to 1% atropine topical application) did not interfere with spike frequency, the pattern of synchronized firing between OFF αRGCs, or the threshold of joint ISI distribution of αRGCs. The application of atropine unmasked inhibition to induce ON responses from certain OFF RGCs, possibly via the GABAergic pathway, potentially affecting visual information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Integrative Cell Type-Specific Multi-Omics Approaches Reveal Impaired Programs of Glial Cell Differentiation in Mouse Culture Models of DM1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a non-coding CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. This mutation generates a toxic CUG RNA that interferes with the RNA processing of target genes in multiple tissues. Despite debilitating neurological impairment, the pathophysiological cascade of molecular and cellular events in the central nervous system (CNS) has been less extensively characterized than the molecular pathogenesis of muscle/cardiac dysfunction. Particularly, the contribution of different cell types to DM1 brain disease is not clearly understood. We first used transcriptomics to compare the impact of expanded CUG RNA on the transcriptome of primary neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes derived from DMSXL mice, a transgenic model of DM1. RNA sequencing revealed more frequent expression and splicing changes in glia than neuronal cells. In particular, primary DMSXL oligodendrocytes showed the highest number of transcripts differentially expressed, while DMSXL astrocytes displayed the most severe splicing dysregulation. Interestingly, the expression and splicing defects of DMSXL glia recreated molecular signatures suggestive of impaired cell differentiation: while DMSXL oligodendrocytes failed to upregulate a subset of genes that are naturally activated during the oligodendroglia differentiation, a significant proportion of missplicing events in DMSXL oligodendrocytes and astrocytes increased the expression of RNA isoforms typical of precursor cell stages. Together these data suggest that expanded CUG RNA in glial cells affects preferentially differentiation-regulated molecular events. This hypothesis was corroborated by gene ontology (GO) analyses, which revealed an enrichment for biological processes and cellular components with critical roles during cell differentiation. Finally, we combined exon ontology with phosphoproteomics and cell imaging to explore the functional impact of CUG-associated spliceopathy on downstream protein metabolism. Changes in phosphorylation, protein isoform expression and intracellular localization in DMSXL astrocytes demonstrate the far-reaching impact of the DM1 repeat expansion on cell metabolism. Our multi-omics approaches provide insight into the mechanisms of CUG RNA toxicity in the CNS with cell type resolution, and support the priority for future research on non-neuronal mechanisms and proteomic changes in DM1 brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: C9ORF72: What It Is, What It Does, and Why It Matters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661447</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661447</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When the non-coding repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene was discovered to be the most frequent cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2011, this gene and its derived protein, C9ORF72, were completely unknown. The mutation appeared to produce both haploinsufficiency and gain-of-function effects in the form of aggregating expanded RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). An unprecedented effort was then unleashed to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms and the functions of C9ORF72 in order to design therapies. A decade later, while the toxicity of accumulating gain-of-function products has been established and therapeutic strategies are being developed to target it, the contribution of the loss of function starts to appear more clearly. This article reviews the current knowledge about the C9ORF72 protein, how it is affected by the repeat expansion in models and patients, and what could be the contribution of its haploinsufficiency to the disease in light of the most recent findings. We suggest that these elements should be taken into consideration to refine future therapeutic strategies, compensating for the decrease of C9ORF72 or at least preventing a further reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopamine-Mediated Circadian and Light/Dark-Adaptive Modulation of Chemical and Electrical Synapses in the Outer Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647541</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The vertebrate retina, like most other brain regions, undergoes relatively slow alterations in neural signaling in response to gradual changes in physiological conditions (e.g., activity changes to rest), or in response to gradual changes in environmental conditions (e.g., day changes into night). As occurs elsewhere in the brain, the modulatory processes that mediate slow adaptation in the retina are driven by extrinsic signals (e.g., changes in ambient light level) and/or by intrinsic signals such as those of the circadian (24-h) clock in the retina. This review article describes and discusses the extrinsic and intrinsic modulatory processes that enable neural circuits in the retina to optimize their visual performance throughout day and night as the ambient light level changes by ~10 billion-fold. In the first synaptic layer of the retina, cone photoreceptor cells form gap junctions with rods and signal cone-bipolar and horizontal cells (HCs). Distinct extrinsic and intrinsic modulatory processes in this synaptic layer are mediated by long-range feedback of the neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is released by dopaminergic cells, interneurons whose cell bodies are located in the second synaptic layer of the retina. Distinct actions of dopamine modulate chemical and electrical synapses in day and night. The retinal circadian clock increases dopamine release in the day compared to night, activating high-affinity dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on cones. This clock effect controls electrical synapses between rods and cones so that rod-cone electrical coupling is minimal in the day and robust at night. The increase in rod-cone coupling at night improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the reliability of very dim multi-photon light responses, thereby enhancing detection of large dim objects on moonless nights.Conversely, maintained (30 min) bright illumination in the day compared to maintained darkness releases sufficient dopamine to activate low-affinity dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on cone-bipolar cell dendrites. This non-circadian light/dark adaptive process regulates the function of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on ON-cone-bipolar cell dendrites so that the receptive field (RF) surround of the cells is strong following maintained bright illumination but minimal following maintained darkness. The increase in surround strength in the day following maintained bright illumination enhances the detection of edges and fine spatial details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Development of the Entorhinal Cortex Occurs via Parallel Lamination During Neurogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.663667</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the spatial processing center of the brain and structurally is an interface between the three layered paleocortex and six layered neocortex, known as the periarchicortex. Limited studies indicate peculiarities in the formation of the EC such as early emergence of cells in layers (L) II and late deposition of LIII, as well as divergence in the timing of maturation of cell types in the superficial layers. In this study, we examine developmental events in the entorhinal cortex using an understudied model in neuroanatomy and development, the pig and supplement the research with BrdU labeling in the developing mouse EC. We determine the pig serves as an excellent anatomical model for studying human neurogenesis, given its long gestational length, presence of a moderate sized outer subventricular zone and early cessation of neurogenesis during gestation. Immunohistochemistry identified prominent clusters of OLIG2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligoprogenitor-like cells in the superficial layers of the lateral EC (LEC) that are sparser in the medial EC (MEC). These are first detected in the subplate during the early second trimester. MRI analyses reveal an acceleration of EC growth at the end of the second trimester. BrdU labeling of the developing MEC, shows the deeper layers form first and prior to the superficial layers, but the LV/VI emerges in parallel and the LII/III emerges later, but also in parallel. We coin this lamination pattern parallel lamination. The early born Reln&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stellate cells in the superficial layers express the classic LV marker, Bcl11b (Ctip2) and arise from a common progenitor that forms the late deep layer LV neurons. In summary, we characterize the developing EC in a novel animal model and outline in detail the formation of the EC. We further provide insight into how the periarchicortex forms in the brain, which differs remarkably to the inside-out lamination of the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cholinergic system has been shown to be the primary neurotransmitter system which is responsible for the cognitive symptoms associated with dementia; its role in healthy non-demented older adults remains a gap in the literature. Understanding the effects of age-related functional changes on the nicotinic system will address this knowledge gap. As the older adult population grows and hence the importance of understanding cognitive changes that impact functional abilities and everyday life. In this article we examine the benefits of using nicotine as a method for improving cognition in non-demented healthy older adults which may have the potential for slowing neurodegeneration in aging. Furthermore, we discuss how nicotine can play a crucial role in maintaining cognitive abilities throughout normal cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.586999</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Virtual reality (VR) intervention is an innovative and efficient rehabilitative tool for patients affected by stroke, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological disorders. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of VR intervention on cognition and motor function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published from inception to April 2020. Randomized controlled trials examining VR intervention in adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia aged &amp;gt;60 years were included. The primary outcome of the study was cognitive function, including overall cognition, global cognition, attention, executive function, memory, and visuospatial ability. The secondary outcome was motor function, consisting of overall motor function, balance, and gait. A subgroup analysis was also performed based on study characteristics to identify the potential factors for heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eleven studies including 359 participants were included for final analysis. Primary analysis showed a significant moderate positive effect size (ES) of VR on overall cognition (g = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31–0.59; P &amp;lt; 0.001), attention/execution (g = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.26–0.72; P &amp;lt; 0.001), memory (g = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.29–0.85; P &amp;lt; 0.001), and global cognition (g = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.06–0.58; P = 0.02). Secondary analysis showed a significant small positive ES on overall motor function (g = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.05–0.51; P = 0.018). The ES on balance (g = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.06–0.80; P = 0.02) was significant and moderate. The ES on visuospatial ability and gait was not significant. In the subgroup analysis, heterogeneity was detected in type of immersion and population diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: VR intervention is a beneficial non-pharmacological approach to improve cognitive and motor function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, especially in attention/execution, memory, global cognition, and balance. VR intervention does not show superiority on visuospatial ability and gait performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Ir56d-dependent fatty acid responses in Drosophila uncovers taste discrimination between different classes of fatty acids</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67878</guid>

	<description>Chemosensory systems are critical for evaluating the caloric value and potential toxicity of food prior to ingestion. While animals can discriminate between 1000's of odors, much less is known about the discriminative capabilities of taste systems. Fats and sugars represent calorically potent and innately attractive food sources that contribute to hedonic feeding. Despite the differences in nutritional value between fats and sugars, the ability of the taste system to discriminate between different rewarding tastants is thought to be limited. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, sweet taste neurons expressing the Ionotropic Receptor 56d (&lt;i&gt;IR56d&lt;/i&gt;) are required for reflexive behavioral responses to the medium-chain fatty acid, hexanoic acid. Further, we have found that flies can discriminate between a fatty acid and a sugar in aversive memory assays, establishing a foundation to investigate the capacity of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; gustatory system to differentiate between various appetitive tastants. Here, we tested whether flies can discriminate between different classes of fatty acids using an aversive memory assay. Our results indicate that flies are able to discriminate medium-chain fatty acids from both short- and long-chain fatty acids, but not from other medium-chain fatty acids. While &lt;i&gt;IR56d&lt;/i&gt; neurons are broadly responsive to short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids, genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;IR56d&lt;/i&gt; selectively disrupts response to medium-chain fatty acids. Further, &lt;i&gt;IR56d+GR64f+&lt;/i&gt; neurons are necessary for proboscis extension response (PER) to medium-chain fatty acids, but both &lt;i&gt;IR56d&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GR64f&lt;/i&gt; neurons are dispensable for PER to short- and long-chain fatty acids, indicating the involvement of one or more other classes of neurons. Together, these findings reveal that &lt;i&gt;IR56d&lt;/i&gt; is selectively required for medium-chain fatty acid taste, and discrimination of fatty acids occurs through differential receptor activation in shared populations of neurons. Our study uncovers a capacity for the taste system to encode tastant identity within a taste category.</description>

	<title>eLife: Genetic variation, environment and demography intersect to shape Arabidopsis defense metabolite variation across Europe</title>

	<description>Plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with the challenges presented by complex and ever-changing environments. These challenges drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species. However, we are just beginning to understand how frequently new alleles arise controlling specialized metabolite diversity and how the geographic distribution of these alleles may be structured by ecological and demographic pressures. Here we measure the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; accessions. We show a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and different genetic processes all combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This showed that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within species convergence. This provides a new perspective about the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation.</description>

	<title>eLife: The LRR-TM protein PAN-1 interacts with MYRF to promote its nuclear translocation in synaptic remodeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67628</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67628</link>
	<description>Neural circuits develop through a plastic phase orchestrated by genetic programs and environmental signals. We have identified a leucine-rich-repeat domain transmembrane protein PAN-1 as a factor required for synaptic rewiring in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. PAN-1 localizes on cell membrane and binds with MYRF, a membrane-bound transcription factor indispensable for promoting synaptic rewiring. Full-length MYRF was known to undergo self-cleavage on ER membrane and release its transcriptional N-terminal fragment in cultured cells. We surprisingly find that MYRF trafficking to cell membrane before cleavage is pivotal for &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; development and the timing of N-MYRF release coincides with the onset of synaptic rewiring. On cell membrane PAN-1 and MYRF interact with each other via their extracellular regions. Loss of PAN-1 abolishes MYRF cell membrane localization, consequently blocking &lt;i&gt;myrf&lt;/i&gt;-dependent neuronal rewiring process. Thus, through interactions with a cooperating factor on the cell membrane, MYRF may link cell surface activities to transcriptional cascades required for development.</description>

	<title>eLife: Myoglobin primary structure reveals multiple convergent transitions to semi-aquatic life in the world's smallest mammalian divers</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66797</link>
	<description>The speciose mammalian order Eulipotyphla (moles, shrews, hedgehogs, solenodons) combines an unusual diversity of semi-aquatic, semi-fossorial, and fossorial forms that arose from terrestrial forbearers. However, our understanding of the ecomorphological pathways leading to these lifestyles has been confounded by a fragmentary fossil record, unresolved phylogenetic relationships, and potential morphological convergence, calling for novel approaches. The net surface charge of the oxygen-storing muscle protein myoglobin (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Mb&lt;/sub&gt;), which can be readily determined from its primary structure, provides an objective target to address this question due to mechanistic linkages with myoglobin concentration. Here we generate a comprehensive 71 species molecular phylogeny that resolves previously intractable intra-family relationships and then ancestrally reconstruct &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Mb&lt;/sub&gt; evolution to identify ancient lifestyle transitions based on protein sequence alone. Our phylogenetically informed analyses confidently resolve fossorial habits having evolved twice in talpid moles and reveal five independent secondary aquatic transitions in the order housing the world's smallest endothermic divers.</description>

	<title>eLife: CM1-driven assembly and activation of yeast γ-tubulin small complex underlies microtubule nucleation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65168</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65168</link>
	<description>Microtubule (MT) nucleation is regulated by the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), conserved from yeast to humans. In &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, γTuRC is composed of seven identical γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) sub-assemblies, which associate helically to template MT growth. γTuRC assembly provides a key point of regulation for the MT cytoskeleton. Here, we combine crosslinking mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-EM structures of both monomeric and dimeric γTuSCs, and open and closed helical γTuRC assemblies in complex with Spc110p to elucidate the mechanisms of γTuRC assembly. γTuRC assembly is substantially aided by the evolutionarily conserved CM1 motif in Spc110p spanning a pair of adjacent γTuSCs. By providing the highest resolution and most complete views of any γTuSC assembly, our structures allow phosphorylation sites to be mapped, surprisingly suggesting that they are mostly inhibitory. A comparison of our structures with the CM1 binding site in the human γTuRC structure at the interface between GCP2 and GCP6 allows for the interpretation of significant structural changes arising from CM1 helix binding to metazoan γTuRC.</description>

	<title>eLife: SAM homeostasis is regulated by CFIm-mediated splicing of MAT2A</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64930</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64930</link>
	<description>S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the methyl donor for nearly all cellular methylation events. Cells regulate intracellular SAM levels through intron detention of MAT2A, the only SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. The N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-adenosine methyltransferase METTL16 promotes splicing of the MAT2A detained intron by an unknown mechanism. Using an unbiased CRISPR knock-out screen, we identified CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;25 (NUDT21) as a regulator of MAT2A intron detention and intracellular SAM levels. CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;25 is a component of the cleavage factor Im (CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) complex that regulates poly(A) site selection, but we show it promotes MAT2A splicing independent of poly(A) site selection. CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;25-mediated MAT2A splicing induction requires the RS domains of its binding partners, CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;68 and CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;59 as well as binding sites in the detained intron and 3´ UTR. These studies uncover mechanisms that regulate MAT2A intron detention and reveal a previously undescribed role for CFI&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; in splicing and SAM metabolism.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64567</link>
	<description>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its abundant connections with other brain regions play key roles in memory, cognition, decision making, social behaviors, and mood. Dysfunction in mPFC is implicated in psychiatric disorders in which these behaviors go awry. The prolonged maturation of mPFC likely enables complex behaviors to emerge, but also increases their vulnerability to disruption. Many foundational studies have characterized either mPFC synaptic or behavioral development without establishing connections between them. Here, we review this rich body of literature, aligning major events in mPFC development with the maturation of complex behaviors. We focus on emotional memory and cognitive flexibility, and highlight new work linking mPFC circuit disruption to alterations of these behaviors in disease models. We advance new hypotheses about the causal connections between mPFC synaptic development and behavioral maturation and propose research strategies to establish an integrated understanding of neural architecture and behavioral repertoires.</description>

	<title>eLife: Combinatorial deployment of F-actin regulators to build complex 3D actin structures in vivo</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63046</link>
	<description>Despite extensive studies on the actin regulators that direct microfilament dynamics, how these regulators are combinatorially utilized in organismal tissues to generate 3D structures is an unresolved question. Here, we present an in-depth characterization of cortical actin cap dynamics and their regulation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We identify rapid phases of initiation, expansion, duplication and disassembly and examine the functions of 7 different Actin and/or Nucleator Regulators (ANRPs) in guiding these behaviors. We find ANRPs provide distinct activities in building actin cap morphologies – specifically, while DPod1 is a major regulator of actin intensities, Cortactin is required for continued cortical growth, while Coronin functions in both growth and intensity and is required for Cortactin localization to the cap periphery. Unexpectedly, cortical actin populations recover &lt;i&gt;more rapidly&lt;/i&gt; after regulator disruption, suggestive of a deep competition for limited G-actin pools, and we measure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Arp2/3 recruitment efficiencies through an ectopic relocalization strategy. Our results illustrate how the coordination of multiple actin regulators can orchestrate organized and dynamic actin structures in a developmental system.</description>

	<title>eLife: Disruption of entire Cables2 locus leads to embryonic lethality by diminished Rps21 gene expression and enhanced p53 pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50346</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50346</link>
	<description>In vivo function of CDK5 and Abl enzyme substrate 2 (Cables2), belonging to the Cables protein family, is unknown. Here, we found that targeted disruption of the entire &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt; locus (&lt;i&gt;Cables2d&lt;/i&gt;) caused growth retardation and enhanced apoptosis at the gastrulation stage and then induced embryonic lethality in mice. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed disruption of &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt;, 50% down-regulation of &lt;i&gt;Rps21&lt;/i&gt; abutting on the &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt; locus, and up-regulation of p53-target genes in &lt;i&gt;Cables2d&lt;/i&gt; gastrulas. We further revealed the lethality phenotype in &lt;i&gt;Rps21&lt;/i&gt;-deleted mice and unexpectedly, the exon 1-deleted &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt; mice survived. Interestingly, chimeric mice derived from &lt;i&gt;Cables2d&lt;/i&gt; ESCs carrying exogenous &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt; and tetraploid wild-type embryo overcame gastrulation. These results suggest that the diminished expression of &lt;i&gt;Rps21&lt;/i&gt; and the completed lack of &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt; expression are intricately involved in the embryonic lethality via the p53 pathway. This study sheds light on the importance of &lt;i&gt;Cables2&lt;/i&gt; locus in mouse embryonic development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: An optimized protocol for neuronal assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) library preparation using Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<description>Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is rapidly becoming the assay of choice to investigate chromatin-mediated gene regulation, largely because of low input requirements, a fast workflow, and the ability to interrogate the entire genome in an unbiased manner. Many studies using ATAC-seq use mammalian or human-derived tissues and the established protocols work well in these systems. However, ATAC-seq is not yet widely used in Drosophila model systems. Vinegar flies present several key advantages over mammalian systems that make them an excellent model for ATAC-seq studies. For example, there are abundant genetic tools in flies that are not available in mammalian models that allow straightforward targeting, transgene expression, and genetic manipulation. Because current ATAC-seq protocols are not optimized to use fly tissue as input, we developed an optimized workflow that accounts for several complicating factors present in Drosophila. We examined several parameters of library construction, including input size, freezing time, and washing, which specifically address the fly cuticle and possible confounds from retinal pigments. Then, we further optimized the enzymatic steps of library construction to account for the smaller genome size in flies. Finally, we used our optimized protocol to generate ATAC-seq libraries that displayed metrics indicating excellent library quality. Our optimized protocol will enable extensive ATAC-seq experiments in Drosophila, thereby leveraging the advantages of this powerful model system to understand chromatin-mediated gene regulation.</description>

	<description>Marine tunicates produce defensive amino-acid derived metabolites, including 2-(3,5-diiodo-4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-amine (DIMTA), but their mechanisms of action are rarely known. Using an assay-guided approach, we found that out of the many different sensory cells in the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG), DIMTA selectively affected low-threshold cold thermosensors. Whole-cell electrophysiology experiments using DRG cells, channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and human cell lines revealed that DIMTA blocks several potassium channels, reducing the magnitude of the afterhyperpolarization and increasing the baseline [Ca2+]i of low-threshold cold thermosensors. When injected into mice, DIMTA increased the threshold of cold sensation by &amp;gt;3 {degrees}C. DIMTA may thus serve as a lead in the further design of compounds that inhibit problems in the cold-sensory system, such as cold allodynia and other neuropathic pain conditions.</description>

	<description>Optimality analysis of value-based decisions in binary and multi-alternative choice settings predicts that reaction times should be sensitive only to differences in stimulus magnitudes, but not to overall absolute stimulus magnitude. Yet experimental work in the binary case has shown magnitude sensitive reaction times, and theory shows that this can be explained by switching from linear to geometric time costs, but also by nonlinear subjective utility. Thus disentangling explanations for observed magnitude sensitive reaction times is difficult. Here for the first time we extend the theoretical analysis of geometric time-discounting to ternary choices, and present novel experimental evidence for magnitude-sensitivity in such decisions. We consider the optimal policies for all possible combinations of linear and geometric time costs, and linear and nonlinear utility; interestingly, geometric discounting emerges as the predominant explanation for magnitude sensitivity.</description>

	<description>Numerous studies have suggested that the perception of a target sound source can only be segregated from a complex acoustic background if the acoustic features underlying its perceptual attributes (e.g., pitch, location, and timbre) induce temporally modulated responses that are mutually correlated, and that are uncorrelated from those of other sources in the mixture. This &quot;temporal coherence&quot; hypothesis asserts that listening attentively to one or a subset of at tributes of a target source enhances their neural responses and concomitantly enhances all other coherent responses, thus binding them together while simultaneously suppressing the incoherent responses to the background features. Here we report on EEG measurements in human subjects engaged in various sound segregation tasks that demonstrate rapid binding among the temporally coherent features of the attended source regardless of their identity, harmonic relationship, or frequency separation, thus confirming the key role temporal coherence plays in the organization of auditory scenes.</description>

	<description>Memory consolidation requires the encoding of neocortical memory traces, which is thought to occur during hippocampal oscillations called sharp-wave ripples (SWR). Evidence suggests that the hippocampus communicates memory-related neural patterns across distributed cortical circuits via its major output pathways. Here, we sought to understand how this information is processed in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a primary target circuit. Using patch-clamp recordings from mice during quiet wakefulness, we found that SWR-aligned synaptic modulation is widespread but weak, and that spiking responses are sparse. However, using cell type and projection-specific two photon calcium imaging and optogenetics, we show that, starting 1-2 seconds before SWR, superficial inhibition in RSC is reduced, along with thalamocortical input. We propose that pyramidal dendrites experience a period of decreased local inhibition and subcortical interference in a seconds-long time window preceding hippocampal SWR. This may aid communication of weak and sparse SWR-aligned excitation between the hippocampus and neocortex, and promote the selective strengthening of memory-related connections.</description>

	<description>Vitality forms represent a fundamental aspect of social interactions, characterizing how actions are performed and how words are pronounced, on the basis of the agent's attitude. The same action, such as a handshake, has a different impact on the receiver when it is performed kindly or vigorously, and the same happens with a gentle or rude tone of voice. In the present study, we carried out two experiments which aimed to investigate whether and how vocal requests conveying different vitality forms can influence the perception of goal-directed actions and to measure the duration of this effect over time. More specifically, participants listened to an actor voice pronouncing &quot;give me&quot; in a rude or gentle way, and then they were asked to observe the initial part of a rude or gentle passing action, continue it mentally and estimate its conclusion. Results showed that the perception of different vitality forms expressed by vocal requests influenced the estimated action duration. Moreover, we found that this effect was limited to a certain time interval, after which it started to decay.</description>

	<description>When an action potential arrives at a synapse there is a large probability that no neurotransmitter is released. Surprisingly, simple computational models suggest that these synaptic failures enable information processing at lower metabolic costs. However, these models only consider information transmission at single synapses ignoring the remainder of the neural network as well as its overall computational goal. Here, we investigate how synaptic failures affect the energy efficiency of models of entire neural networks that solve a goal-driven task. We find that presynaptic stochasticity and plasticity improve energy efficiency and show that the network allocates most energy to a sparse subset of important synapses. We demonstrate that stabilising these synapses alleviates the stability-plasticity dilemma, thus connecting a presynaptic notion of importance to a computational role in lifelong learning. Overall, our findings present a set of hypotheses for how presynaptic plasticity and stochasticity contribute to sparsity, energy efficiency and improved trade-offs in the stability-plasticity dilemma.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Virtual deep brain stimulation: Multiscale co-simulation of a spiking basal ganglia model and a whole-brain mean-field model with The Virtual Brain</title>

	<description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied in various neurodegenerative diseases as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, its mechanisms of action within the brain network are still poorly understood. Many virtual DBS models analyze a subnetwork around the basal ganglia and its dynamics as a spiking network with their details validated by experimental data. However, connectomic evidence shows widespread effects of DBS affecting many different cortical and subcortical areas. From a clinical perspective, various effects of DBS besides the motoric impact have been demonstrated. The neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB) offers a modeling framework allowing us to virtually perform stimulation, including DBS, and forecast the outcome from a dynamic systems perspective prior to invasive surgery with DBS lead placement. For an accurate prediction of the effects of DBS, we implement a detailed spiking model of the basal ganglia, which we combine with TVB via our previously developed co-simulation environment. This multiscale co-simulation approach builds on the extensive previous literature of spiking models of the basal ganglia while simultaneously offering a whole-brain perspective on widespread effects of the stimulation going beyond the motor circuit. In the first demonstration of our model, we show that virtual DBS can move the firing rates of a Parkinson's disease patient's thalamus - basal ganglia network towards the healthy regime while, at the same time, altering the activity in distributed cortical regions with a pronounced effect in frontal regions. Thus, we provide proof of concept for virtual DBS in a co-simulation environment with TVB. The developed modeling approach has the potential to optimize DBS lead placement and configuration and forecast the success of DBS treatment for individual patients.</description>

	<description>Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle. The canonical description of MU function, established decades ago, rests upon two foundational tenets. First, cortex cannot control MUs independently but supplies each pool with a common drive that specifies force amplitude. Second, as force rises, MUs are recruited in a consistent order typically described by Henneman's size principle. While this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs over a range of behaviors. We developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings during rapidly changing force production. MU responses were surprisingly flexible and behavior-dependent. MU activity could not be accurately described as reflecting common drive, even when fit with highly expressive latent factor models. Neuropixels probe recordings revealed that, consistent with the requirements of fully flexible control, the cortical population response displays a surprisingly large number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, MUs were differentially recruited by microstimulation at neighboring cortical sites. Thus, MU activities are flexibly controlled to meet task demands, and cortex has the capacity to contribute to that ability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Strategic infarct locations for post-stroke depressive symptoms: a lesion- and disconnection-symptom mapping study</title>

	<description>Background: Depression is the most common neuropsychiatric complication after stroke. Infarct location is associated with post-stroke depressive symptoms (PSDS), but it remains debated which brain structures are critically involved. We performed a large-scale lesion-symptom mapping study to identify infarct locations, and white matter disconnections, associated with PSDS. Methods: We included 553 patients (mean age 69, SD 11 years, 42% female) with acute ischemic stroke. PSDS were measured using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Multivariable support vector regression (SVR)-based analyses were performed both at the level of individual voxels (SVR-VLSM) and predefined regions of interest (SVR-ROI) to relate infarct location to PSDS. We externally validated our findings in an independent stroke cohort (N=459). Finally, disconnectome-based analyses were performed using SVR-VLSM, in which white matter fibers disconnected by the infarct were analyzed instead of the infarct itself. Results: Infarcts in the right amygdala, right hippocampus and right pallidum were consistently associated with PSDS (permutation-based p&amp;lt;0.05) in SVR-VLSM and SVR-ROI. External validation (N=459) confirmed the association between infarcts in the right amygdala and pallidum, but not the right hippocampus, and PSDS. Disconnectome-based analyses revealed that disconnections in the right parahippocampal white matter, right thalamus and pallidum, and right anterior thalamic radiation were significantly associated (permutation-based p&amp;lt;0.05) with PSDS. Conclusions: Infarcts in the right amygdala and pallidum, and disconnections of right limbic and frontal cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits, are associated with PSDS. Our findings provide a comprehensive and integrative picture of strategic infarct locations for PSDS, and shed new light on pathophysiological mechanisms of depression after stroke.</description>

	<description>Neural circuit assembly features simultaneous targeting of numerous neuronal processes from constituent neuron types, yet the dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we use the Drosophila olfactory circuit to investigate dynamic cellular processes by which olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) target axons precisely to specific glomeruli in the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobes. Time-lapse imaging of individual axons from 28 ORN types revealed a rich diversity in extension speed, innervation timing, and ipsilateral branch locations, and identified that ipsilateral targeting occurs via stabilization of transient interstitial branches. Fast imaging using adaptive optics corrected lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that upon approaching target, many ORN types exhibit &quot;exploring branches&quot; consisted of parallel microtubule-based terminal branches emanating from an F-actin-rich hub. Antennal nerve ablations uncovered essential roles for bilateral interactions in contralateral target selection, and for ORN axons to facilitate dendritic refinement of postsynaptic partner neurons. Altogether, these observations provide cellular bases for wiring specificity establishment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Young Adults Recruit Similar Motor Modules Across Walking, Turning, and Chair Transfers</title>

	<description>Moving about in the world during daily life requires executing and successfully shifting between a variety of functional tasks, such as arising from a chair or bed, walking, turning, and navigating stairs, etc. Moreover, moving about during daily life requires not only navigating between different functional tasks but also performing these tasks in the presence of mental distractions. However, little is known about underlying neuromuscular control for executing and shifting between these different tasks. In this study, we investigated muscle coordination across walking, turning, and chair transfers by applying motor module (aka muscle synergy) analysis to the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test with and without a secondary cognitive dual task. We found that healthy young adults recruit a small set of common motor modules across the subtasks of the TUG test and that their composition is robust to cognitive distraction. Instead, cognitive distraction impacted motor module activation timings such that they became more consistent. This work is the first to demonstrate motor module generalization across multiple tasks that are both functionally different and crucial for healthy mobility. Overall, our results suggest that the central nervous system may draw from a &quot;library&quot; of modular control strategies to navigate the variety of movements and cognitive demands required of daily life.</description>

	<description>All animals need to differentiate between exafferent stimuli, which are caused by the environment, and reafferent stimuli, which are caused by their own movement. In the case of mechanosensation in aquatic animals, the exafferent inputs are water vibrations in the animal's proximity, which need to be distinguished from the reafferent inputs arising from fluid drag due to locomotion. Both of these inputs are detected by the lateral line, a collection of mechanosensory organs distributed along the surface of the body. In this study, we characterize in detail how the hair cells, which are the receptor cells of the lateral line, discriminate between such reafferent and exafferent signals in zebrafish larvae. Using dye labeling of the lateral line nerve, we visualize two parallel descending inputs that can influence lateral line sensitivity. We combine functional imaging with ultra-structural EM circuit reconstruction to show that cholinergic signals originating from the hindbrain transmit efference copies that cancel out self-generated reafferent stimulation during locomotion, and that dopaminergic signals from the hypothalamus may have a role in threshold modulation both in response to locomotion and salient stimuli. We further gain direct mechanistic insight into the core components of this circuit by loss-of-function perturbations using targeted ablations and gene knockouts. We propose that this simple circuit is the core implementation of mechanosensory reafferent suppression in these young animals and that it might form the first instantiation of state-dependent modulation found at later stages in development.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The hippocampal formation plays established roles in learning, memory, and related cognitive functions. Recent findings also suggest that the hippocampus integrates sensory feedback from self‐generated movements to modulate ongoing motor responses in a changing environment. Such findings support the view of Bland and Oddie (Behavioural Brain Research, 2001, 127, 119–136) that the hippocampus is a site of sensorimotor integration. In further support of this view, we review neurophysiological evidence in developing rats that hippocampal function is built on a sensorimotor foundation and that this foundation is especially evident early in development. Moreover, at those ages when the hippocampus is first establishing functional connectivity with distant sensory and motor structures, that connectivity is preferentially expressed during periods of active (or REM) sleep. These findings reinforce the notion that sleep, as the predominant state of early infancy, provides a critical context for sensorimotor development, including development of the hippocampus and its associated network.</description>

Analyses of gene set differential coexpression may shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypes and diseases. However, differential coexpression analyses of conceptually similar individual studies are often inconsistent and underpowered to provide definitive results. Researchers can greatly benefit from an open-source application facilitating the aggregation of evidence of differential coexpression across studies and the estimation of more robust common effects. We developed Meta Gene Set Coexpression Analysis (MetaGSCA), an analytical tool to systematically assess differential coexpression of an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; defined gene set by aggregating evidence across studies to provide a definitive result. In the kernel, a nonparametric approach that accounts for the gene-gene correlation structure is used to test whether the gene set is differentially coexpressed between two comparative conditions, from which a permutation test &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-statistic is computed for each individual study. A meta-analysis is then performed to combine individual study results with one of two options: a random-intercept logistic regression model or the inverse variance method. We demonstrated MetaGSCA in case studies investigating two human diseases and identified pathways highly relevant to each disease across studies. We further applied MetaGSCA in a pan-cancer analysis with hundreds of major cellular pathways in 11 cancer types. The results indicated that a majority of the pathways identified were dysregulated in the pan-cancer scenario, many of which have been previously reported in the cancer literature. Our analysis with randomly generated gene sets showed excellent specificity, indicating that the significant pathways/gene sets identified by MetaGSCA are unlikely false positives. MetaGSCA is a user-friendly tool implemented in both forms of a Web-based application and an R package “MetaGSCA”. It enables comprehensive meta-analyses of gene set differential coexpression data, with an optional module of &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; pathway crosstalk network analysis to identify and visualize pathways having similar coexpression profiles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u-lEGlXyicI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: How multisite phosphorylation impacts the conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins</title>

Phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can produce changes in structural and dynamical properties and thereby mediate critical biological functions. How phosphorylation effects intrinsically disordered proteins has been studied for an increasing number of IDPs, but a systematic understanding is still lacking. Here, we compare the collapse propensity of four disordered proteins, Ash1, the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase (CTD2’), the cytosolic domain of E-Cadherin, and a fragment of the p130Cas, in unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find all proteins to show V-shape changes in their collapse propensity upon multi-site phosphorylation according to their initial net charge: phosphorylation expands neutral or overall negatively charged IDPs and shrinks positively charged IDPs. However, force fields including those tailored towards and commonly used for IDPs overestimate these changes. We find quantitative agreement of MD results with SAXS and NMR data for Ash1 and CTD2’ only when attenuating protein electrostatic interactions by using a higher salt concentration (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. 350 mM), highlighting the overstabilization of salt bridges in current force fields. We show that phosphorylation of IDPs also has a strong impact on the solvation of the protein, a factor that in addition to the actual collapse or expansion of the IDP should be considered when analyzing SAXS data. Compared to the overall mild change in global IDP dimension, the exposure of active sites can change significantly phosphorylation, underlining the large susceptibility of IDP ensembles to regulation through post-translational modifications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7lGq_FhEXJs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Specialised metabolites from microbial sources are well-known for their wide range of biomedical applications, particularly as antibiotics. When mining paired genomic and metabolomic data sets for novel specialised metabolites, establishing links between Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) and metabolites represents a promising way of finding such novel chemistry. However, due to the lack of detailed biosynthetic knowledge for the majority of predicted BGCs, and the large number of possible combinations, this is not a simple task. This problem is becoming ever more pressing with the increased availability of paired omics data sets. Current tools are not effective at identifying valid links automatically, and manual verification is a considerable bottleneck in natural product research. We demonstrate that using multiple link-scoring functions together makes it easier to prioritise true links relative to others. Based on standardising a commonly used score, we introduce a new, more effective score, and introduce a novel score using an Input-Output Kernel Regression approach. Finally, we present NPLinker, a software framework to link genomic and metabolomic data. Results are verified using publicly available data sets that include validated links.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kgeo4jnNTzw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Does rhythmic neural activity merely echo the rhythmic features of the environment, or does it reflect a fundamental computational mechanism of the brain? This debate has generated a series of clever experimental studies attempting to find an answer. Here, we argue that the field has been obstructed by predictions of oscillators that are based more on intuition rather than biophysical models compatible with the observed phenomena. What follows is a series of cautionary examples that serve as reminders to ground our hypotheses in well-developed theories of oscillatory behavior put forth by theoretical study of dynamical systems. Ultimately, our hope is that this exercise will push the field to concern itself less with the vague question of “oscillation or not” and more with specific biophysical models that can be readily tested.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AU6fNvPQe4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Adipose triglyceride lipase protects renal cell endocytosis in a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; dietary model of chronic kidney disease</title>

Obesity-related renal lipotoxicity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are prevalent pathologies with complex aetiologies. One hallmark of renal lipotoxicity is the ectopic accumulation of lipid droplets in kidney podocytes and in proximal tubule cells. Renal lipid droplets are observed in human CKD patients and in high-fat diet (HFD) rodent models, but their precise role remains unclear. Here, we establish a HFD model in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; that recapitulates renal lipid droplets and several other aspects of mammalian CKD. Cell type–specific genetic manipulations show that lipid can overflow from adipose tissue and is taken up by renal cells called nephrocytes. A HFD drives nephrocyte lipid uptake via the multiligand receptor Cubilin (Cubn), leading to the ectopic accumulation of lipid droplets. These nephrocyte lipid droplets correlate with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial deficits, as well as with impaired macromolecular endocytosis, a key conserved function of renal cells. Nephrocyte knockdown of diglyceride acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), overexpression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and epistasis tests together reveal that fatty acid flux through the lipid droplet triglyceride compartment protects the ER, mitochondria, and endocytosis of renal cells. Strikingly, boosting nephrocyte expression of the lipid droplet resident enzyme ATGL is sufficient to rescue HFD-induced defects in renal endocytosis. Moreover, endocytic rescue requires a conserved mitochondrial regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α). This study demonstrates that lipid droplet lipolysis counteracts the harmful effects of a HFD via a mitochondrial pathway that protects renal endocytosis. It also provides a genetic strategy for determining whether lipid droplets in different biological contexts function primarily to release beneficial or to sequester toxic lipids.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/NsTPWN-exQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented view of cellular diversity of biological systems. However, across the thousands of publications and datasets generated using this technology, we estimate that only a minority (&amp;lt;25%) of studies provide cell-level metadata information containing identified cell types and related findings of the published dataset. Metadata omission hinders reproduction, exploration, validation, and knowledge transfer and is a common problem across journals, data repositories, and publication dates. We encourage investigators, reviewers, journals, and data repositories to improve their standards and ensure proper documentation of these valuable datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YCrBMF-ACq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in the central complex of dicondylian insects</title>

	<description>The central complex is an insect brain area controlling spatial orientation. Immunolabeling in 20 species ranging from firebrats to flies shows that the cellular distribution of the dopamine‐synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the central complex is largely conserved but reveals additional novel cell types in flies and water striders.







Abstract
Dopamine acts as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system and controls a variety of physiological processes. Dopaminergic neurons also innervate the central complex (CX), a multisensory center of the insect brain involved in sky compass navigation, goal‐directed locomotion and sleep control. To infer a possible influence of evolutionary history and lifestyle on the neurochemical architecture of the CX, we have studied the distribution of neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate‐limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Analysis of representatives from 12 insect orders ranging from firebrats to flies revealed high conservation of immunolabeled neurons. One type of TH‐immunoreactive neuron was found in all species studied. The neurons have somata in the pars intercerebralis, arborizations in the lateral accessory lobes, and axonal ramifications in the central body and noduli. In all pterygote species, a second type of tangential neuron of the upper division of the central body was TH‐immunoreactive. The neurons have cell bodies near the calyces and arborizations in the superior protocerebrum. Both types of neuron showed species‐specific variations in cell number and in the innervated areas outside and inside the CX. Additional neurons were found in only two taxa: one type of columnar neuron showed TH immunostaining in the water strider Gerris lacustris, but not in other Heteroptera, and a tritocerebral neuron innervating the protocerebral bridge was immunolabeled in Diptera. The data show largely taxon‐specific variations of a common ground pattern of putatively dopaminergic neurons that may be commonly involved in state‐dependent modulation of CX function.</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26073?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The aim was to demonstrate that continuous s.c. infusion of a soluble levodopa (LD)/carbidopa (CD) phosphate prodrug combination effectively delivers stable LD exposure via a minimally invasive and convenient mode and has the potential to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are not well controlled on oral medication.


Methods
Foslevodopa and foscarbidopa were prepared and the equilibrium solubility and chemical stability examined in aqueous media with different values of pH. Solutions of foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ratios ranging from 4:1 to 20:1) were prepared by dissolving pH‐adjusted lyophilized materials in water and infused s.c. in healthy volunteers for ≤72 hours. Frequent blood samples were collected to measure LD and CD exposure, and safety was monitored throughout the study.


Results
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ABBV‐951) demonstrates high water solubility and excellent chemical stability near physiological pH, enabling continuous s.c. infusion therapy. After s.c. infusion, a stable LD pharmacokinetic (PK) profile was maintained for ≤72 hours, and the infusion was well tolerated.


Interpretation
Preparation of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa enables preclinical and clinical PK, safety, and tolerability studies in support of their advancement for the treatment of PD. In phase 1 clinical trials, foslevodopa/foscarbidopa demonstrates consistent and stable LD plasma exposure, supporting further studies of this treatment as a potentially transformational option for those suffering from PD.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Controlling for activity‐dependent genes and behavioral states is critical for determining brain relationships within and across species</title>

	<description>In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2016, 524, 665–703) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3614–3665) and Chen et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3666–3701) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Episodic memory requires information about objects to be integrated into a spatial framework. Place cells in the hippocampus encode spatial representations of objects that could be generated through signaling from the entorhinal cortex. Projections from lateral (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to the hippocampus terminate in distal and proximal CA1, respectively. We recorded place cells in distal and proximal CA1 as rats explored an environment that contained objects. Place cells in distal CA1 demonstrated higher measures of spatial tuning, stability, and closer proximity of place fields to objects. Furthermore, remapping to object displacement was modulated by place field proximity to objects in distal, but not proximal CA1. Finally, representations of previous object locations were closer to those locations in distal CA1 than proximal CA1. Our data suggest that in cue‐rich environments, LEC inputs to the hippocampus support spatial representations with higher spatial tuning, closer proximity to objects, and greater stability than those receiving inputs from MEC. This is consistent with functional segregation in the entorhinal–hippocampal circuits underlying object‐place memory.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Longitudinal intravital imaging nerve degeneration and sprouting in the toes of spared nerve injured mice</title>

	<description>We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.







Abstract
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within 3 days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within 2 days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7 to 28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.</description>

robotics tasks. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the choice of
feature descriptors (FDs) quantifying the similarity in behaviour of the
solutions. While FDs usually needs to be hand-designed, recent studies have
proposed ways to define them automatically by using feature extraction
techniques, such as PCA or Auto-Encoders, to learn a representation of the
problem from previously explored solutions. Here, we extend these approaches to
more complex problems which cannot be efficiently explored by relying only on a
single representation but require instead a set of diverse and complementary
representations. We describe MC-AURORA, a Quality-Diversity approach that
optimises simultaneously several collections of solutions, each with a
different set of FDs, which are, in turn, defined automatically by an ensemble
of modular auto-encoders. We show that this approach produces solutions that
are more diverse than those produced by single-representation approaches.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current theoretical results on optimization trajectories of neural networks
trained by gradient descent typically have the form of rigorous but potentially
loose bounds on the loss values. In the present work we take a different
approach and show that the learning trajectory can be characterized by an
explicit asymptotic at large training times. Specifically, the leading term in
the asymptotic expansion of the loss behaves as a power law $L(t) \sim
t^{-\xi}$ with exponent $\xi$ expressed only through the data dimension, the
smoothness of the activation function, and the class of function being
approximated. Our results are based on spectral analysis of the integral
operator representing the linearized evolution of a large network trained on
the expected loss. Importantly, the techniques we employ do not require
specific form of a data distribution, for example Gaussian, thus making our
findings sufficiently universal.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain image analysis has advanced substantially in recent years with the
proliferation of neuroimaging datasets acquired at different resolutions. While
research on brain image super-resolution has undergone a rapid development in
the recent years, brain graph super-resolution is still poorly investigated
because of the complex nature of non-Euclidean graph data. In this paper, we
propose the first-ever deep graph super-resolution (GSR) framework that
attempts to automatically generate high-resolution (HR) brain graphs with N'
nodes (i.e., anatomical regions of interest (ROIs)) from low-resolution (LR)
graphs with N nodes where N &amp;lt; N'. First, we formalize our GSR problem as a node
feature embedding learning task. Once the HR nodes' embeddings are learned, the
pairwise connectivity strength between brain ROIs can be derived through an
aggregation rule based on a novel Graph U-Net architecture. While typically the
Graph U-Net is a node-focused architecture where graph embedding depends mainly
on node attributes, we propose a graph-focused architecture where the node
feature embedding is based on the graph topology. Second, inspired by graph
spectral theory, we break the symmetry of the U-Net architecture by
super-resolving the low-resolution brain graph structure and node content with
a GSR layer and two graph convolutional network layers to further learn the
node embeddings in the HR graph. Third, to handle the domain shift between the
ground-truth and the predicted HR brain graphs, we incorporate adversarial
regularization to align their respective distributions. Our proposed AGSR-Net
framework outperformed its variants for predicting high-resolution functional
brain graphs from low-resolution ones. Our AGSR-Net code is available on GitHub
at https://github.com/basiralab/AGSR-Net.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of metaheuristic optimization methods has led to the development
of a large variety of algorithm paradigms. However, no algorithm clearly
dominates all its competitors on all problems. Instead, the underlying variety
of landscapes of optimization problems calls for a variety of algorithms to
solve them efficiently. It is thus of prior importance to have access to mature
and flexible software frameworks which allow for an efficient exploration of
the algorithm design space. Such frameworks should be flexible enough to
accommodate any kind of metaheuristics, and open enough to connect with
higher-level optimization, monitoring and evaluation softwares. This article
summarizes the features of the ParadisEO framework, a comprehensive C++ free
software which targets the development of modular metaheuristics. ParadisEO
provides a highly modular architecture, a large set of components, speed of
execution and automated algorithm design features, which are key to modern
approaches to metaheuristics development.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Estimating the electrical power output of industrial devices with end-to-end time-series classification in the presence of label noise. (arXiv:2105.00349v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00349</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00349</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In complex industrial settings, it is common practice to monitor the
operation of machines in order to detect undesired states, adjust maintenance
schedules, optimize system performance or collect usage statistics of
individual machines. In this work, we focus on estimating the power output of a
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) machine of a medium-sized company facility by
analyzing the total facility power consumption. We formulate the problem as a
time-series classification problem where the class label represents the CHP
power output. As the facility is fully instrumented and sensor measurements
from the CHP are available, we generate the training labels in an automated
fashion from the CHP sensor readings. However, sensor failures result in
mislabeled training data samples which are hard to detect and remove from the
dataset. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-task deep learning approach that
jointly trains a classifier and an autoencoder with a shared embedding
representation. The proposed approach targets to gradually correct the
mislabelled data samples during training in a self-supervised fashion, without
any prior assumption on the amount of label noise. We benchmark our approach on
several time-series classification datasets and find it to be comparable and
sometimes better than state-of-the-art methods. On the real-world use-case of
predicting the CHP power output, we thoroughly evaluate the architectural
design choices and show that the final architecture considerably increases the
robustness of the learning process and consistently beats other recent
state-of-the-art algorithms in the presence of unstructured as well as
structured label noise.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The field of neuromorphic computing is in a period of active exploration.
While many tools have been developed to simulate neuronal dynamics or convert
deep networks to spiking models, general software libraries for learning rules
remain underexplored. This is partly due to the diverse, challenging nature of
efforts to design new learning rules, which range from encoding methods to
gradient approximations, from population approaches that mimic the Bayesian
brain to constrained learning algorithms deployed on memristor crossbars. To
address this gap, we present Neko, a modular, extensible library with a focus
on aiding the design of new learning algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of
Neko in three exemplar cases: online local learning, probabilistic learning,
and analog on-device learning. Our results show that Neko can replicate the
state-of-the-art algorithms and, in one case, lead to significant
outperformance in accuracy and speed. Further, it offers tools including
gradient comparison that can help develop new algorithmic variants. Neko is an
open source Python library that supports PyTorch and TensorFlow backends.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A single layer neural network for the solution of linear equations is
presented. The proposed circuit is based on the standard Hopfield model albeit
with the added flexibility that the interconnection weight matrix need not be
symmetric. This results in an asymmetric Hopfield neural network capable of
solving linear equations. PSPICE simulation results are given which verify the
theoretical predictions. Experimental results for circuits set up to solve
small problems further confirm the operation of the proposed circuit.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nervous system uses oscillations to convey information efficiently. Inter-muscular coherence in the 15–35 Hz range is thought to represent common cortical drive to muscles, but is also in the frequency band in which electrical stimulation is applied to restore movement following neurological disease or injury. We wished to determine if, when stimulation is applied at the peak frequency of the coherence spectra it was still possible to determine voluntary effort. Using healthy human subjects we stimulated muscles in the arms and legs, separate experiments, while recording EMG activity from pairs of muscles including the stimulated muscles. Offline coherence analysis was performed. When stimulation is greater than motor threshold, and applied at the peak of the coherence spectra a new peak appears in the spectra, presumably representing a new frequency of oscillation within the nervous system. This does not appear at lower stimulation levels, or with lower frequencies. The nervous system is capable of switching oscillatory frequencies to account for noise in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders show that most of them can be categorized as synaptopathies—or damage of synaptic function and plasticity. Synaptic formation and maintenance are orchestrated by protein complexes that are in turn regulated in space and time during neuronal development allowing synaptic plasticity. However, the exact mechanisms by which these processes are managed remain unknown. Large-scale genomic and proteomic projects led to the discovery of new molecules and their associated variants as disease risk factors. Neuronal glycoprotein M6a, encoded by the GPM6A gene is emerging as one of these molecules. M6a has been involved in neuron development and synapse formation and plasticity, and was also recently proposed as a gene-target in various neuropsychiatric disorders where it could also be used as a biomarker. In this review, we provide an overview of the structure and molecular mechanisms by which glycoprotein M6a participates in synapse formation and maintenance. We also review evidence collected from patients carrying mutations in the GPM6A gene; animal models, and in vitro studies that together emphasize the relevance of M6a, particularly in synapses and in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To study the dynamic nature of brain activity, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is useful including some temporal dependencies between the corresponding neural activity estimates. Recent studies have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) varies according to time and location which should be incorporated into the model. Modeling this dynamic FC (DFC) requires time-varying measures of spatial region of interest (ROI) sets. To know about the DFC, change-point detection in FC is of particular interest. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting a change-point based on the maximum of eigenvalues via random matrix theory (RMT). From covariance matrices for FC of all ROI's, the temporal change-point of FC is decided by an RMT approach. Simulation results show that our proposed method can detect meaningful FC change-points. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our FC detection approach by applying our method to epilepsy data where change-points detected are explained by the changes in memory capacity. Our study shows the possibility of RMT based approach in DFC change-point problem and in studying the complex dynamic pattern of functional brain interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Examination of BDNF Treatment on BACE1 Activity and Acute Exercise on Brain BDNF Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perturbations in metabolism results in the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides, which is a pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate limiting enzyme responsible for beta-amyloid production. Obesogenic diets increase BACE1 while exercise reduces BACE1 activity, although the mechanisms are unknown. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is an exercise inducible neurotrophic factor, however, it is unknown if BDNF is related to the effects of exercise on BACE1. The purpose of this study was to determine the direct effect of BDNF on BACE1 activity and to examine neuronal pathways induced by exercise. C57BL/6J male mice were assigned to either a low (n = 36) or high fat diet (n = 36) for 10 weeks. To determine the direct effect of BDNF on BACE1, a subset of mice (low fat diet = 12 and high fat diet n = 12) were used for an explant experiment where the brain tissue was directly treated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. To examine neuronal pathways activated with exercise, mice remained sedentary (n = 12) or underwent an acute bout of treadmill running at 15 m/min with a 5% incline for 120 min (n = 12). The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were collected 2-h post-exercise. Direct treatment with BDNF resulted in reductions in BACE1 activity in the prefrontal cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not the hippocampus. The high fat diet reduced BDNF content in the hippocampus; however, the acute bout of exercise increased BDNF in the prefrontal cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.05). These novel findings demonstrate the region specific differences in exercise induced BDNF in lean and obese mice and show that BDNF can reduce BACE1 activity, independent of other exercise-induced alterations. This work demonstrates a previously unknown link between BDNF and BACE1 regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a clinical entity, classified as an atypical Parkinsonism, characterized by both motor and higher cortical dysfunctions. The clinical manifestation of CBS is associated with several pathologies, among which corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is the most common. The aim of our study was to elaborate on the possible vascular pathogenesis of CBS and consider types of vascular lesions in these cases. Several cases of vascular CBS are described in the literature. The majority of presented patients were affected by internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and ischemic strokes; few cases were associated with vascular malformations or autoimmune diseases. Vascular CBS is preceded by an abrupt onset. The clinical manifestation does not significantly differ with non-vascular CBS. Patients with vascular CBS are usually elderly; often with coexistent hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Inferring from our observations, cerebral hypoperfusion can play a significant role in neuropathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. To the best of our knowledge paper is the first comprehensive review of vascular CBS and we are positive that our observations show that further research concerning the vascular pathogenesis of tauopathy atypical Parkinsonism is required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Preeclampsia is emerging as a sex-specific risk factor for cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and dementia, but the reason is unknown. We assessed the relationship of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a marker of placental SVD, with cognition and cerebral SVD in women with and without preeclampsia. We hypothesized women with both preeclampsia and MVM would perform worst on information processing speed and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Women (n = 45; mean 10.5 years post-delivery; mean age: 41 years; 42.2% Black) were classified as preeclampsia-/MVM-, preeclampsia+/MVM-, or preeclampsia+/MVM+. Information processing speed, executive function, and memory were assessed. In a pilot sub-study of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR; n = 22), cerebral blood flow during room-air breathing and breath-hold induced hypercapnia were obtained via arterial spin labeling MRI. Non-parametric tests and regression models were used to test associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Between-group cognitive differences were significant for information processing speed (p = 0.02); preeclampsia+/MVM+ had the lowest scores. Cerebral blood flow increased from room-air to breath-hold, globally and in all regions in the three groups, except the preeclampsia+/MVM+ parietal region (p = 0.12). Lower parietal CVR (less change from room-air breathing to breath-holding) was correlated with poorer information processing speed (partial ρ = 0.63, p = 0.005) and executive function (ρ = 0.50, p = 0.03) independent of preeclampsia/MVM status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Compared to women without preeclampsia and MVM, midlife women with both preeclampsia and MVM have worse information processing speed and may have blunted parietal CVR, an area important for information processing speed and executive function. MVM in women with preeclampsia is a promising sex-specific indicator of cerebrovascular integrity in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Case Report: Barely Able to Speak, Can’t Stop Echoing: Echolalic Dynamic Aphasia in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.635896</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) incorporate two speech-language disturbances (SLDs), non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia and progressive apraxia of speech, but overlook the inclusion of other SLDs, including dynamic aphasia (DA). Thus, there is a need to reappraise the broad spectrum of SLDs in PSP to include other presenting phenotypes. Here we report findings from the study of two elderly patients with PSP presenting with DA and irrepressible echolalia. Both patients had markedly impoverished verbal production, but their performance in other tasks (repetition and naming) and auditory comprehension were preserved or only mildly impaired. Experimental tests of DA revealed impaired word and sentence generation in response to verbal and non-verbal stimuli. Additional language and cognitive testing revealed different types of echolalia (mitigated, automatic, and echoing approval) as well as impaired inhibitory control and social cognition (mentalizing). Both patients had negative neuropsychiatric alterations (i.e., apathy, aspontaneity, and indifference/emotional flatness). Brain magnetic resonance imaging in both patients showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum and superior medial frontal cortex suggestive of PSP, yet further evaluation of the neural correlates using multimodal neuroimaging and neuropathological data was not performed. However, based on the already known neural basis of DA and echolalia in PSP and stroke, we suggest that, in the present cases, neurodegeneration in the midbrain tegmentum, superior medial frontal lobe, and caudate nucleus was responsible for DA and that decreased activity in these regions may play a permissive role for eliciting verbal echoing via disinhibition of the perisylvian speech-language network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Sec17/Sec18 can support membrane fusion without help from completion of SNARE zippering</title>

	<description>Membrane fusion requires R-, Qa-, Qb-, and Qc-family SNAREs that zipper into RQaQbQc coiled coils, driven by the sequestration of apolar amino acids. Zippering has been thought to provide all the force driving fusion. Sec17/aSNAP can form an oligomeric assembly with SNAREs with the Sec17 C-terminus bound to Sec18/NSF, the central region bound to SNAREs, and a crucial apolar loop near the N-terminus poised to insert into membranes. We now report that Sec17 and Sec18 will drive robust fusion without requiring zippering completion. Zippering-driven fusion is blocked by deleting the C-terminal quarter of any Q-SNARE domain or by replacing the apolar amino acids of the Qa-SNARE which face the center of the 4-SNARE coiled coils with polar residues. These blocks, singly or combined, are bypassed by Sec17 and Sec18, and SNARE-dependent fusion is restored without help from completing zippering.</description>

	<description>SARM1 regulates axonal degeneration through its NAD-metabolizing activity and is a drug target for neurodegenerative disorders. We designed and synthesized fluorescent conjugates of styryl derivative with pyridine to serve as substrates of SARM1, which exhibited large red-shifts after conversion. With the conjugates, SARM1 activation was visualized in live cells following elevation of endogenous NMN or treatment with a cell-permeant NMN-analog. In neurons, imaging documented mouse SARM1 activation preceded vincristine-induced axonal degeneration by hours. Library screening identified a derivative of nisoldipine as a covalent inhibitor of SARM1 that reacted with the cysteines, especially Cys311 in its ARM domain and blocked its NMN-activation, protecting axons from degeneration. The Cryo-EM structure showed that SARM1 was locked into an inactive conformation by the inhibitor, uncovering a potential neuroprotective mechanism of dihydropyridines.</description>

	<title>eLife: Metabolic flexibility via mitochondrial BCAA carrier SLC25A44 is required for optimal fever</title>

	<description>Importing necessary metabolites into the mitochondrial matrix is a crucial step of fuel choice during stress adaptation. Branched chain-amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids needed for anabolic processes, but they are also imported into the mitochondria for catabolic reactions. What controls the distinct subcellular BCAA utilization during stress adaptation is insufficiently understood. The present study reports the role of SLC25A44, a recently identified mitochondrial BCAA carrier (MBC), in the regulation of mitochondrial BCAA catabolism and adaptive response to fever in rodents. We found that mitochondrial BCAA oxidation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is significantly enhanced during fever in response to the pyrogenic mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and psychological stress in mice and rats. Genetic deletion of MBC in a BAT-specific manner blunts mitochondrial BCAA oxidation and non-shivering thermogenesis following intracerebroventricular PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; administration. At a cellular level, MBC is required for mitochondrial BCAA deamination as well as the synthesis of mitochondrial amino acids and TCA intermediates. Together, these results illuminate the role of MBC as a determinant of metabolic flexibility to mitochondrial BCAA catabolism and optimal febrile responses. This study also offers an opportunity to control fever by rewiring the subcellular BCAA fate.</description>

	<description>Comparing single-cell transcriptomic atlases from diverse organisms can elucidate the origins of cellular diversity and assist the annotation of new cell atlases. Yet, comparison between distant relatives is hindered by complex gene histories and diversifications in expression programs. Previously, we introduced the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm to robustly reconstruct manifolds from single-cell data (Tarashansky et al., 2019). Here, we build on SAM to map cell atlas manifolds across species. This new method, SAMap, identifies homologous cell types with shared expression programs across distant species within phyla, even in complex examples where homologous tissues emerge from distinct germ layers. SAMap also finds many genes with more similar expression to their paralogs than their orthologs, suggesting paralog substitution may be more common in evolution than previously appreciated. Lastly, comparing species across animal phyla, spanning mouse to sponge, reveals ancient contractile and stem cell families, which may have arisen early in animal evolution.</description>

	<description>Adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocytes alters mitochondrial dynamics, including the mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). However, direct mechanisms linking OPA1 to brown adipose tissue (BAT) physiology are incompletely understood. We utilized a mouse model of selective OPA1 deletion in BAT (OPA1 BAT KO) to investigate the role of OPA1 in thermogenesis. OPA1 is required for cold-induced activation of thermogenic genes in BAT. Unexpectedly, OPA1 deficiency induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a BATokine in an activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-dependent manner. BAT-derived FGF21 mediates an adaptive response, by inducing browning of white adipose tissue, increasing resting metabolic rates, and improving thermoregulation. However, mechanisms independent of FGF21, but dependent on ATF4 induction, promote resistance to diet-induced obesity in OPA1 BAT KO mice. These findings uncover a homeostatic mechanism of BAT-mediated metabolic protection governed in part by an ATF4-FGF21 axis, that is activated independently of BAT thermogenic function.</description>

	<title>eLife: Autism associated SHANK3 missense point mutations impact conformational fluctuations and protein turnover at synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66165</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66165</link>
	<description>Members of the SH3- and ankyrin-rich repeat (SHANK) protein family are considered as master scaffolds of the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. Several missense mutations within the canonical SHANK3 isoform have been proposed as causative for the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, there is a surprising paucity of data linking missense mutation-induced changes in protein structure and dynamics to the occurrence of ASD-related synaptic phenotypes. In this proof-of-principle study, we focus on two ASD-associated point mutations, both located within the same domain of SHANK3 and demonstrate that both mutant proteins indeed show distinct changes in secondary and tertiary structure as well as higher conformational fluctuations. Local and distal structural disturbances result in altered synaptic targeting and changes of protein turnover at synaptic sites in rat primary hippocampal neurons.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66112</link>
	<description>Goal-directed behaviors involve distributed brain networks. The small size of the mouse brain makes it amenable to manipulations of neural activity dispersed across brain areas, but existing optogenetic methods serially test a few brain regions at a time, which slows comprehensive mapping of distributed networks. Laborious operant conditioning training required for most experimental paradigms exacerbates this bottleneck. We present an autonomous workflow to survey the involvement of brain regions at scale during operant behaviors in mice. Naïve mice living in a home-cage system learned voluntary head-fixation (&amp;gt;1 hour/day) and performed difficult decision-making tasks, including contingency reversals, for 2 months without human supervision. We incorporated an optogenetic approach to manipulate activity in deep brain regions through intact skull during home-cage behavior. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we tested dozens of mice in parallel unsupervised optogenetic experiments, revealing multiple regions in cortex, striatum, and superior colliculus involved in tactile decision-making.</description>

	<title>eLife: Multiplexed mRNA assembly into ribonucleoprotein particles plays an operon-like role in the control of yeast cell physiology</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66050</link>
	<description>Prokaryotes utilize polycistronic messages (operons) to co-translate proteins involved in the same biological processes. Whether eukaryotes achieve similar regulation by selectively assembling and translating monocistronic messages derived from different chromosomes is unknown. We employed transcript-specific RNA pulldowns and RNA-seq/RT-PCR to identify yeast mRNAs that co-precipitate as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Consistent with the hypothesis of eukaryotic RNA operons, mRNAs encoding components of the mating pathway, heat shock proteins, and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins multiplex &lt;i&gt;in trans&lt;/i&gt;, forming discrete mRNP complexes (called &lt;i&gt;transperons&lt;/i&gt;). Chromatin-capture and allele tagging experiments reveal that genes encoding multiplexed mRNAs physically interact, thus, RNA assembly may result from co-regulated gene expression. Transperon assembly and function depends upon histone H4 and depletion leads to defects in RNA multiplexing, decreased pheromone responsiveness and mating, and increased heat shock sensitivity. We propose that intergenic associations and non-canonical histone H4 functions contribute to transperon formation in eukaryotic cells and regulate cell physiology.</description>

	<title>eLife: Linguistic processing of task-irrelevant speech at a Cocktail Party</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65096</link>
	<description>Paying attention to one speaker in noisy environments can be extremely difficult, because to-be-attended and task-irrelevant speech compete for processing resources. We tested whether this competition is restricted to acoustic-phonetic interference or if it extends to competition for linguistic processing as well. Neural activity was recorded using Magnetoencephalography as human participants were instructed to attended to natural speech presented to one ear, and task-irrelevant stimuli were presented to the other. Task-irrelevant stimuli consisted either of random sequences of syllables, or syllables structured to form coherent sentences, using hierarchical frequency-tagging. We find that the phrasal structure of structured task-irrelevant stimuli was represented in the neural response in left inferior frontal and posterior parietal regions, indicating that selective attention does not fully eliminate linguistic processing of task-irrelevant speech. Additionally, neural tracking of to-be-attended speech in left inferior frontal regions was enhanced when competing with structured task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting inherent competition between them for linguistic processing.</description>

	<title>eLife: Multiple lineages of Streptomyces produce antimicrobials within passalid beetle galleries across eastern North America</title>

	<description>Some insects form symbioses in which actinomycetes provide defense against pathogens by making antimicrobials. The range of chemical strategies employed across these associations, and how these strategies relate to insect lifestyle, remains underexplored. We assessed subsocial passalid beetles of the species &lt;i&gt;Odontotaenius disjunctus&lt;/i&gt;, and their frass (fecal material), which is an important food resource within their galleries, as a model insect/actinomycete system. Through chemical and phylogenetic analyses, we found that &lt;i&gt;O. disjunctus&lt;/i&gt; frass collected across eastern North America harbored multiple lineages of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; and diverse antimicrobials. Metabolites detected in frass displayed synergistic and antagonistic inhibition of a fungal entomopathogen, &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium anisopliae&lt;/i&gt;, and multiple streptomycete isolates inhibited this pathogen when co-cultivated directly in frass. These findings support a model in which the lifestyle of &lt;i&gt;O. disjunctus&lt;/i&gt; accommodates multiple &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; lineages in their frass, resulting in a rich repertoire of antimicrobials that likely insulates their galleries against pathogenic invasion.</description>

	<description>Culture-independent analyses of microbial communities have progressed dramatically in the last decade, particularly due to advances in methods for biological profiling via shotgun metagenomics. Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate, with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcus bromii&lt;/i&gt;, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes. With open-source implementations and cloud-deployable reproducible workflows, the bioBakery 3 platform can help researchers deepen the resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial community studies.</description>

	<title>eLife: Receptor-mediated mitophagy regulates EPO production and protects against renal anemia</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64480</link>
	<description>Erythropoietin (EPO) drives erythropoiesis and is secreted mainly by the kidney upon hypoxic or anemic stress. The paucity of EPO production in renal EPO-producing cells (REPs) causes renal anemia, one of the most common complications of chronic nephropathies. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is commonly observed in several renal and hematopoietic disorders, the mechanism by which mitochondrial quality control impacts renal anemia remains elusive. In this study, we showed that FUNDC1, a mitophagy receptor, plays a critical role in EPO-driven erythropoiesis induced by stresses. Mechanistically, EPO production is impaired in REPs in &lt;i&gt;Fundc1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mice upon stresses, and the impairment is caused by the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which consequently leads to the elevation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and triggers inflammatory responses by up-regulating proinflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory factors promote the myofibroblastic transformation of REPs, resulting in the reduction of EPO production. We therefore provide a link between aberrant mitophagy and deficient EPO generation in renal anemia. Our results also suggest that the mitochondrial quality control safeguards REPs under stresses, which may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of renal anemia.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64213</link>
	<description>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed fibrosis in embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) patients comparable to levels seen in atrial fibrillation (AFib). We used computational modeling to understand the absence of arrhythmia in ESUS despite the presence of putatively pro-arrhythmic fibrosis. MRI-based atrial models were reconstructed for 45 ESUS and 45 AFib patients. The fibrotic substrate's arrhythmogenic capacity in each patient was assessed computationally. Reentrant drivers were induced in 24/45 (53%) ESUS and 22/45 (49%) AFib models. Inducible models had more fibrosis (16.7±5.45%) than non-inducible models (11.07±3.61%; P&amp;lt;0.0001); however, inducible subsets of ESUS and AFib models had similar fibrosis levels (P=0.90), meaning the &lt;i&gt;intrinsic pro-arrhythmic substrate properties&lt;/i&gt; of fibrosis in ESUS and AFib are indistinguishable. This suggests some ESUS patients have latent pre-clinical fibrotic substrate that could be a future source of arrhythmogenicity. Thus, our work prompts the hypothesis that ESUS patients with fibrotic atria are spared from AFib due to an absence of arrhythmia triggers.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63976</link>
	<description>Intact-organism imaging of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae reveals and quantifies chromatin-aqueous phase separation. The chromatin can be organized near the lamina layer of the nuclear envelope, conventionally fill the nucleus, be organized centrally, or as a wetting droplet. These transitions are controlled by changes in nuclear volume and the interaction of chromatin with the lamina (part of the nuclear envelope) at the nuclear periphery. Using a simple polymeric model that includes the key features of chromatin self-attraction and its binding to the lamina, we demonstrate theoretically that it is the competition of these two effects that determines the mode of chromatin distribution. The qualitative trends as well as the composition profiles obtained in our simulations compare well with the observed intact-organism imaging and quantification. Since the simulations contain only a small number of physical variables we can identify the generic mechanisms underlying the changes in the observed phase separations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Co-targeting myelin inhibitors and CSPGs markedly enhances regeneration of GDNF-stimulated, but not conditioning-lesioned, sensory axons into the spinal cord</title>

	<description>A major barrier to intraspinal regeneration after dorsal root (DR) injury is the DR entry zone (DREZ), the CNS/PNS interface. DR axons stop regenerating at the DREZ, even if regenerative capacity is increased by a nerve conditioning lesion. This potent blockade has long been attributed to myelin-associated inhibitors and CSPGs, but incomplete lesions and conflicting reports have prevented conclusive agreement. Here we evaluated DR regeneration in mice, using novel strategies to facilitate complete lesions and analyses, selective tracing of proprioceptive and mechanoreceptive axons, and the first simultaneous targeting of Nogo/Reticulon-4, MAG, OMgp, CSPGs and GDNF. Co-eliminating myelin inhibitors and CSPGs elicited regeneration of only a few conditioning-lesioned DR axons across the DREZ. Their absence, however, markedly and synergistically enhanced regeneration of GDNF-stimulated axons, highlighting the importance of sufficiently elevating intrinsic growth capacity. We also conclude that myelin inhibitors and CSPGs are not the primary mechanism stopping axons at the DREZ.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling historic incidence trends implies early field cancerization in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</title>

Patterns of cancer incidence, viewed over extended time periods, reveal important aspects of multistage carcinogenesis. Here we show how a multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) model for cancer can be harnessed to identify biological processes that shape the surprisingly dynamic and disparate incidence patterns of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the US population. While the dramatic rise in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the US has been largely attributed to reflux related increases in the prevalence of Barrett’s esophagus (BE), the premalignant field in which most EAC are thought to arise, only scant evidence exists for field cancerization contributing to ESCC. Our analyses of incidence patterns suggest that ESCC is associated with a premalignant field that may develop very early in life. Although the risk of ESCC, which is substantially higher in Blacks than Whites, is generally assumed to be associated with late-childhood and adult exposures to carcinogens, such as from tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and various industrial exposures, the temporal trends we identify for ESCC suggest an onset distribution of field-defects before age 10, most strongly among Blacks. These trends differ significantly in shape and strength from field-defect trends that we estimate for US Whites. Moreover, the rates of ESCC-predisposing field-defects predicted by the model for cohorts of black children are decreasing for more recent birth cohorts (for Blacks born after 1940). These results point to a potential etiologic role of factors acting early in life, perhaps related to nutritional deficiencies, in the development of ESCC and its predisposing field-defect. Such factors may explain some of the striking racial differences seen in ESCC incidence patterns over time in the US.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1yCAqdjtwYU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A wide variety of 1) parametric regression models and 2) co-expression networks have been developed for finding gene-by-gene interactions underlying complex traits from expression data. While both methodological schemes have their own well-known benefits, little is known about their synergistic potential. Our study introduces their methodological fusion that cross-exploits the strengths of individual approaches via a built-in information-sharing mechanism. This fusion is theoretically based on certain trait-conditioned dependency patterns between two genes depending on their role in the underlying parametric model. Resulting trait-specific co-expression network estimation method 1) serves to enhance the interpretation of biological networks in a parametric sense, and 2) exploits the underlying parametric model itself in the estimation process. To also account for the substantial amount of intrinsic noise and collinearities, often entailed by expression data, a tailored co-expression measure is introduced along with this framework to alleviate related computational problems. A remarkable advance over the reference methods in simulated scenarios substantiate the method’s high-efficiency. As proof-of-concept, this synergistic approach is successfully applied in survival analysis, with acute myeloid leukemia data, further highlighting the framework’s versatility and broad practical relevance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8PyA9qV1dkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Motivation &lt;p&gt;Protein structure prediction has been greatly improved by deep learning, but most efforts are devoted to template-free modeling. But very few deep learning methods are developed for TBM (template-based modeling), a popular technique for protein structure prediction. TBM has been studied extensively in the past, but its accuracy is not satisfactory when highly similar templates are not available.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new method NDThreader (New Deep-learning Threader) to address the challenges of TBM. NDThreader first employs DRNF (deep convolutional residual neural fields), which is an integration of deep ResNet (convolutional residue neural networks) and CRF (conditional random fields), to align a query protein to templates without using any distance information. Then NDThreader uses ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) and DRNF to further improve sequence-template alignments by making use of predicted distance potential. Finally, NDThreader builds 3D models from a sequence-template alignment by feeding it and sequence coevolution information into a deep ResNet to predict inter-atom distance distribution, which is then fed into PyRosetta for 3D model construction. Our experimental results show that NDThreader greatly outperforms existing methods such as CNFpred, HHpred, DeepThreader and CEthreader. NDThreader was blindly tested in CASP14 as a part of RaptorX server, which obtained the best average GDT score among all CASP14 servers on the 58 TBM targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7uRTn7xk6HI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Small subpopulations of β-cells do not drive islet oscillatory [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics via gap junction communication</title>

The islets of Langerhans exist as multicellular networks that regulate blood glucose levels. The majority of cells in the islet are excitable, insulin-producing β-cells that are electrically coupled via gap junction channels. β-cells are known to display heterogeneous functionality. However, due to gap junction coupling, β-cells show coordinated [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillations when stimulated with glucose, and global quiescence when unstimulated. Small subpopulations of highly functional β-cells have been suggested to control [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics across the islet. When these populations were targeted by optogenetic silencing or photoablation, [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics across the islet were largely disrupted. In this study, we investigated the theoretical basis of these experiments and how small populations can disproportionality control islet [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics. Using a multicellular islet model, we generated normal, skewed or bimodal distributions of β-cell heterogeneity. We examined how islet [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics were disrupted when cells were targeted via hyperpolarization or populations were removed; to mimic optogenetic silencing or photoablation, respectively. Targeted cell populations were chosen based on characteristics linked to functional subpopulation, including metabolic rate of glucose oxidation or [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillation frequency. Islets were susceptible to marked suppression of [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] when ~10% of cells with high metabolic activity were hyperpolarized; where hyperpolarizing cells with normal metabolic activity had little effect. However, when highly metabolic cells were removed from the model, [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillations remained. Similarly, when ~10% of cells with either the highest frequency or earliest elevations in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] were removed from the islet, the [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillation frequency remained largely unchanged. Overall, these results indicate small populations of β-cells with either increased metabolic activity or increased frequency are unable to disproportionately control islet-wide [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] via gap junction coupling. Therefore, we need to reconsider the physiological basis for such small β-cell populations or the mechanism by which they may be acting to control normal islet function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/emRrVcUZvHQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cognitive brain imaging is accumulating datasets about the neural substrate of many different mental processes. Yet, most studies are based on few subjects and have low statistical power. Analyzing data across studies could bring more statistical power; yet the current brain-imaging analytic framework cannot be used at scale as it requires casting all cognitive tasks in a unified theoretical framework. We introduce a new methodology to analyze brain responses across tasks without a joint model of the psychological processes. The method boosts statistical power in small studies with specific cognitive focus by analyzing them jointly with large studies that probe less focal mental processes. Our approach improves decoding performance for 80% of 35 widely-different functional-imaging studies. It finds commonalities across tasks in a data-driven way, via common brain representations that predict mental processes. These are brain networks tuned to psychological manipulations. They outline interpretable and plausible brain structures. The extracted networks have been made available; they can be readily reused in new neuro-imaging studies. We provide a multi-study decoding tool to adapt to new data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g4xGhNzQqwM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Numerical analysis of the impact of cytoskeletal actin filament density alterations onto the diffusive vesicle-mediated cell transport</title>

The interior of a eukaryotic cell is a highly complex composite material which consists of water, structural scaffoldings, organelles, and various biomolecular solutes. All these components serve as obstacles that impede the motion of vesicles. Hence, it is hypothesized that any alteration of the cytoskeletal network may directly impact or even disrupt the vesicle transport. A disruption of the vesicle-mediate cell transport is thought to contribute to several severe diseases and disorders, such as diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, emphasizing the clinical relevance. To address the outlined objective, a multiscale finite element model of the diffusive vesicle transport is proposed on the basis of the concept of homogenization, owed to the complexity of the cytoskeletal network. In order to study the microscopic effects of specific nanoscopic actin filament network alterations onto the vesicle transport, a parametrized three-dimensional geometrical model of the actin filament network was generated on the basis of experimentally observed filament densities and network geometries in an adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell. Numerical analyzes of the obtained effective diffusion properties within two-dimensional sampling domains of the whole cell model revealed that the computed homogenized diffusion coefficients can be predicted statistically accurate by a simple two-parameter power law as soon as the inaccessible area fraction, due to the obstacle geometries and the finite size of the vesicles, is known. This relationship, in turn, leads to a massive reduction in computation time and allows to study the impact of a variety of different cytoskeletal alterations onto the vesicle transport. Hence, the numerical simulations predicted a 35% increase in transport time due to a uniformly distributed four-fold increase of the total filament amount. On the other hand, a hypothetically reduced expression of filament cross-linking proteins led to sparser filament networks and, thus, a speed up of the vesicle transport.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GwtP18KnWcw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) can be used to infer a temporal ordering of cellular states. Current methods for the inference of cellular trajectories rely on unbiased dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such biologically agnostic ordering can prove difficult for modeling complex developmental or differentiation processes. The cellular heterogeneity of dynamic biological compartments can result in sparse sampling of key intermediate cell states. To overcome these limitations, we develop a supervised machine learning framework, called Pseudocell Tracer, which infers trajectories in pseudospace rather than in pseudotime. The method uses a supervised encoder, trained with adjacent biological information, to project scRNAseq data into a low-dimensional manifold that maps the transcriptional states a cell can occupy. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to simulate pesudocells at regular intervals along a virtual cell-state axis. We demonstrate the utility of Pseudocell Tracer by modeling B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) during a prototypic antigen-induced antibody response. Our results revealed an ordering of key transcription factors regulating CSR to the IgG1 isotype, including the concomitant expression of &lt;i&gt;Nfkb1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stat6&lt;/i&gt; prior to the upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Bach2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of genes encoding cytokine receptors suggest a poised IL-4 signaling state that preceeds CSR to the IgG1 isotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7gDjRWKf9w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genomic research led the way in open science, a tradition continued by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)—through the sharing of materials, results, and data. Coordinated quality control procedures also contributed to robust findings. However, recent years have seen declines in GWAS transparency. Here, we assess some shifts away from open science practices with the aim of stimulating a discussion of these issues.

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dynamic patterns of correlated activity in the prefrontal cortex encode information about social behavior</title>

New technologies make it possible to measure activity from many neurons simultaneously. One approach is to analyze simultaneously recorded neurons individually, then group together neurons which increase their activity during similar behaviors into an “ensemble.” However, this notion of an ensemble ignores the ability of neurons to act collectively and encode and transmit information in ways that are not reflected by their individual activity levels. We used microendoscopic GCaMP imaging to measure prefrontal activity while mice were either alone or engaged in social interaction. We developed an approach that combines a neural network classifier and surrogate (shuffled) datasets to characterize how neurons synergistically transmit information about social behavior. Notably, unlike optimal linear classifiers, a neural network classifier with a single linear hidden layer can discriminate network states which differ solely in patterns of coactivity, and not in the activity levels of individual neurons. Using this approach, we found that surrogate datasets which preserve behaviorally specific patterns of coactivity (correlations) outperform those which preserve behaviorally driven changes in activity levels but not correlated activity. Thus, social behavior elicits increases in correlated activity that are not explained simply by the activity levels of the underlying neurons, and prefrontal neurons act collectively to transmit information about socialization via these correlations. Notably, this ability of correlated activity to enhance the information transmitted by neuronal ensembles is diminished in mice lacking the autism-associated gene &lt;i&gt;Shank3&lt;/i&gt;. These results show that synergy is an important concept for the coding of social behavior which can be disrupted in disease states, reveal a specific mechanism underlying this synergy (social behavior increases correlated activity within specific ensembles), and outline methods for studying how neurons within an ensemble can work together to encode information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CwNTYJ59YnQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Premature termination codons (PTC) cause over 10% of genetic disease cases. Some aminoglycosides that bind to the ribosome decoding center can induce PTC readthrough and restore low levels of full-length functional proteins. However, concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis limits the extent of PTC readthrough that can be achieved by aminoglycosides like G418. Using a cell-based screen, we identified a small molecule, the phenylpyrazoleanilide Y-320, that potently enhances &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt;, and C&lt;i&gt;OL17A1&lt;/i&gt; PTC readthrough by G418. Unexpectedly, Y-320 increased cellular protein levels and protein synthesis, measured by SYPRO Ruby protein staining and puromycin labeling, as well as ribosome biogenesis measured using antibodies to rRNA and ribosomal protein S6. Y-320 did not increase the rate of translation elongation and it exerted its effects independently of mTOR signaling. At the single cell level, exposure to Y-320 and G418 increased ribosome content and protein synthesis which correlated strongly with PTC readthrough. As a single agent, Y-320 did not affect translation fidelity measured using a luciferase reporter gene but it enhanced misincorporation by G418. RNA-seq data showed that Y-320 up-regulated the expression of CXC chemokines CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL11, CXCL3, CXCL1, and CXCL16. Several of these chemokines exert their cellular effects through the receptor CXCR2 and the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 reduced cellular protein levels and PTC readthrough in cells exposed to Y-320 and G418. These data show that the self-limiting nature of PTC readthrough by G418 can be compensated by Y-320, a potent enhancer of PTC readthrough that increases ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. They also support a model whereby increased PTC readthrough is enabled by increased protein synthesis mediated by an autocrine chemokine signaling pathway. The findings also raise the possibility that inflammatory processes affect cellular propensity to readthrough agents and that immunomodulatory drugs like Y-320 might find application in PTC readthrough therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gUGm93WnZCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Preservation of brain activity in unresponsive patients identifies MCS star</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26095</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26095?af=R</link>
	<description>Objectives
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (i.e., vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by 3 experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (i.e., MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genome‐wide association studies of LRRK2 modifiers of Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26094</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26094?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genome‐wide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genome‐wide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; P‐value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genome‐wide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these two proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: P‐value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: P‐value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Association of Disinhibited Eating and Trait of Impulsivity With Insula and Amygdala Responses to Palatable Liquid Consumption</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.647143</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.647143</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eating behavior is not only influenced by the current energy balance, but also by the behavioral characteristics of eating. One of the recognized eating behavior constructs is ‘disinhibited eating,’ which refers to the tendency to overeat in response to negative emotional states or the presence of highly palatable foods. Food-related disinhibition is involved in binge eating, weight gain, and obesity and is also associated with the trait of impulsivity, which in turn, is linked to weight gain or maladaptive eating. However, the relationships among food-related disinhibition, the trait of impulsivity, and the neural substrates of eating behaviors in adolescence remain unclear. Therefore, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to examine the associations between brain responses to palatable liquid consumption and disinhibited eating behavior or impulsivity in healthy adolescents. Thirty-four adolescents (mean age ± standard deviation = 17.12 ± 1.91 years, age range = 14–19 years, boys = 15, girls = 19) participated in this study. Disinhibited eating was assessed with the disinhibition subscale of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, while impulsivity was assessed using the Barratt impulsiveness scale. Participants received two fMRI sessions−a palatable liquid consumption fMRI and a resting-state fMRI. The fMRI experiment showed that increased disinhibited eating was positively associated with a greater insular response to palatable liquid consumption, while increased impulsivity was positively correlated with a greater amygdala response. The resting-state fMRI experiment showed that increased disinhibited eating was positively correlated with strengthened intrinsic functional connectivity between the insula and the amygdala, adjusting for sex (estimates of the beta coefficients = 0.146, standard error = 0.068, p = 0.040). Given that the amygdala and insular cortex are structurally and functionally connected and involved in trait impulsivity and ingestive behavior, our findings suggest that increased disinhibited eating would be associated with impulsivity via strengthened intrinsic functional connectivity between the insula and amygdala and linked to maladaptive eating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Mechanisms of Reward-by-Cueing Interactions: ERP Evidence</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.608427</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the phenomenon that a person is slower to respond to targets at a previously cued location. The present study aimed to explore whether target-reward association is subject to IOR, using event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the underlying neural mechanism. Each participant performed a localization task and a color discrimination task in an exogenous cueing paradigm, with the targets presented in colors (green/red) previously associated with high- or low-reward probability. The results of both tasks revealed that the N1, Nd, and P3 components exhibited differential amplitudes between cued and uncued trials (i.e., IOR) under low reward, with the N1 and Nd amplitudes being enhanced for uncued trials compared to cued trials, and the P3 amplitude being enhanced for cued trials vs. uncued trials. Under high reward, however, no difference was found between the amplitudes on cued and uncued trials for any of the components. These findings demonstrate that targets that were previously associated with high reward can be resistant to IOR and the current results enrich the evidence for interactions between reward-association and attentional orientation in the cueing paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Collective Dynamics of Neural Networks With Sleep-Related Biological Drives in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.616193</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.616193</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The collective electrophysiological dynamics of the brain as a result of sleep-related biological drives in Drosophila are investigated in this paper. Based on the Huber-Braun thermoreceptor model, the conductance-based neurons model is extended to a coupled neural network to analyze the local field potential (LFP). The LFP is calculated by using two different metrics: the mean value and the distance-dependent LFP. The distribution of neurons around the electrodes is assumed to have a circular or grid distribution on a two-dimensional plane. Regardless of which method is used, qualitatively similar results are obtained that are roughly consistent with the experimental data. During wake, the LFP has an irregular or a regular spike. However, the LFP becomes regular bursting during sleep. To further analyze the results, wavelet analysis and raster plots are used to examine how the LFP frequencies changed. The synchronization of neurons under different network structures is also studied. The results demonstrate that there are obvious oscillations at approximately 8 Hz during sleep that are absent during wake. Different time series of the LFP can be obtained under different network structures and the density of the network will also affect the magnitude of the potential. As the number of coupled neurons increases, the neural network becomes easier to synchronize, but the sleep and wake time described by the LFP spectrogram do not change. Moreover, the parameters that affect the durations of sleep and wake are analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain Predict Phenoconversion of Pure Autonomic Failure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26089</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26089?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n = 32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. Five patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but two cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in five samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

Cortical networks show a large heterogeneity of neuronal properties. However, traditional coding models have focused on homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here, we analytically derive a class of recurrent networks of spiking neurons that close to optimally track a continuously varying input online, based on two assumptions: 1) every spike is decoded linearly and 2) the network aims to reduce the mean-squared error between the input and the estimate. From this we derive a class of predictive coding networks, that unifies encoding and decoding and in which we can investigate the difference between homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks, in which each neurons represents different features and has different spike-generating properties. We find that in this framework, ‘type 1’ and ‘type 2’ neurons arise naturally and networks consisting of a heterogeneous population of different neuron types are both more efficient and more robust against correlated noise. We make two experimental predictions: 1) we predict that integrators show strong correlations with other integrators and resonators are correlated with resonators, whereas the correlations are much weaker between neurons with different coding properties and 2) that ‘type 2’ neurons are more coherent with the overall network activity than ‘type 1’ neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6BuYyKmf5kI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; species, the causative agent of malaria, have a complex life cycle involving two hosts. The sporozoite life stage is characterized by an extended phase in the mosquito salivary glands followed by free movement and rapid invasion of hepatocytes in the human host. This transmission stage has been the subject of many transcriptomics and proteomics studies and is also targeted by the most advanced malaria vaccine. We applied Bayesian data integration to determine which proteins are not only present in sporozoites but are also specific to that stage. Transcriptomic and proteomic &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; data sets from 26 studies were weighted for how representative they are for sporozoites, based on a carefully assembled gold standard for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)&lt;/i&gt; proteins known to be present or absent during the sporozoite life stage. Of 5418 &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt; genes for which expression data were available at the RNA level or at the protein level, 975 were identified as enriched in sporozoites and 90 specific to them. We show that &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt; sporozoites are enriched for proteins involved in type II fatty acid synthesis in the apicoplast and GPI anchor synthesis, but otherwise appear metabolically relatively inactive in the salivary glands of mosquitos. Newly annotated hypothetical sporozoite-specific and sporozoite-enriched proteins highlight sporozoite-specific functions. They include PF3D7_0104100 that we identified to be homologous to the prominin family, which in human has been related to a quiescent state of cancer cells. We document high levels of genetic variability for sporozoite proteins, specifically for sporozoite-specific proteins that elicit antibodies in the human host. Nevertheless, we can identify nine relatively well-conserved sporozoite proteins that elicit antibodies and that together can serve as markers for previous exposure. Our understanding of sporozoite biology benefits from identifying key pathways that are enriched during this life stage. This work can guide studies of molecular mechanisms underlying sporozoite biology and potential well-conserved targets for marker and drug development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oSUJkj0SPjI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut Microbiome in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26084</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26084?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls and relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), quality of life, and brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients and controls but did not differ between RRMS and progressive MS or differ based on disease‐modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by body mass index, race, and sex. In both progressive MS and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCMM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17–producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
Whereas some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality and comparability, hence the understanding of the spectrum, burden, and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the World Health Organization, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonized clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and neurological complications, with standardized forms for pooled data analyses that nonspecialists can use, including those in low‐income settings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Streams of action potentials or long depolarizations evoke a massive exocytosis of transmitters and peptides from the surface of dendrites, axons and cell bodies of different neuron types. Such mode of exocytosis is known as extrasynaptic for occurring without utilization of synaptic structures. Most transmitters and all peptides can be released extrasynaptically. Neurons may discharge their contents with relative independence from the axon, soma and dendrites. Extrasynaptic exocytosis takes fractions of a second in varicosities or minutes in the soma or dendrites, but its effects last from seconds to hours. Unlike synaptic exocytosis, which is well localized, extrasynaptic exocytosis is diffuse and affects neuronal circuits, glia and blood vessels. Molecules that are liberated may reach extrasynaptic receptors microns away. The coupling between excitation and exocytosis follows a multistep mechanism, different from that at synapses, but similar to that for the release of hormones. The steps from excitation to exocytosis have been studied step by step for the vital transmitter serotonin in leech Retzius neurons. The events leading to serotonin exocytosis occur similarly for the release of other transmitters and peptides in central and peripheral neurons. Extrasynaptic exocytosis occurs commonly onto glial cells, which react by releasing the same or other transmitters. In the last section, we discuss how illumination of the retina evokes extrasynaptic release of dopamine and ATP. Dopamine contributes to light-adaptation; ATP activates glia, which mediates an increase in blood flow and oxygenation. A proper understanding of the workings of the nervous system requires the understanding of extrasynaptic communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MicroRNA Dysregulation in Parkinson’s Disease: A Narrative Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disease, affecting the motor system, leading to resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, walking and gait difficulties, and postural instability. The severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta causes striatal dopamine deficiency and the presence of Lewy bodies indicates a pathological hallmark of PD. Although the current treatment of PD aims to preserve dopaminergic neurons or to replace dopamine depletion in the brain, it is notable that complete recovery from the disease is yet to be achieved. Given the complexity and multisystem effects of PD, the underlying mechanisms of PD pathogenesis are yet to be elucidated. The advancement of medical technologies has given some insights in understanding the mechanism and potential treatment of PD with a special interest in the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) to unravel the pathophysiology of PD. In PD patients, it was found that striatal brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra demonstrated dysregulated miRNAs expression profiles. Hence, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD through modulation of PD-associated gene and protein expression. This review will discuss recent findings on PD-associated miRNAs dysregulation, from the regulation of PD-associated genes, dopaminergic neuron survival, α-synuclein-induced inflammation and circulating miRNAs. The next section of this review also provides an update on the potential uses of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic tools for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To explore the effect of combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and conventional rehabilitation on the recovery of consciousness in patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 48 patients in a PVS were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with rTMS to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and patients in the control group were treated with false stimulation. All patients were evaluated using scales and neuroelectrophysiological assessment before treatment, after 30 days of treatment, and following 60 days of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Based on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and electroencephalogram (EEG) grading indexes, the treatment group was significantly higher than those of the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. The average difference in the three measurements between the two groups before treatment, at 30 days, and 60 days was 0.04, 1.54, and 2.09 for CRS-R and 0.08, −0.83, and −0.62 for EEG indexes, respectively. The latency periods of each wave of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in the treatment group were shorter than those in the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. In both groups, the BAEP scores after 30 days of treatment were significantly higher than the scores before treatment, and the scores after 60 days of treatment were higher than the scores after 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In patients in a PVS, rTMS assists in the recovery of consciousness function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies on Parkinson disease (PD) have mostly focused on the central nervous system—specifically, on the loss of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and associated motor dysfunction. However, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is gaining prominence in PD research, with increasing clinical attention being paid to non-motor symptoms. Researchers found abnormal deposition of α-synuclein and neuroinflammation in the PNS. Attempts have been made to use these pathological changes during the clinical diagnosis of PD. Animal studies demonstrated that combined transplantation of autologous peripheral nerves and cells with tyrosine hydroxylase activity can reduce dopaminergic neuronal damage, and similar effects were observed in some clinical trials. In this review, we will systematically explain PNS performance in PD pathology and its clinical diagnostic research, describe PNS experimental results [especially Schwann cell (SC) transplantation in the treatment of PD animal models] and the results of clinical trials, and discuss future directions. The mechanism by which SCs produce such a therapeutic effect and the safety of transplantation therapy are briefly described.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Vector Phase Analysis Approach for Sleep Stage Classification: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Based Passive Brain–Computer Interface</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A passive brain–computer interface (BCI) based upon functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain signals is used for earlier detection of human drowsiness during driving tasks. This BCI modality acquired hemodynamic signals of 13 healthy subjects from the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPFC) of the brain. Drowsiness activity is recorded using a continuous-wave fNIRS system and eight channels over the right DPFC. During the experiment, sleep-deprived subjects drove a vehicle in a driving simulator while their cerebral oxygen regulation (CORE) state was continuously measured. Vector phase analysis (VPA) was used as a classifier to detect drowsiness state along with sleep stage-based threshold criteria. Extensive training and testing with various feature sets and classifiers are done to justify the adaptation of threshold criteria for any subject without requiring recalibration. Three statistical features (mean oxyhemoglobin, signal peak, and the sum of peaks) along with six VPA features (trajectory slopes of VPA indices) were used. The average accuracies for the five classifiers are 90.9% for discriminant analysis, 92.5% for support vector machines, 92.3% for nearest neighbors, 92.4% for both decision trees, and ensembles over all subjects’ data. Trajectory slopes of CORE vector magnitude and angle: m(|R|) and m(∠R) are the best-performing features, along with ensemble classifier with the highest accuracy of 95.3% and minimum computation time of 40 ms. The statistical significance of the results is validated with a p-value of less than 0.05. The proposed passive BCI scheme demonstrates a promising technique for online drowsiness detection using VPA along with sleep stage classification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The quality of arm movements typically improves in the sub-acute phase of stroke affecting the upper extremity. Here, we used whole arm kinematic analysis during reaching movements to distinguish whether these improvements are due to true recovery or to compensation. Fifty-three participants with post-acute stroke performed ∼80 reaching movement tests during 4 weeks of training with the ArmeoSpring exoskeleton. All participants showed improvements in end-effector performance, as measured by movement smoothness. Four ArmeoSpring angles, shoulder horizontal (SH) rotation, shoulder elevation (SE), elbow rotation, and forearm rotation, were recorded and analyzed. We first characterized healthy joint coordination patterns by performing a sparse principal component analysis on these four joint velocities recorded during reaching tests performed by young control participants. We found that two dominant joint correlations [SH with elbow rotation and SE with forearm rotation] explained over 95% of variance of joint velocity data. We identified two clusters of stroke participants by comparing the evolution of these two correlations in all tests. In the “Recoverer” cluster (N = 19), both joint correlations converged toward the respective correlations for control participants. Thus, Recoverers relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements while developing joint movement patterns similar to those of control participants. In the “Compensator” cluster (N = 34), at least one of the two joint correlations diverged from the corresponding correlation of control participants. Compensators relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements by discovering various new compensatory movement patterns dissimilar to those of control participants. New compensatory patterns included atypical decoupling of the SE and forearm joints, and atypical coupling of the SH rotation and elbow joints. There was no difference in clinical impairment level between the two groups either at the onset or at the end of training as assessed with the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer scale. However, at the start of training, the Recoverers showed significantly faster improvements in end-effector movement smoothness than the Compensators. Our analysis can be used to inform neurorehabilitation clinicians on how to provide movement feedback during practice and suggest avenues for refining exoskeleton robot therapy to reduce compensatory patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Contrasting Electroencephalography-Derived Entropy and Neural Oscillations With Highly Skilled Meditators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation is an umbrella term for a number of mental training practices designed to improve the monitoring and regulation of attention and emotion. Some forms of meditation are now being used for clinical intervention. To accompany the increased clinical interest in meditation, research investigating the neural basis of these practices is needed. A central hypothesis of contemplative neuroscience is that meditative states, which are unique on a phenomenological level, differ on a neurophysiological level. To identify the electrophysiological correlates of meditation practice, the electrical brain activity of highly skilled meditators engaging in one of six meditation styles (shamatha, vipassana, zazen, dzogchen, tonglen, and visualization) was recorded. A mind-wandering task served as a control. Lempel–Ziv complexity showed differences in nonlinear brain dynamics (entropy) during meditation compared with mind wandering, suggesting that meditation, regardless of practice, affects neural complexity. In contrast, there were no differences in power spectra at six different frequency bands, likely due to the fact that participants engaged in different meditation practices. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest neurological differences among meditation practices. These findings highlight the importance of studying the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of different meditative practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tremor-Suppression Orthoses for the Upper Limb: Current Developments and Future Challenges</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622535</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622535</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Pathological tremor is the most common motor disorder in adults and characterized by involuntary, rhythmic muscular contraction leading to shaking movements in one or more parts of the body. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and biomechanical loading using wearable orthoses have emerged as effective and non-invasive methods for tremor suppression. A variety of upper-limb orthoses for tremor suppression have been introduced; however, a systematic review of the mechanical design, algorithms for tremor extraction, and the experimental design is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To address this gap, we applied a standard systematic review methodology to conduct a literature search in the PubMed and PMC databases. Inclusion criteria and full-text access eligibility were used to filter the studies from the search results. Subsequently, we extracted relevant information, such as suppression mechanism, system weights, degrees of freedom (DOF), algorithms for tremor estimation, experimental settings, and the efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results show that the majority of tremor-suppression orthoses are active with 47% prevalence. Active orthoses are also the heaviest with an average weight of 561 ± 467 g, followed by semi-active 486 ± 395 g, and passive orthoses 191 ± 137 g. Most of the orthoses only support one DOF (54.5%). Two-DOF and three-DOF orthoses account for 33 and 18%, respectively. The average efficacy of tremor suppression using wearable orthoses is 83 ± 13%. Active orthoses are the most efficient with an average efficacy of 83 ± 8%, following by the semi-active 77 ± 19%, and passive orthoses 75 ± 12%. Among different experimental setups, bench testing shows the highest efficacy at 95 ± 5%, this value dropped to 86 ± 8% when evaluating with tremor-affected subjects. The majority of the orthoses (92%) measured voluntary and/or tremorous motions using biomechanical sensors (e.g., IMU, force sensor). Only one system was found to utilize EMG for tremor extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our review showed an improvement in efficacy of using robotic orthoses in tremor suppression. However, significant challenges for the translations of these systems into clinical or home use remain unsolved. Future challenges include improving the wearability of the orthoses (e.g., lightweight, aesthetic, and soft structure), and user control interfaces (i.e., neural machine interface). We also suggest addressing non-technical challenges (e.g., regulatory compliance, insurance reimbursement) to make the technology more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: What to Expect When the Unexpected Becomes Expected: Harmonic Surprise and Preference Over Time in Popular Music</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.578644</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.578644</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous work demonstrates that music with more surprising chords tends to be perceived as more enjoyable than music with more conventional harmonic structures. In that work, harmonic surprise was computed based upon a static distribution of chords. This would assume that harmonic surprise is constant over time, and the effect of harmonic surprise on music preference is similarly static. In this study we assess that assumption and establish that the relationship between harmonic surprise (as measured according to a specific time period) and music preference is not constant as time goes on. Analyses of harmonic surprise and preference from 1958 to 1991 showed increased harmonic surprise over time, and that this increase was significantly more pronounced in preferred songs. Separate analyses showed similar increases over the years from 2000 to 2019. As such, these findings provide evidence that the human perception of tonality is influenced by exposure. Baseline harmonic expectations that were developed through listening to the music of “yesterday” are violated in the music of “today,” leading to preference. Then, once the music of “today” provides the baseline expectations for the music of “tomorrow,” more pronounced violations—and with them, higher harmonic surprise values—become associated with preference formation. We call this phenomenon the “Inflationary-Surprise Hypothesis.” Support for this hypothesis could impact the understanding of how the perception of tonality, and other statistical regularities, are developed in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuits in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) play a pivotal role in the learning and memory formation, and processing of emotionally salient experiences, particularly aversive ones. A diverse population of GABAergic neurons present in the BLA orchestrate local circuits to mediate emotional memory functions. Targeted manipulation of GABAergic neuronal subtypes has shed light on cell-type specific functional roles in the fear learning and memory, revealing organizing principles for the operation of inhibitory circuit motifs in the BLA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopaminergic Projections From the Ventral Tegmental Area to the Nucleus Accumbens Modulate Sevoflurane Anesthesia in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of the dopaminergic pathway in general anesthesia and its potential mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we usedc-Fos staining combined with calcium fiber photometry recording to explore the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons(VTA-DA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons during sevoflurane anesthesia. A genetically encoded dopamine (DA) sensor was used to investigate thefunction of the NAc in sevoflurane anesthesia. Chemogenetics and optogenetics were used to explore the role of the VTA-DA in sevofluraneanesthesia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra, time of loss of righting reflex (LORR) and recovery of righting reflex (RORR) were recorded asassessment indicators. We found that VTA-DA and NAc neurons were inhibited during the induction period and were activated during the recoveryperiod of sevoflurane anesthesia. The fluorescence signals of dopamine decreased in the induction of and increased in the emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia.Activation of VTA-DA and the VTA&lt;sup&gt;DA&lt;/sup&gt;-NAc pathway delayed the induction and facilitated the emergence accompanying with thereduction of delta band and the augmentation of the gamma band. These data demonstrate that VTA-DA neurons play a critical role in modulating sevofluraneanesthesia via the VTA&lt;sup&gt;DA&lt;/sup&gt;-NAc pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: An Evolutionary Microcircuit Approach to the Neural Basis of High Dimensional Sensory Processing in Olfaction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.658480</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Odor stimuli consist of thousands of possible molecules, each molecule with many different properties, each property a dimension of the stimulus. Processing these high dimensional stimuli would appear to require many stages in the brain to reach odor perception, yet, in mammals, after the sensory receptors this is accomplished through only two regions, the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. We take a first step toward a fundamental understanding by identifying the sequence of local operations carried out by microcircuits in the pathway. Parallel research provided strong evidence that processed odor information is spatial representations of odor molecules that constitute odor images in the olfactory bulb and odor objects in olfactory cortex. Paleontology provides a unique advantage with evolutionary insights providing evidence that the basic architecture of the olfactory pathway almost from the start ∼330 million years ago (mya) has included an overwhelming input from olfactory sensory neurons combined with a large olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex to process that input, driven by olfactory receptor gene duplications. We identify a sequence of over 20 microcircuits that are involved, and expand on results of research on several microcircuits that give the best insights thus far into the nature of the high dimensional processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Extracellular ATP-Induced Alterations in Extracellular H+ Fluxes From Cultured Cortical and Hippocampal Astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640217</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Small alterations in the level of extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can profoundly alter neuronal activity throughout the nervous system. In this study, self-referencing H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective microelectrodes were used to examine extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes from individual astrocytes. Activation of astrocytes cultured from mouse hippocampus and rat cortex with extracellular ATP produced a pronounced increase in extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux. The ATP-elicited increase in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux appeared to be independent of bicarbonate transport, as ATP increased H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux regardless of whether the primary extracellular pH buffer was 26 mM bicarbonate or 1 mM HEPES, and persisted when atmospheric levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were replaced by oxygen. Adenosine failed to elicit any change in extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes, and ATP-mediated increases in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux were inhibited by the P2 inhibitors suramin and PPADS suggesting direct activation of ATP receptors. Extracellular ATP also induced an intracellular rise in calcium in cultured astrocytes, and ATP-induced rises in both calcium and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux were significantly attenuated when calcium re-loading into the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by thapsigargin. Replacement of extracellular sodium with choline did not significantly reduce the size of the ATP-induced increases in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, and the increases in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux were not significantly affected by addition of EIPA, suggesting little involvement of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchangers in ATP-elicited increases in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux. Given the high sensitivity of voltage-sensitive calcium channels on neurons to small changes in levels of free H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, we hypothesize that the ATP-mediated extrusion of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from astrocytes may play a key role in regulating signaling at synapses within the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Plume Dynamics Structure the Spatiotemporal Activity of Mitral/Tufted Cell Networks in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.633757</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although mice locate resources using turbulent airborne odor plumes, the stochasticity and intermittency of fluctuating plumes create challenges for interpreting odor cues in natural environments. Population activity within the olfactory bulb (OB) is thought to process this complex spatial and temporal information, but how plume dynamics impact odor representation in this early stage of the mouse olfactory system is unknown. Limitations in odor detection technology have made it difficult to measure plume fluctuations while simultaneously recording from the mouse's brain. Thus, previous studies have measured OB activity following controlled odor pulses of varying profiles or frequencies, but this approach only captures a subset of features found within olfactory plumes. Adequately sampling this feature space is difficult given a lack of knowledge regarding which features the brain extracts during exposure to natural olfactory scenes. Here we measured OB responses to naturally fluctuating odor plumes using a miniature, adapted odor sensor combined with wide-field GCaMP6f signaling from the dendrites of mitral and tufted (MT) cells imaged in olfactory glomeruli of head-fixed mice. We precisely tracked plume dynamics and imaged glomerular responses to this fluctuating input, while varying flow conditions across a range of ethologically-relevant values. We found that a consistent portion of MT activity in glomeruli follows odor concentration dynamics, and the strongest responding glomeruli are the best at following fluctuations within odor plumes. Further, the reliability and average response magnitude of glomerular populations of MT cells are affected by the flow condition in which the animal samples the plume, with the fidelity of plume following by MT cells increasing in conditions of higher flow velocity where odor dynamics result in intermittent whiffs of stronger concentration. Thus, the flow environment in which an animal encounters an odor has a large-scale impact on the temporal representation of an odor plume in the OB. Additionally, across flow conditions odor dynamics are a major driver of activity in many glomerular networks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that plume dynamics structure olfactory representations in the first stage of odor processing in the mouse olfactory system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Quantitative Immunohistochemistry to Measure Regional Expression of Nurr1 in the Brain and the Effect of the Nurr1 Heterozygous Genotype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.563854</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.563854</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor Nurr1 is a member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily. Ablation of Nurr1 expression arrests mesencephalic dopamine neuron differentiation while attenuation of Nurr1 in the subiculum and hippocampus impairs learning and memory. Additionally, reduced Nurr1 expression has been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In order to better understand the overall function of Nurr1 in the brain, quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure cellular Nurr1 protein expression, across Nurr1 immunoreactive neuronal populations. Additionally, neuronal Nurr1 expression levels were compared between different brain regions in wild-type mice (+/+) and Nurr1 heterozygous mice (+/−). Regional Nurr1 protein was also investigated at various time points after a seizure induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Nurr1 protein is expressed in various regions throughout the brain, however, a wide range of Nurr1 expression levels were observed among various neuronal populations. Neurons in the parietal and temporal cortex (secondary somatosensory, insular, auditory, and temporal association cortex) had the highest relative Nurr1 expression (100%) followed closely by the claustrum/dorsal endopiriform cortex (85%) and then subiculum (76%). Lower Nurr1 protein levels were found in neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area (39%) followed by CA1 (25%) and CA3 (19%) of the hippocampus. Additionally, in the parietal and temporal cortex, two distinct populations of high and medium Nurr1 expressing neurons were observed. Comparisons between +/− and +/+ mice revealed Nurr1 protein was reduced in +/− mice by 27% in the parietal/temporal cortex, 49% in the claustrum/dorsal endopiriform cortex, 25% in the subiculum, 33% in substantia nigra pars compacta, 22% in ventral tegmental area, and 21% in CA1 region of the hippocampus. Based on these data, regional mechanisms appear to exist which can compensate for a loss of a Nurr1 allele. Following a single PTZ-induced seizure, Nurr1 protein in the dentate gyrus peaked around 2 h and returned to baseline by 8 h. Since altered Nurr1 expression has been implicated in neurologic disorders and Nurr1 agonists have showed protective effects, understanding regional protein expression of Nurr1, therefore, is necessary to understand how changes in Nurr1 expression can alter brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Hepcidin Increases Cytokines in Alzheimer’s Disease and Down’s Syndrome Dementia: Implication of Impaired Iron Homeostasis in Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The liver-derived hormone hepcidin, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, plays an important role in host defense and innate immunity due to its broad antibacterial and antiviral properties. Ferritin, an iron storage protein is often associated with iron deficiency, hypoferritinemia, hypoxia, and immune complications, which are all significant concerns for systemic infection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Down’s syndrome (DS) dementia. Serum and post-mortem brain samples were collected from AD, DS and age-matched control subjects. Serum samples were analyzed with ELISA for ferritin, hepcidin and IL-6. Additionally, post-mortem brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemistry for iron-related and inflammatory proteins. A significant increase in serum hepcidin levels was found in DS, compared to controls and AD subjects (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Hepcidin protein was visible in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus, meningeal macrophages and in the astrocytes close to the endothelium of blood vessels. Hepcidin co-localized with IL-6, indicating its anti-inflammatory properties. We found significant correlation between hypoferritinemia and elevated levels of serum hepcidin in AD and DS. Hepcidin can be transported via macrophages and the majority of the vesicular hepcidin enters the brain via a compromised blood brain barrier (BBB). Our findings provide further insight into the molecular implications of the altered iron metabolism in acute inflammation, and can aid towards the development of preventive strategies and novel treatments in the fight against neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Delirium: A Marker of Vulnerability in Older People</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.626127</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome and one of the most common presenting symptoms of acute medical illnesses in older people. Delirium can be triggered by a single cause, but in most cases, it is multifactorial as it depends on the interaction between predisposing and precipitating factors. Delirium is highly prevalent in older patients across various settings of care and correlates with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Several pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to its onset, including neurotransmitter imbalance, neuroinflammation, altered brain metabolism, and impaired neuronal network connectivity. Several screening and diagnostic tools for delirium exist, but they are unfortunately underutilized. Additionally, the diagnosis of delirium superimposed on dementia poses a formidable challenge – especially if dementia is severe. Non-pharmacological approaches for the prevention and multidomain interventions for the treatment of delirium are recommended, given that there is currently no robust evidence of drugs that can prevent or resolve delirium. This article aims to review the current understanding about delirium in older people. To achieve this goal, we will describe the epidemiology and outcomes of the syndrome, the pathophysiological mechanisms that are supposed to be involved, the most commonly used tools for screening and diagnosis, and prevention strategies and treatments recommended. This review is intended as a brief guide for clinicians in hospital wards to improve their knowledge and practice. At the end of the article, we propose an approach to improve the quality of care provided to older patients throughout a systematic detection of delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Evidence for Peripheral Immune Activation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.617370</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence has revealed that peripheral immunity is involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the results regarding the percentage of T-cell subsets are inconsistent, and the changes of immunoglobins levels have been seldom studied in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Serum levels of the percentage of T-cell subsets and immunoglobulins were measured in 761 PD patients and 761 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The correlations between the variables of peripheral immune activation (PIA) and the clinical characteristics of PD were analyzed using correlation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The pooled results showed that PD patients had higher proportional levels of CD3+ T and CD4+ T lymphocytes than healthy controls. CD8+ T cell percentages were similar in PD patients and controls, and the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in the PD population. No significant differences in IgG, IgA, or IgM levels between these two groups were found. CD4+ T cell percentage was inversely correlated with the H&amp;amp;Y stage, and IgG level was positively correlated with disease duration and UPDRS part III. Subgroup analyses showed that these associations existed in female patients, but not in male patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The enhanced immune activation in the peripheral system is indicated in PD, and dynamic alterations in CD4+ T cell percentage and IgG level suggest an active role for peripheral immunity in the disease progression, especially in female PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands’ physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees’ distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aGgdgDmNtHU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The recently reported “UK variant” (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be more infectious than previously circulating strains as a result of several changes, including the N501Y mutation. We present a 2.9-Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complex between the ACE2 receptor and N501Y spike protein ectodomains that shows Y501 inserted into a cavity at the binding interface near Y41 of ACE2. This additional interaction provides a structural explanation for the increased ACE2 affinity of the N501Y mutant, and likely contributes to its increased infectivity. However, this mutation does not result in large structural changes, enabling important neutralization epitopes to be retained in the spike receptor binding domain. We confirmed this through biophysical assays and by determining cryo-EM structures of spike protein ectodomains bound to 2 representative potent neutralizing antibody fragments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1tJUCtjdGAw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Lateral flow devices (LFDs) are quickly being implemented for use in large-scale population surveillance programs for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United Kingdom. These programs have been piloted in city-wide screening in the city of Liverpool and are now being rolled out to support care home visits and the return home of University students for the Christmas break. Here, we present data on the performance of LFDs to test almost 8,000 students at the University of Birmingham between December 2 and December 9, 2020. The performance is validated against almost 800 samples using PCR performed in the University Pillar 2 testing lab and theoretically validated on thousands of Pillar 2 PCR testing results performed on low-prevalence care home testing samples. Our data show that LFDs do not detect infections presenting with PCR Ct values over 29 to 30 as determined using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath asssay. This may be of particular importance in detecting individuals that are either at the early, or late stages of infection, and reinforces the need for frequent, recurrent testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1co_SRrjWdA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Somatosensory innervation of healthy human oral tissues</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25148</guid>

	<description>Mechanosensory neurons in the human tongue and hard palate were identified using immunohistochemical methods. In fungiform taste papillae, Meissner‐like corpuscles were found within the lamina propria and putative mechanosensory neurons were identified that surround taste buds. In filiform non‐taste papillae, end bulbs of Krause were the predominant sensory ending. Novel sensory endings were also identified, including subepithelial neuronal densities and the endings of myelinated neurons that innervate the epithelium. In the hard‐palate mucosa, Meissner corpuscles and glomerular endings were identified in the lamina propria, and Merkel‐cell neurite complexes were identified in epithelia. This rich cadre of neuronal endings is poised to mediate mechanosensory control of feeding and speech.







Abstract
The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard‐palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent fluorescent immunohistochemistry (≥2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons (βIII tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard‐palate innervation included Meissner corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell‐neurite complexes, and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contained end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelia. Fungiform papillae had Meissner corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed neuronal endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Synaptic inputs to broad thorny ganglion cells in macaque retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25156</guid>

	<description>These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua), and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified Type 1 and wavy multistratified Type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry Type 2, stellate wavy, and semilunar Type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Representation of Locomotion During Motivated Behavior in the Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is located within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and processes and facilitates goal-directed behaviors relating to emotion, reward, and motor control. However, it is unclear how ACC neurons dynamically encode motivated behavior during locomotion. In this study, we examined how information for locomotion and behavioral outcomes is temporally represented by individual and ensembles of ACC neurons in mice during a self-paced locomotor reward-based task. By recording and analyzing the activity of ACC neurons with a microdrive tetrode array while the mouse performed the locomotor task, we found that more than two-fifths of the neurons showed phasic activity relating to locomotion or the reward behavior. Some of these neurons showed significant differences in their firing rate depending on the behavioral outcome. Furthermore, by applying a demixed principal component analysis, the ACC population activity was decomposed into components representing locomotion and the previous/future outcome. These results indicated that ACC neurons dynamically integrate motor and behavioral inputs during goal-directed behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Metal ion dyshomeostasis and disparate levels of biometals like zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and selenium (Se) have been implicated as a potential causative factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this study, we have enrolled 129 children (aged 2–4 years) in North America, of which 64 children had a diagnosis of ASD and 65 were controls. Hair, nail, and blood samples were collected and quantitatively analyzed for Zn, Cu and Se using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Of the analyzed biometals, serum Se (116.83 ± 14.84 mcg/mL) was found to be significantly lower in male ASD cases compared to male healthy controls (128.21 ± 9.11 mcg/mL; p &amp;lt; 0.005). A similar trend was found for nail Se levels in ASD (1.01 ± 0.15 mcg/mL) versus that of controls (1.11 ± 0.17 mcg/mL) with a p-value of 0.0132 using a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum testing. The level of Se in ASD cohort was co-analyzed for psychometric correlation and found a negative correlation between total ADOS score and serum Se levels. However, we did not observe any significant difference in Zn, Cu, and Zn/Cu ratio in ASD cases versus controls in this cohort of North American children. Further studies are recommended to better understand the biology of the relationship between Se and ASD status.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Characterizing the diverse cell types that make up the nervous system is essential for understanding how the nervous system is structured and ultimately how it functions. The astonishing range of cellular diversity found in the nervous system emerges from a small pool of neural progenitor cells. These progenitors and their neuronal progeny proceed through sequential gene expression programs to produce different cell lineages and acquire distinct cell fates. These gene expression programs must be tightly regulated in order for the cells to achieve and maintain the proper differentiated state, remain functional throughout life, and avoid cell death. Disruption of developmental programs is associated with a wide range of abnormalities in brain structure and function, further indicating that elucidating their contribution to cellular diversity will be key to understanding brain health. A growing body of evidence suggests that tight regulation of developmental genes requires post-transcriptional regulation of the transcriptome by microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that function by binding to mRNA targets containing complementary sequences and repressing their translation into protein, thereby providing a layer of precise spatial and temporal control over gene expression. Moreover, the expression profiles and targets of miRNAs show great specificity for distinct cell types, brain regions and developmental stages, suggesting that they are an important parameter of cell type identity. Here, we provide an overview of miRNAs that are critically involved in establishing neural cell identities, focusing on how miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression modulates neural progenitor expansion, cell fate determination, cell migration, neuronal and glial subtype specification, and finally cell maintenance and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mutant PRPF8 Causes Widespread Splicing Changes in Spliceosome Components in Retinitis Pigmentosa Patient iPSC-Derived RPE Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a rare, progressive disease that affects photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with blindness as a final outcome. Despite high medical and social impact, there is currently no therapeutic options to slow down the progression of or cure the disease. The development of effective therapies was largely hindered by high genetic heterogeneity, inaccessible disease tissue, and unfaithful model organisms. The fact that components of ubiquitously expressed splicing factors lead to the retina-specific disease is an additional intriguing question. Herein, we sought to correlate the retinal cell-type-specific disease phenotype with the splicing profile shown by a patient with autosomal recessive RP, caused by a mutation in pre-mRNA splicing factor 8 (PRPF8). In order to get insight into the role of PRPF8 in homeostasis and disease, we capitalize on the ability to generate patient-specific RPE cells and reveal differentially expressed genes unique to RPE cells. We found that spliceosomal complex and ribosomal functions are crucial in determining cell-type specificity through differential expression and alternative splicing (AS) and that PRPF8 mutation causes global changes in splice site selection and exon inclusion that particularly affect genes involved in these cellular functions. This finding corroborates the hypothesis that retinal tissue identity is conferred by a specific splicing program and identifies retinal AS events as a framework toward the design of novel therapeutic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Transductive Transfer Learning for Domain Adaptation in Brain Magnetic Resonance Image Segmentation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.608808</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Segmentation of brain images from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is an indispensable step in clinical practice. Morphological changes of sub-cortical brain structures and quantification of brain lesions are considered biomarkers of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression. In recent years, deep learning methods showed an outstanding performance in medical image segmentation. However, these methods suffer from generalisability problem due to inter-centre and inter-scanner variabilities of the MRI images. The main objective of the study is to develop an automated deep learning segmentation approach that is accurate and robust to the variabilities in scanner and acquisition protocols. In this paper, we propose a transductive transfer learning approach for domain adaptation to reduce the domain-shift effect in brain MRI segmentation. The transductive scenario assumes that there are sets of images from two different domains: (1) source—images with manually annotated labels; and (2) target—images without expert annotations. Then, the network is jointly optimised integrating both source and target images into the transductive training process to segment the regions of interest and to minimise the domain-shift effect. We proposed to use a histogram loss in the feature level to carry out the latter optimisation problem. In order to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed approach, the method has been tested in two different brain MRI image segmentation problems using multi-centre and multi-scanner databases for: (1) sub-cortical brain structure segmentation; and (2) white matter hyperintensities segmentation. The experiments showed that the segmentation performance of a pre-trained model could be significantly improved by up to 10%. For the first segmentation problem it was possible to achieve a maximum improvement from 0.680 to 0.799 in average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric and for the second problem the average DSC improved from 0.504 to 0.602. Moreover, the improvements after domain adaptation were on par or showed better performance compared to the commonly used traditional unsupervised segmentation methods (FIRST and LST), also achieving faster execution time. Taking this into account, this work presents one more step toward the practical implementation of deep learning algorithms into the clinical routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Automatic Detection of Fiducial Landmarks Toward the Development of an Application for Digitizing the Locations of EEG Electrodes: Occipital Structure Sensor-Based Work</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reconstruction of electrophysiological sources within the brain is sensitive to the constructed head model, which depends on the positioning accuracy of anatomical landmarks known as fiducials. In this work, we propose an algorithm for the automatic detection of fiducial landmarks of EEG electrodes on the 3D human head model. Our proposal combines a dimensional reduction approach with a perspective projection from 3D to 2D object space; the eye and ear automatic detection in a 2D face image by two cascades of classifiers and geometric transformations to obtain 3D spatial coordinates of the landmarks and to generate the head coordinate system, This is accomplished by considering the characteristics of the scanner information. Capturing the 3D model of the head is done with Occipital Inc. ST01 structure sensor and the implementation of our algorithm was carried out on MATLAB R2018b using the Computer Vision Toolbox and the FieldTrip Toolbox. The experimental results were aimed at recursively exploring the efficacy of the facial feature detectors as a function of the projection angle; they show that robust results are obtained in terms of false acceptance rate. Our proposal is an initial step of an approach for the automatic digitization of electrode locations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method detects anatomical facial landmarks automatically, accurately, and rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) Does Not Affect Sports People’s Explosive Power: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640609</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640609</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This study is aimed to preliminary investigate whether transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) could affect explosive power considering genetic background in sport subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventeen healthy sports volunteers with at least 3 years of sports activities participated in the experiment. After 2 weeks of familiarization performed without any stimulation, each participant received either 50 Hz-tACS or sham-tACS. Before and after stimulation, subjects performed the following tests: (1) the squat jump with the hands on the hips (SJ); (2) countermovement jump with the hands on the hips (CMJ); (3) countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJ-AS); (4) 15-s Bosco’s test; (5) seated backward overhead medicine ball throw (SBOMBT); (6) seated chest pass throw (SCPT) with a 3-kg rubber medicine ball; and (7) hand-grip test. Additionally, saliva samples were collected from each participant. Genotyping analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: No significant differences were found in sport performance of subjects after 50 Hz-tACS. Additionally, we did not find any influence of genetic background on tACS-related effect on physical performance. These results suggest that tACS at gamma frequency is not able to induce an after-effect modulating sport performance. Further investigations with larger sample size are needed in order to understand the potential role of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS) in motor performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Gamma-tACS applied before the physical performance fails to improve explosive power in sport subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Life Stress and the Fate of Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636144</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636144</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early life stress (ELS) precedes alterations to neuro-immune activation, which may mediate an increased risk for stress-related psychiatric disorders, potentially through alterations of central kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites, the latter being relatively unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS in a non-human primate model would lead to a reduction of neuroprotective and increases of neurotoxic KP metabolites. Twelve adult female bonnet macaques reared under conditions of maternal variable foraging demand (VFD) were compared to 27 age- and weight-matched non-VFD-exposed female controls. Baseline behavioral observations of social affiliation were taken over a 12-week period followed by the first cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. Subjects were then either exposed to a 12-week repeated separation paradigm (RSP) or assigned to a “no-RSP” condition followed by a second CSF. We used high-performance liquid chromatography for kynurenine (KYN), tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, kynurenic acid (KYNA), and anthranilic acid (ANTH) as a proxy for quinolinic acid determination. At baseline, social affiliation scores were reduced in VFD-reared versus control subjects. CSF log KYNA and log KYNA/KYN ratio were lower in VFD-reared versus control subjects. CSF log KYNA/KYN was positively correlated with CSF log ANTH in VFD only (r = 0.82). Controlling for log KYNA/KYN, log ANTH was elevated in VFD-reared subjects versus controls. CSF log KYNA/KYN obtained post-RSP was positively correlated with mean social affiliation scores during RSP, specifically in VFD. ELS is associated with a reduced neuroprotective and increased neurotoxic pathway products. That the two contrasting processes are paradoxically correlated following ELS suggests a cross-talk between two opposing KP enzymatic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Modulatory Effects of Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation in Combination With Mirror Hand Motor Training on Functional Connectivity: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.548299</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.548299</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mirror training (MT) is an observation-based motor learning strategy. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is an accelerated form of excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that has been used to enhance the cortical excitability of the motor cortices. This study aims to investigate the combined effects of iTBS with MT on the resting state functional connectivity at alpha frequency band in healthy adults. Eighteen healthy adults were randomized into one of three groups—Group 1: iTBS plus MT, Group 2: iTBS plus sham MT, and Group 3: sham iTBS plus MT. Participants in Groups 1 and 3 observed the mirror illusion of the moving (right) hand in a plain mirror for four consecutive sessions, one session/day, while participants in Group 2 received the same training with a covered mirror. Real or sham iTBS was applied daily over right motor cortex prior to the training. Resting state electroencephalography (EEG) at baseline and post-training was recorded when participants closed their eyes. The mixed-effects model demonstrated a significant interaction effect in the coherence between FC4 and C4 channels, favoring participants in Group 1 over Group 3 (Δβ = −0.84, p = 0.048). A similar effect was also found in the coherence between FC3 and FC4 channels favoring Group 1 over Group 3 (Δβ = −0.43, p = 0.049). In contrast to sham iTBS combined with MT, iTBS combined with MT may strengthen the functional connectivity between bilateral premotor cortices and ipsilaterally within the motor cortex of the stimulated hemisphere. In contrast to sham MT, real MT, when combined with iTBS, might diminish the connectivity among the contralateral parietal–frontal areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Novel Tools and Investigative Approaches for the Study of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells (NG2-Glia) in CNS Development and Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673132</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), also referred to as NG2-glia, are the most proliferative cell type in the adult central nervous system. While the primary role of OPCs is to serve as progenitors for oligodendrocytes, in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that OPCs fulfil a number of other functions. Indeed, independent of their role as stem cells, it is evident that OPCs can regulate the metabolic environment, directly interact with and modulate neuronal function, maintain the blood brain barrier (BBB) and regulate inflammation. In this review article, we discuss the state-of-the-art tools and investigative approaches being used to characterize the biology and function of OPCs. From functional genetic investigation to single cell sequencing and from lineage tracing to functional imaging, we discuss the important discoveries uncovered by these techniques, such as functional and spatial OPC heterogeneity, novel OPC marker genes, the interaction of OPCs with other cells types, and how OPCs integrate and respond to signals from neighboring cells. Finally, we review the use of in vitro assay to assess OPC functions. These methodologies promise to lead to ever greater understanding of this enigmatic cell type, which in turn will shed light on the pathogenesis and potential treatment strategies for a number of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: In vivo Morphometry of Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL) Stratification in the Human Retina With Visible Light Optical Coherence Tomography</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;From the bipolar cells to higher brain visual centers, signals in the vertebrate visual system are transmitted along parallel on and off pathways. These two pathways are spatially segregated along the depth axis of the retina. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no way to directly assess this anatomical stratification in vivo. Here, employing ultrahigh resolution visible light Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging in humans, we report a stereotyped reflectivity pattern of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) that parallels IPL stratification. We characterize the topography of this reflectivity pattern non-invasively in a cohort of normal, young adult human subjects. This proposed correlate of IPL stratification is accessible through non-invasive ocular imaging in living humans. Topographic variations should be carefully considered when designing studies in development or diseases of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transplantation of Human Cortically-Specified Neuroepithelial Progenitor Cells Leads to Improved Functional Outcomes in a Mouse Model of Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.654290</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. Current therapeutic options are limited in terms of their time for implementation and efficacy in promoting recovery. Cell transplantation has been shown to have promise in several animal models however significant challenges remain, including the optimal source of cells to promote neural repair. Here, we report on the use of a population of human ESC derived, cortically specified, neuroepithelial precursor cells (cNEPs) that are neurally restricted in their lineage potential. CNEPs have the potential to give rise to mature neural cell types following transplantation, including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. With a view towards translation, we sought to determine whether this human cell source was effective in promoting improved functional outcomes following stroke. Undifferentiated cNEPs were transplanted in a pre-clinical endothelin-1 (ET-1) model of ischemic motor cortical stroke in immunocompromised SCID-beige mice and cellular and functional outcomes were assessed. We demonstrate that cNEP transplantation in the acute phase (4 days post-stroke) improves motor function as early as 20 days post-stroke, compared to stroke-injured, non-transplanted mice. At the time of recovery, a small fraction (&amp;lt;6%) of the transplanted cNEPs are observed within the stroke injury site. The surviving cells expressed the immature neuronal marker, doublecortin, with no differentiation into mature neural phenotypes. At longer survival times (40 days), the majority of recovered, transplanted mice had a complete absence of surviving cNEPS. Hence, human cNEPs grafted at early times post-stroke support the observed functional recovery following ET-1 stroke but their persistence is not required, thereby supporting a by-stander effect rather than cell replacement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Elovl5 Expression in the Central Nervous System of the Adult Mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ELOVL5 (Elongase of Very-Long Fatty Acid 5) gene encodes for an enzyme that elongates long chain fatty acids, with a marked preference for polyunsaturated molecules. In particular, it plays an essential role in the elongation of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, precursors for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Mutations of ELOVL5 cause the spino-cerebellar ataxia type 38 (SCA38), a rare autosomal neurological disease characterized by gait abnormality, dysarthria, dysphagia, hyposmia and peripheral neuropathy, conditions well represented by a mouse model with a targeted deletion of this gene (Elovl5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice). However, the expression pattern of this enzyme in neuronal and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) is still uninvestigated. This work is aimed at filling this gap of knowledge by taking advantage of an Elovl5-reporter mouse line and immunofluorescence analyses on adult mouse CNS sections and glial cell primary cultures. Notably, Elovl5 appears expressed in a region- and cell type-specific manner. Abundant Elovl5-positive cells were found in the cerebellum, brainstem, and primary and accessory olfactory regions, where mitral cells show the most prominent expression. Hippocampal pyramidal cells of CA2/CA3 where also moderately labeled, while in the rest of the telencephalon Elovl5 expression was high in regions related to motor control. Analysis of primary glial cell cultures revealed Elovl5 expression in oligodendroglial cells at various maturation steps and in microglia, while astrocytes showed a heterogeneous in vivo expression of Elovl5. The elucidation of Elovl5 CNS distribution provides relevant information to understand the physiological functions of this enzyme and its PUFA products, whose unbalance is known to be involved in many pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Widespread Doublecortin Expression in the Cerebral Cortex of the Octodon degus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.656882</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.656882</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been demonstrated that in adulthood rodents show newly born neurons in the subgranular layer (SGL) of the dentate gyrus (DG), and in the subventricular zone (SVZ). The neurons generated in the SVZ migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb. One of the markers of newly generated neurons is doublecortin (DCX). The degu similarly shows significant numbers of DCX-labeled neurons in the SGL, SVZ, and RMS. Further, most of the nuclei of these DCX-expressing neurons are also labeled by proliferating nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67. Finally, whereas in rats and mice DCX-labeled neurons are predominantly present in the SGL and SVZ, with only a few DCX neurons present in piriform cortex, the degu also shows significant numbers of DCX expressing neurons in areas outside of SVZ, DG, and PC. Many areas of neocortex in degu demonstrate DCX-labeled neurons in layer II, and most of these neurons are found in the limbic cortices. The DCX-labeled cells do not stain with NeuN, indicating they are immature neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Proposed Hypothesis on Dementia: Inflammation, Small Vessel Disease, and Hypoperfusion Is the Sequence That Links All Harmful Lifestyles to Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.679837</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.679837</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is growing consensus that certain lifestyles can contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia, but the physiological steps that link a harmful lifestyle to its negative impact are not always evident. It is also unclear whether all lifestyles that contribute to dementia do so through the same intermediary steps. This article will focus on three lifestyles known to be risk factors for dementia, namely obesity, sedentary behavior, and insufficient sleep, and offer a unifying hypothesis proposing that lifestyles that negatively impact cognition do so through the same sequence of events: inflammation, small vessel disease, decline in cerebral perfusion, and brain atrophy. The hypothesis will then be tested in a recently identified risk factor for dementia, namely hearing deficit. If further studies confirm this sequence of events leading to dementia, a significant change in our approach to this debilitating and costly condition may be necessary, possible, and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effect of Cognitive Control on Attentional Processing of Emotional Information Among Older Adults: Evidence From an Eye-Tracking Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.644379</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.644379</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although numerous studies have suggested that the gradually increasing selective preference for positive information over negative information in older adults depends on cognitive control processes, few have reported the characteristics of different attention stages in the emotional processing of older individuals. The present study used a real-time eye-tracking technique to disentangle the attentional engagement and disengagement processes involved in age-related positivity effect (PE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eye movement data from a spatial-cueing task were obtained for 32 older and 32 younger healthy participants. The spatial-cueing task with varied cognitive loads appeared to be an effective way to explore the role of cognitive control during the attention engagement and disengagement stages of emotion processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with younger adults, older participants showed more positive gaze preferences when cognitive resources were sufficient for face processing at the attention engagement stage. However, the age-related PE was not observed at the attention disengagement stage because older adults had more difficulty disengaging from fearful faces than did the younger adults due to the consumption of attention by the explicit target judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study highlights how cognitive control moderates positive gaze preferences at different attention processing stages. These findings may have far-reaching implications for understanding, preventing, and intervening in unsuccessful aging and, thus, in promoting active and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Automated Midline Estimation for Symmetry Analysis of Cerebral Hemispheres in FLAIR MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.644137</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.644137</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To perform brain asymmetry studies in large neuroimaging archives, reliable and automatic detection of the interhemispheric fissure (IF) is needed to first extract the cerebral hemispheres. The detection of the IF is often referred to as mid-sagittal plane estimation, as this plane separates the two cerebral hemispheres. However, traditional planar estimation techniques fail when the IF presents a curvature caused by existing pathology or a natural phenomenon known as brain torque. As a result, midline estimates can be inaccurate. In this study, a fully unsupervised midline estimation technique is proposed that is comprised of three main stages: head angle correction, control point estimation and midline generation. The control points are estimated using a combination of intensity, texture, gradient, and symmetry-based features. As shown, the proposed method automatically adapts to IF curvature, is applied on a slice-to-slice basis for more accurate results and also provides accurate delineation of the midline in the septum pellucidum, which is a source of failure for traditional approaches. The method is compared to two state-of-the-art methods for midline estimation and is validated using 75 imaging volumes (~3,000 imaging slices) acquired from 38 centers of subjects with dementia and vascular disease. The proposed method yields the lowest average error across all metrics: Hausdorff distance (HD) was 0.32 ± 0.23, mean absolute difference (MAD) was 1.10 ± 0.38 mm and volume difference was 7.52 ± 5.40 and 5.35 ± 3.97 ml, for left and right hemispheres, respectively. Using the proposed method, the midline was extracted for 5,360 volumes (~275K images) from 83 centers worldwide, acquired by GE, Siemens and Philips scanners. An asymmetry index was proposed that automatically detected outlier segmentations (which were &amp;lt;1% of the total dataset). Using the extracted hemispheres, hemispheric asymmetry texture biomarkers of the normal-appearing brain matter (NABM) were analyzed in a dementia cohort, and significant differences in biomarker means were found across SCI and MCI and SCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Complexity of Blood Pressure Fluctuation Mediated the Effects of Hypertension on Walking Speed in Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Older adults with hypertension often had diminished walking performance. The underlying mechanism through which hypertension affects walking performance, however, has not been fully understood. We here measured the complexity of the continuous systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure fluctuation, grade of white matter lesions (WMLs), and cognitive function and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the interrelationships between hypertension, BP complexity, WMLs, cognitive function, and walking speed in single- and dual-task conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 152 older adults with age &amp;gt; 60 years (90 hypertensive and 62 normotensive participants) completed one MRI scan of brain structure, a finger BP assessment of at least 10 min, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive function, and 10-meter walking tests in single (i.e., normal walking) and dual tasks (i.e., walking while performing a serial subtraction of three from a random three-digit number). The grade of WMLs was assessed using the total score of Fazekas scale; the complexity of SBP and DBP was measured using multiscale entropy (MSE), and the walking performance was assessed by walking speed in single- and dual-task conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: As compared to normotensives, hypertensive older adults had significantly slower walking speed, lower complexity of SBP and DBP, greater grade of WMLs, and poorer cognitive function (p &amp;lt; 0.03). Those with lower BP complexity (β &amp;gt; 0.31, p &amp;lt; 0.003), greater WML grade (β &amp;lt; −0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.0002), and/or poorer cognitive function (β &amp;lt; −0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) had slower walking speed in single- and/or dual-task conditions. The SEM model demonstrated significant total effects of hypertension on walking speed, and such effects were mediated by BP complexity only, or BP complexity, WML grade, and cognitive function together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study demonstrates the cross-sectional association between the complexity of continuous beat-to-beat BP fluctuation, WML grade, cognitive function, and walking speed in hypertensive and normotensive older adults, revealing a potential mechanism that hypertension may affect walking performance in older adults through diminished BP complexity, increased WML grade, and decreased cognitive function, and BP complexity is an important factor for such effects. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm the findings in this study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased MANF Expression in the Inferior Temporal Gyrus in Patients With Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.639318</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is an aging-related disorder linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The main pathologic feature of AD is the presence of extracellular senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. In neurodegenerative diseases, the unfolded protein response (UPR) induced by ER stress ensures cell survival. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) protects against ER stress and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. MANF is expressed in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. However, there have been no investigations on MANF expression in the brain of AD patients. This was addressed in the present study by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative analyses of postmortem brain specimens. We examined the localization and expression levels of MANF in the inferior temporal gyrus of the cortex (ITGC) in AD patients (n = 5), preclinical (pre-)AD patients (n = 5), and age-matched non-dementia controls (n = 5) by double immunofluorescence labeling with antibodies against the neuron-specific nuclear protein neuronal nuclei (NeuN), ER chaperone protein 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and MANF. The results showed that MANF was mainly expressed in neurons of the ITGC in all 3 groups; However, the number of MANF-positive neurons was significantly higher in pre-AD (Braak stage III/IV) and AD (Braak stage V/VI) patients than that in the control group. Thus, MANF is overexpressed in AD and pre-AD, suggesting that it can serve as a diagnostic marker for early stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of APOE ε2 on the Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Study Based on the Resting-State Functional MRI</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 is a protective genetic factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the potential interaction effects between the APOE ε2 allele and disease status on the intrinsic brain activity remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We identified 73 healthy control (HC) with APOE ε3/ε3, 61 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with APOE ε3/ε3, 24 HC with APOE ε2/ε3, and 10 MCI subjects with APOE ε2/ε3 from the ADNI database. All subjects underwent a resting-state functional MRI and Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We used a fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to explore the spontaneous brain activity. Based on the mixed-effects analysis, we explored the interaction effects between the APOE ε2 allele versus disease status on brain activity and metabolism in a voxel-wise fashion (GRF corrected, p &amp;lt; 0.01), followed by post hoc two-sample t-tests (Bonferroni corrected, p &amp;lt; 0.05). We then investigated the relationship between the mean imaging metrics and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There are no significant differences in gender, age, or education among the four groups. The interaction effect on brain activity was located in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Post hoc analysis showed that APOE ε2/ε3 MCI had an increased IPL fALFF than APOE ε3/ε3 MCI. Regarding the APOE ε2 allele effects, we found that ε2 carriers had a decreased fALFF in the transverse temporal gyrus than non-carriers. Also, FDG-PET results showed a lower SUVR of the frontal lobe in APOE ε2 carriers than non-carriers. Furthermore, fALFF of IPL was correlated with the visuospatial function (r = −0.16, p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;APOE ε2 carriers might have a better brain reservation when coping with AD-related pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The cover photo shows a confocal fluorescence microscopy image of Synaptotagmin‐1 (Yellow‐red) and dendritic marker MAP‐2 (Blue) labeled by immunocytochemistry in 3‐week‐old rat cortical neurons cultured in vitro from day 17 embryos. Synaptotagmin‐1 is localized to synaptic vesicles and is the trigger for calcium‐induced exocytosis at synaptic terminals. Fluorescence image was acquired with a 60X oil immersion objective of Olympus Confocal microscope FV1000 as Z stacks (1µm intervals) projected by maximum fluorescence intensity.

	<description>We demonstrate a critical role for ERK signaling in microglia in Alzheimer’s disease using a preclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and quantitative studies of postmortem human brains.

Abstract
The importance of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling in regulating microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We examined the role of MAPK signaling in microglia using a preclinical model of AD pathology and quantitative proteomics studies of postmortem human brains. In multiplex immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins in acutely isolated microglia and brain tissue from 5xFAD mice, we found phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) was the most strongly upregulated phosphoprotein within the MAPK pathway in acutely isolated microglia, but not whole‐brain tissue from 5xFAD mice. The importance of ERK signaling in primary microglia cultures was next investigated using transcriptomic profiling and functional assays of amyloid‐β and neuronal phagocytosis, which confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFNγ‐mediated pro‐inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also partly important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho‐ERK was an upstream regulator of disease‐associated microglial gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2), indicative of the importance of microglial ERK signaling in AD pathology. Quantitative proteomic analyses of postmortem human brain showed that ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. In a human brain phosphoproteomic study, we found evidence for increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway in AD. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation, particularly in microglia in mouse models, is a regulator of pro‐inflammatory immune responses in AD pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Control of wakefulness by lateral hypothalamic glutamatergic neurons in male mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24828</guid>

	<description>The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a center for the control of wakefulness. The present study reveals an important role of excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons in controlling wakefulness. Activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induces rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness and maintains wakefulness, whereas their inhibition decreases wakefulness and increases sleep.

Abstract
The lateral hypothalamus (LH) plays a key role in the maintenance of cortical activation and wakefulness. In the LH, the two main neuronal cell populations consist of excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Recent studies have shown that inhibitory LH GABAergic neurons are wake‐promoting. However, the mechanism by which excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons contribute to sleep‐wake regulation remains unclear. Using fiber photometry in male mice, we demonstrated that LH glutamatergic neurons exhibited high activities during both wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. Chemogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an increase in wakefulness that lasted for 6 hr, whereas suppression of LH glutamatergic neuronal activity caused a reduction in wakefulness. Brief optogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an immediate transition from slow‐wave sleep to wakefulness, and long‐lasting optogenetic stimulation of these neurons maintained wakefulness. Moreover, we found that LH‐locus coeruleus/parabrachial nucleus and LH‐basal forebrain projections mediated the wake‐promoting effects of LH glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our data indicate that LH glutamatergic neurons are essential for the induction and maintenance of wakefulness. The results presented here may advance our understanding of the role of LH in the control of wakefulness.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases 2 (Erk2) and Erk5 in the central nervous system differentially contribute to central sensitization in male mice</title>

	<description>Using genetic deletion in mice, we demonstrate that extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) plays important roles in central sensitization in formalin‐induced inflammatory pain. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 and Erk5 are involved in discrete but parallel mechanisms underlying central sensitization in the early second phase of formalin‐induced nociceptive behaviors. 

Abstract
Nervous systems are designed to become extra sensitive to afferent nociceptive stimuli under certain circumstances such as inflammation and nerve injury. How pain hypersensitivity comes about is key issue in the field since it ultimately results in chronic pain. Central sensitization represents enhanced pain sensitivity due to increased neural signaling within the central nervous system (CNS). Particularly, much evidence indicates that underlying mechanism of central sensitization is associated with the change of spinal neurons. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases have received attention as key molecules in central sensitization. Previously, we revealed the isoform‐specific function of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) in spinal neurons for central sensitization using mice with Cre‐loxP‐mediated deletion of Erk2 in the CNS. Still, how extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) in spinal neurons contributes to central sensitization has not been directly tested, nor is the functional relevance of Erk5 and Erk2 known. Here, we show that Erk5 and Erk2 in the CNS play redundant and/or distinct roles in central sensitization, depending on the plasticity context (cell types, pain types, time, etc.). We used male mice with Erk5 deletion specifically in the CNS and found that Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in a formalin‐induced inflammatory pain model. Deletion of both Erk2 and Erk5 leads to greater attenuation of central sensitization in this model, compared to deletion of either isoform alone. Conversely, Erk2 but not Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage. Our results suggest the elaborate mechanisms of Erk signaling in central sensitization.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Enriched environment ameliorates chronic temporal lobe epilepsy‐induced behavioral hyperexcitability and restores synaptic plasticity in CA3–CA1 synapses in male Wistar rats</title>

	<description>Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral excitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, and synaptophysin expression, which was ameliorated by exposure to enriched environment.

Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsies. Pharmacoresistance and comorbidities pose significant challenges to its treatment necessitating the development of non‐pharmacological approaches. In an earlier study, exposure to enriched environment (EE) reduced seizure frequency and duration and ameliorated chronic epilepsy‐induced depression in rats. However, the cellular basis of beneficial effects of EE remains unknown. Accordingly, in the current study, we evaluated the effects of EE in chronic epilepsy‐induced changes in behavioral hyperexcitability, synaptic transmission, synaptophysin (SYN), and calbindin (CB) expression, hippocampal subfield volumes and cell density in male Wistar rats. Epilepsy was induced by lithium–pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus. Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, increased paired‐pulse facilitation ratio, decreased hippocampal subfields volumes. Moreover, epileptic rats showed decreased synaptophysin and CB expression in the hippocampus. Six weeks post‐SE, epileptic rats were exposed to EE for 2 weeks, 6 hr/day. EE significantly reduced the behavioral hyperexcitability and restored basal synaptic transmission correlating with increased expression of SYN and CB. Our results reaffirm the beneficial effects of EE on behavior in chronic epilepsy and establishes some of the putative cellular mechanisms. Since drug resistance and comorbidities are a major concern in TLE, we propose EE as a potent non‐pharmacological treatment modality to mitigate these changes in chronic epilepsy.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Ipsilateral motor pathways to the lower limb after stroke: Insights and opportunities</title>

	<description>Abstract
Stroke‐related damage to the crossed lateral corticospinal tract causes motor deficits in the contralateral (paretic) limb. To restore functional movement in the paretic limb, the nervous system may increase its reliance on ipsilaterally descending motor pathways, including the uncrossed lateral corticospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, the rubrospinal tract, and the vestibulospinal tract. Our knowledge about the role of these pathways for upper limb motor recovery is incomplete, and even less is known about the role of these pathways for lower limb motor recovery. Understanding the role of ipsilateral motor pathways to paretic lower limb movement and recovery after stroke may help improve our rehabilitative efforts and provide alternate solutions to address stroke‐related impairments. These advances are important because walking and mobility impairments are major contributors to long‐term disability after stroke, and improving walking is a high priority for individuals with stroke. This perspective highlights evidence regarding the contributions of ipsilateral motor pathways from the contralesional hemisphere and spinal interneuronal pathways for paretic lower limb movement and recovery. This perspective also identifies opportunities for future research to expand our knowledge about ipsilateral motor pathways and provides insights into how this information may be used to guide rehabilitation.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore for neuroprotection in a piglet model of neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy</title>

	<description>GNX‐4728, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, does not protect against hypoxia‐ischemia induced neuronal necrosis in piglet putamen (indicated by bolt strike zone). Acute depletion of mitochondrial SOD2 and developmental differences in mitochondrial proteins, such as CypD, may limit the efficacy of mitochondrial‐targeted drugs for neonatal brain injury.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes significant morbidity despite treatment with therapeutic hypothermia. Mitochondrial dysfunction may drive the mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death, thereby making mitochondria prime targets for neuroprotection. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is one such target within mitochondria. In adult animal models, mPTP inhibition is neuroprotective. However, evidence for mPTP inhibition in neonatal models of neurologic disease is less certain. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of the mPTP small molecule inhibitor GNX‐4728 and examined the developmental presence of brain mPTP proteins for drug targeting in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury. Male neonatal piglets were randomized to hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) or sham procedure with GNX‐4728 (15 mg/kg, IV) or vehicle (saline/cyclodextrin/DMSO, IV). GNX‐4728 was administered as a single dose within 5 min after resuscitation from bradycardic arrest. Normal, ischemic, and injured neurons were counted in putamen and somatosensory cortex using hematoxylin and eosin staining. In separate neonatal and juvenile pigs, western blots of putamen mitochondrial‐enriched fractions were used to evaluate mitochondrial integrity and the presence of mPTP proteins. We found that a single dose of GNX‐4728 did not protect putamen and cortical neurons from cell death after HI. However, loss of mitochondrial matrix integrity occurred within 6h after HI, and while mPTP components are present in the neonatal brain their levels were significantly different compared to that of a mature juvenile brain. Thus, the neonatal brain mPTP may not be a good target for current neurotherapeutic drugs that are developed based on adult mitochondria.</description>

	<description>The study revealed a significant reduction of frequency and severity of seizure in patients of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults who were treated with valproate and melatonin

Abstract
Epilepsy treatment is challenging because of multiple impediments like lack of efficacy of monotherapy, adverse drug reactions, and different comorbidities. Add‐on therapy to first‐line antiepileptics may be the option to overcome therapeutic hurdles. The present randomized, double‐blind, add‐on placebo‐controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of add‐on melatonin in the treatment of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizure in adults. The control group (n = 52) received add‐on placebo, and the test group (n = 52) received add‐on melatonin (3 mg/day) with valproate (20 mg/kg in two divided doses). Clinical evaluation of seizure frequency, Chalfont‐National Hospital seizure severity scale (NHS3), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), quality of life in epilepsy inventory, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and biochemical estimation of serum neuron‐specific enolase (NSE) and glutathione reductase were done at baseline and compared with follow‐up at 8 weeks. Among 104 patients randomized [mean (SD) age of 27.6 (11.5); 84 (80.8%) male], 88 (84.6%) completed the trial. The responder rate and seizure‐free rate in the test group were significantly (p = 0.006 and 0.034) higher than the control group. There was a significantly higher reduction in the frequency of seizures (p = 0.016) and NHS3 (−2.39; 95%CI: −4.56 to −0.21; p = 0.032) in the test group compared to the control group. Similarly, improvement in PSQI (−1.40; 95%CI: −2.64 to −0.15; p = 0.029) was significantly better in the test group. There was no significant difference in the change in ESS (p = 0.621) and quality of life scoring (p = 0.456) between the study groups. The decrease in serum NSE was significantly higher with the test group compared to the control group (−2.01; 95% CI: −3.74 to −0.27; p = 0.024). Add‐on melatonin increased serum glutathione reductase significantly (p = 0.038), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.685). Add‐on melatonin with valproate for generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults can achieve a significantly better clinical outcome by reducing the seizure frequency, severity and attaining a better seizure‐free rate in comparison to the control group.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Ground state depletion followed by individual molecule return microscopy (GSDIM) has been used in the past to study the nanoscale distribution of protein co‐localization in living cells. We now demonstrate the successful application of GSDIM to archival human brain tissue sections including from Alzheimer's disease cases as well as experimental tissue samples from mouse and zebrafish larvae. Presynaptic terminals and microglia and their cell processes were visualized at a resolution beyond diffraction‐limited light microscopy, allowing clearer insights into their interactions in situ. The procedure described here offers time and cost savings compared to electron microscopy and opens the spectrum of molecular imaging using antibodies and super‐resolution microscopy to the analysis of routine formalin‐fixed paraffin sections of archival human brain. The investigation of microglia–synapse interactions in dementia will be of special interest in this context.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Olfactory ensheathing cells: Unique glial cells promising for treatments of spinal cord injury</title>

	<description>Schematic drawing of the olfactory system. Olfactory mucosa contains olfactory receptor neurons (yellow), extending from the olfactory epithelia to the olfactory bulb (OB). Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) ensheath axons of olfactory receptor neurons until they reach glomeruli. Two subtypes of OECs residing within olfactory mucosa (OM) and OB and named accordingly as OM‐OECs (purple) and OB‐OECs (blue), respectively. Two subtypes of OECs with their secretions, affecting neuronal repair on spinal cord injuries (SCI) differently. OM‐OECs secrete molecules related to extracellular matrix remodeling such as laminin, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and transforming growth factor‐β3 (TGF‐β3). Meanwhile, OB‐OECs secrete molecules promoting neuronal proliferation and axonal growth such as NGF, GDNF, BDNF neuregulin, and other neurotrophins

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally the consequence of physical damage, which may result in devastating consequences such as paraplegia or paralysis. Some certain candidates for SCI repair are olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which are unique glial cells located in the transition region of the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system and perform neuron regeneration in the olfactory system throughout life. Culture studies have clarified many properties of OECs, but their mechanisms of actions are not fully understood. Successful results achieved in animal models showcased that SCI treatment with OEC transplants is suitable for clinical trials. However, clinical trials are limited by difficulties like cell acquisition for autograft transplantation. Despite the improvements in both animal and clinical studies so far, there is still insufficient information about the mechanism of actions, adverse effects, proper application methods, effective subtypes, and sources of cells. This review summarizes pre‐clinical and clinical literature focused on the cellular characterization of both OECs in vitro and post‐transplantation. We highlight the roles and effects of OECs on (a) the injury‐induced glial milieu, (b) neuronal growth/regeneration, and (c) functional recovery after injury. Due to the shown benefits of OECs with in vitro and animal studies and a limited number of clinical trials, where safety and effectivity were shown, it is necessary to conduct more studies on OECs to obtain effective and feasible treatment methods.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Entering a new era of quantifying glutamate clearance in health and disease</title>

	<description>Abstract
Glutamate transporter proteins, expressed on both neurons and glia, serve as the main gatekeepers that dictate the spatial and temporal actions of extracellular glutamate. Glutamate is essential to the function of the healthy brain yet paradoxically contributes to the toxicity associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Rapid transporter‐mediated glutamate uptake, primarily occurring at astrocytic processes, tightens the efficiency of excitatory network activity and prevents toxic glutamate build‐up in the extracellular space. Glutamate transporter dysfunction is thought to underlie myriad central nervous system (CNS) diseases including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. Over the past few decades, techniques such as biochemical uptake assays and electrophysiological recordings of transporter currents from individual astrocytes have revealed the remarkable ability of the CNS to efficiently clear extracellular glutamate. In more recent years, the rapidly evolving glutamate‐sensing “sniffers” now allow researchers to visualize real‐time glutamate transients on a millisecond time scale with single synapse spatial resolution in defined cell populations. As we transition to an increased reliance on optical‐based methods of glutamate visualization and quantification, it is of utmost importance to understand not only the advantages that glutamate biosensors bring to the table but also the associated caveats and their implications for data interpretation. In this review, we summarize the strengths and limitations of the commonly used methods to quantify glutamate uptake. We then discuss what these techniques, when viewed as a complementary whole, have told us about the brain's ability to regulate glutamate levels, in both health and in the context of neurodegenerative disease.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Three‐dimensional multi‐gene expression maps reveal cell fate changes associated with laterality reversal of zebrafish habenula</title>

	<description>Two‐dimensional (2D) gene expression snapshots cannot properly reflect the volumes, positions, or overlapped domains of multiple genes in tissues that are organized in three‐dimensional (3D) naturally. Novel approach, combing fluorescent antisense mRNA labeling, confocal z‐stack acquisition, and 3D image alignment tool, has uncovered what have been overlooked by 2D images.

Abstract
The conserved bilateral habenular nuclei (HA) in vertebrate diencephalon develop into compartmentalized structures containing neurons derived from different cell lineages. Despite extensive studies demonstrated that zebrafish larval HA display distinct left–right (L‐R) asymmetry in gene expression and connectivity, the spatial gene expression domains were mainly obtained from two‐dimensional (2D) snapshots of colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization staining which could not properly reflect different HA neuronal lineages constructed in three‐dimension (3D). Combing the tyramide‐based fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy and customized imaging processing procedures, we have created spatial distribution maps of four genes for 4‐day‐old zebrafish and in sibling fish whose L‐R asymmetry was spontaneously reversed. 3D volumetric analyses showed that ratios of cpd2, lov, ron, and nrp1a expression in L‐R reversed HA were reversed according to the parapineal positions. However, the quantitative changes of gene expression in reversed larval brains do not mirror the gene expression level in the obverse larval brains. There were a total 87.78% increase in lov+nrp1a+ and a total 12.45% decrease in lov+ron+ double‐positive neurons when the L‐R asymmetry of HA was reversed. Thus, our volumetric analyses of the 3D maps indicate that changes of HA neuronal cell fates are associated with the reversal of HA laterality. These changes likely account for the behavior changes associated with HA laterality alterations.</description>

	<description>Open Practical Laboratories in Neurosciences are outreach activities aimed towards middle schoo students in the Brazilian Amazon, discussing neuroscience topics. The outreach led to immediate benefits on attitudes towards science and scientists, which led to better understanding of the neurosciences.

Abstract
The Open Practical Laboratory in the Neurosciences is an outreach program that seeks to improve the knowledge of the neurosciences by elementary school students and to promote better attitudes in relation to neuroscience, science in general, and scientists. It consists in practical and demonstration activities on the theme of the neurosciences. This outreach strategy was applied in four public schools in a municipality in Southeastern Pará, Brazil characterized by low performance in educational reviews in Brazil. Students from both sexes from 9th grade (last grade before high school) were enrolled in the program. The outreach program improved students’ knowledge about the neurosciences, and promoted better attitudes in relation to science and scientists, in comparison to students who did not go through the activities. Results suggest that scientific outreach strategies can produce results beyond immediate increases in knowledge, promoting better attitudes in relation to science.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sensorimotor dysfunction in a mild mouse model of cortical contusion injury without significant neuronal loss is associated with increases in inflammatory proteins with innate but not adaptive immune functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24766</guid>

	<description>Traumatic contusion to the primary somatosensory and motor cortices is delivered to the exposed left forebrain. Sensorimotor dysfunction is tested every other day for the first week post‐injury (PI) and weekly thereafter up to 8 weeks PI. The impacted cortical area was harvested at 4 hours (h), 12h, 24h, 7 days (d), 14d, and 8 weeks PI and sampled for cytokine and chemokine levels using multiplex electro‐chemiluminescent immunoassays.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Acute trauma to the brain triggers chronic secondary injury mechanisms that contribute to long‐term neurological impairment. We have developed a single, unilateral contusion injury model of sensorimotor dysfunction in adult mice. By targeting a topographically defined neurological circuit with a mild impact, we are able to track sustained behavioral deficits in sensorimotor function in the absence of tissue cavitation or neuronal loss in the contused cortex of these mice. Stereological histopathology and multiplex enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay proteomic screening confirm contusion resulted in chronic gliosis and the robust expression of innate immune cytokines and monocyte attractant chemokines IL‐1β, IL‐5, IL‐6, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL3 in the contused cortex. In contrast, the expression of neuroinflammatory proteins with adaptive immune functions was not significantly modulated by injury. Our data support widespread activation of innate but not adaptive immune responses, confirming an association between sensorimotor dysfunction with innate immune activation in the absence of tissue or neuronal loss in our mice.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Pathogenic missense protein variants affect different functional pathways and proteomic features than healthy population variants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001207</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Laddach, Joseph Chi Fung Ng, Franca Fraternali&lt;/p&gt;

Missense variants are present amongst the healthy population, but some of them are causative of human diseases. A classification of variants associated with “healthy” or “diseased” states is therefore not always straightforward. A deeper understanding of the nature of missense variants in health and disease, the cellular processes they may affect, and the general molecular principles which underlie these differences is essential to offer mechanistic explanations of the true impact of pathogenic variants. Here, we have formalised a statistical framework which enables robust probabilistic quantification of variant enrichment across full-length proteins, their domains, and 3D structure-defined regions. Using this framework, we validate and extend previously reported trends of variant enrichment in different protein structural regions (surface/core/interface). By examining the association of variant enrichment with available functional pathways and transcriptomic and proteomic (protein half-life, thermal stability, abundance) data, we have mined a rich set of molecular features which distinguish between pathogenic and population variants: Pathogenic variants mainly affect proteins involved in cell proliferation and nucleotide processing and are enriched in more abundant proteins. Additionally, rare population variants display features closer to common than pathogenic variants. We validate the association between these molecular features and variant pathogenicity by comparing against existing in silico variant impact annotations. This study provides molecular details into how different proteins exhibit resilience and/or sensitivity towards missense variants and provides the rationale to prioritise variant-enriched proteins and protein domains for therapeutic targeting and development. The ZoomVar database, which we created for this study, is available at fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ZoomVar. It allows users to programmatically annotate missense variants with protein structural information and to calculate variant enrichment in different protein structural regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0DgtYVlHHq4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Phe-Gly motifs drive fibrillization of TDP-43’s prion-like domain condensates</title>

Transactive response DNA-binding Protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) assembles various aggregate forms, including biomolecular condensates or functional and pathological amyloids, with roles in disparate scenarios (e.g., muscle regeneration versus neurodegeneration). The link between condensates and fibrils remains unclear, just as the factors controlling conformational transitions within these aggregate species: Salt- or RNA-induced droplets may evolve into fibrils or remain in the droplet form, suggesting distinct end point species of different aggregation pathways. Using microscopy and NMR methods, we unexpectedly observed in vitro droplet formation in the absence of salts or RNAs and provided visual evidence for fibrillization at the droplet surface/solvent interface but not the droplet interior. Our NMR analyses unambiguously uncovered a distinct amyloid conformation in which Phe-Gly motifs are key elements of the reconstituted fibril form, suggesting a pivotal role for these residues in creating the fibril core. This contrasts the minor participation of Phe-Gly motifs in initiation of the droplet form. Our results point to an intrinsic (i.e., non-induced) aggregation pathway that may exist over a broad range of conditions and illustrate structural features that distinguishes between aggregate forms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qxuZfjMzSJg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The mysterious ecosystem at the ocean’s surface</title>

Life on the ocean’s surface connects worlds. From shallow waters to the deep sea, the open ocean to rivers and lakes, numerous terrestrial and marine species depend on the surface ecosystem and the organisms found therein. Organisms that live freely at the surface, termed “neuston,” include keystone organisms like the golden seaweed &lt;i&gt;Sargassum&lt;/i&gt; that makes up the Sargasso Sea, floating barnacles, snails, nudibranchs, and cnidarians. Many ecologically and economically important fish species live as or rely upon neuston. Species at the surface are not distributed uniformly; the ocean’s surface harbors unique neustonic communities and ecoregions found at only certain latitudes and only in specific ocean basins. But the surface is also on the front line of climate change and pollution. Despite the diversity and importance of the ocean’s surface in connecting disparate habitats, and the risks it faces, we know very little about neustonic life. This Essay will introduce you to the neuston, their connections to diverse habitats, the threats they face, and new opportunities for research and discovery at the air-sea interface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/fSSDTi67MjA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cerebrovascular Neuroprotection after Acute Concussion in Adolescents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26082</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26082?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To assess acute cerebrovascular function in concussed adolescents (14–21 years of age), whether it is related to resting cerebral hemodynamics, and whether it recovers chronically.


Methods
Cerebral vasoreactivity and autoregulation, based on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, was assessed in 28 concussed participants (≤14 days of injury) and 29 matched controls. The participants in the concussion group returned for an 8‐week follow‐up assessment. Over the course of those 8‐weeks, participants recorded aerobic exercise frequency and duration.


Results
Between groups, demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were not significantly different. Vasoreactivity was significantly higher in the concussed group (p = 0.02). Within the concussed group, 60% of the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity was explained by vasoreactivity and two components of autoregulation – falling slope and effectiveness of autoregulation (adjusted R2 = 0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, lower mean arterial pressure, lower responses to increases in arterial pressure, and lower vasoreactivity were significantly associated with larger symptom burden (adjusted R2 = 0.72, p &amp;lt; 0.01). By the 8‐week timepoint, symptom burden, but not vasoreactivity, improved in all but four concussed participants (p &amp;lt; 0.01). 8‐week change in vasoreactivity was positively associated with aerobic exercise volume (adjusted R2 = 0.19, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
Concussion resulted in changes in cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms, which in turn explained the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity and acute symptom burden. Furthermore, these alterations persisted chronically despite symptom resolution, but was positively modified by aerobic exercise volume. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for further investigation into underlying cerebrovascular related symptomatology. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multimodality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable, although neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E–eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α—another key target of regulation—occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Neural Model of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hippocampal Theta Rhythms: Anatomy, Neurophysiology, and Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.665052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.665052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article describes a neural model of the anatomy, neurophysiology, and functions of intrinsic and extrinsic theta rhythms in the brains of multiple species. Topics include how theta rhythms were discovered; how theta rhythms organize brain information processing into temporal series of spatial patterns; how distinct theta rhythms occur within area CA1 of the hippocampus and between the septum and area CA3 of the hippocampus; what functions theta rhythms carry out in different brain regions, notably CA1-supported functions like learning, recognition, and memory that involve visual, cognitive, and emotional processes; how spatial navigation, adaptively timed learning, and category learning interact with hippocampal theta rhythms; how parallel cortical streams through the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) represent the end-points of the What cortical stream for perception and cognition and the Where cortical stream for spatial representation and action; how the neuromodulator acetylcholine interacts with the septo-hippocampal theta rhythm and modulates category learning; what functions are carried out by other brain rhythms, such as gamma and beta oscillations; and how gamma and beta oscillations interact with theta rhythms. Multiple experimental facts about theta rhythms are unified and functionally explained by this theoretical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cross-Whisker Adaptation of Neurons in Layer 2/3 of the Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.646563</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.646563</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the barrel cortex respond preferentially to stimulation of one principal whisker and weakly to several adjacent whiskers. Such integration exists already in layer 4, the pivotal recipient layer of thalamic inputs. Previous studies show that cortical neurons gradually adapt to repeated whisker stimulations and that layer 4 neurons exhibit whisker specific adaptation and no apparent interactions with other whiskers. This study aimed to study the specificity of adaptation of layer 2/3 cortical cells. Towards this aim, we compared the synaptic response of neurons to either repetitive stimulation of one of two responsive whiskers or when repetitive stimulation of the two whiskers was interleaved. We found that in most layer 2/3 cells adaptation is whisker-specific. These findings indicate that despite the multi-whisker receptive fields in the cortex, the adaptation process for each whisker-pathway is mostly independent of other whiskers. A mechanism allowing high responsiveness in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Characteristics of Idiopathic Sensory Processing Disorder in Young Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.647928</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.647928</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study described the developmental and behavioral characteristics of children identified with idiopathic sensory processing disorder (SPD) as well as the relations among specific types of SPD as proposed by the nosology presented by Miller et al. (2007), adaptive behavior profiles, and behaviors associated with mental functioning. A retrospective, non-experimental design applying descriptive and correlational analyses was used. Data were obtained from clinic medical records of 78 children ages 2 to 7 years who were identified with sensory processing problems affecting daily life, but who did not meet criteria for any other neurodevelopmental or mental disorders following a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Results revealed that all SPD types as described by current typologies were well represented with the most common being the over-responsivity sensory modulation subtype. Within the sample, 53% of the children displayed more than one SPD type. Atypical externalizing and internalizing behavior scores associated with various mental disorders as measured by the child behavior checklist (CBCL) fell in the borderline dysfunctional range. Adaptive behavior for all developmental domains was below average, and the severity of SPD symptoms moderately and positively correlated with behaviors associated with mental disorders, and with lower adaptive behavior performance. It was concluded that symptoms characteristic of the various types of idiopathic SPD overlap substantially suggesting that current typologies may include more types/subtypes than are necessary or clinically useful. Children with SPD share similar, but often less severe pathological behaviors associated with other mental or related neurodevelopmental disorders. Psychometrically sound measures of SPD are needed, and further study of the neural mechanisms involved in sensory processing deficits is vital for validating idiopathic SPD as its own diagnostic entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Graphlet-Based Topological Characterization of the Resting-State Network in Healthy People</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665544</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665544</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a graphlet-based topological algorithm for the investigation of the brain network at resting state (RS). To this aim, we model the brain as a graph, where (labeled) nodes correspond to specific cerebral areas and links are weighted connections determined by the intensity of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, we select a number of working graphlets, namely, connected and non-isomorphic induced subgraphs. We compute, for each labeled node, its Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV), which allows us to associate a GDV matrix to each one of the 133 subjects of the considered sample, reporting how many times each node of the atlas “touches” the independent orbits defined by the graphlet set. We focus on the 56 independent columns (i.e., non-redundant orbits) of the GDV matrices. By aggregating their count all over the 133 subjects and then by sorting each column independently, we obtain a sorted node table, whose top-level entries highlight the nodes (i.e., brain regions) most frequently touching each of the 56 independent graphlet orbits. Then, by pairwise comparing the columns of the sorted node table in the top-k entries for various values of k, we identify sets of nodes that are consistently involved with high frequency in the 56 independent graphlet orbits all over the 133 subjects. It turns out that these sets consist of labeled nodes directly belonging to the default mode network (DMN) or strongly interacting with it at the RS, indicating that graphlet analysis provides a viable tool for the topological characterization of such brain regions. We finally provide a validation of the graphlet approach by testing its power in catching network differences. To this aim, we encode in a Graphlet Correlation Matrix (GCM) the network information associated with each subject then construct a subject-to-subject Graphlet Correlation Distance (GCD) matrix based on the Euclidean distances between all possible pairs of GCM. The analysis of the clusters induced by the GCD matrix shows a clear separation of the subjects in two groups, whose relationship with the subject characteristics is investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Glycolytic Metabolism, Brain Resilience, and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.662242</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia. Despite decades of research, the etiology and pathogenesis of AD are not well understood. Brain glucose hypometabolism has long been recognized as a prominent anomaly that occurs in the preclinical stage of AD. Recent studies suggest that glycolytic metabolism, the cytoplasmic pathway of the breakdown of glucose, may play a critical role in the development of AD. Glycolysis is essential for a variety of neural activities in the brain, including energy production, synaptic transmission, and redox homeostasis. Decreased glycolytic flux has been shown to correlate with the severity of amyloid and tau pathology in both preclinical and clinical AD patients. Moreover, increased glucose accumulation found in the brains of AD patients supports the hypothesis that glycolytic deficit may be a contributor to the development of this phenotype. Brain hyperglycemia also provides a plausible explanation for the well-documented link between AD and diabetes. Humans possess three primary variants of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene – ApoE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;ϵ2, ApoE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;ϵ3, and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;ϵ4 – that confer differential susceptibility to AD. Recent findings indicate that neuronal glycolysis is significantly affected by human ApoE isoforms and glycolytic robustness may serve as a major mechanism that renders an ApoE2-bearing brain more resistant against the neurodegenerative risks for AD. In addition to AD, glycolytic dysfunction has been observed in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, strengthening the concept of glycolytic dysfunction as a common pathway leading to neurodegeneration. Taken together, these advances highlight a promising translational opportunity that involves targeting glycolysis to bolster brain metabolic resilience and by such to alter the course of brain aging or disease development to prevent or reduce the risks for not only AD but also other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Microbial Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Assessment of Microorganisms' Implications in the Neurodegenerative Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microbial infections have been linked to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to synthesise and assess global evidence of microbial pathogenesis and pathophysiology in AD (MPP-AD) and associated neurodegenerative conditions using integrated science mapping and content analytics to explore the associated research landscape. Relevant MPP-AD documents were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus according to PRISMA principles and analysed for productivity/trend linked to authors/countries, thematic conceptual framework, and international collaborative networks. A total of 258 documents published from 136 sources to 39.42 average citations/document were obtained on MPP-AD. The co-authors per document were 7.6, and the collaboration index was 5.71. The annual research outputs increased tremendously in the last 6 years from 2014 to 2019, accounting for 66% compared with records in the early years from 1982 to 1990 (16%). The USA (n = 71, freq. = 30.34%), United Kingdom (n = 32, freq. = 13.68%) and China (n = 27, 11.54%) ranked in first three positions in term of country's productivity. Four major international collaboration clusters were found in MPP-AD research. The country collaboration network in MPP-AD was characteristic of sparse interaction and acquaintanceship (density = 0.11, diameter = 4). Overall, international collaboration is globally inadequate [centralisation statistics: degree (40.5%), closeness (4%), betweenness (23%), and eigenvector (76.7%)] against the robust authors' collaboration index of 5.71 in MPP-AD research. Furthermore, four conceptual thematic frameworks (CTF) namely, CTF#1, roles of microbial/microbiome infection and dysbiosis in cognitive dysfunctions; CTF#2, bacterial infection specific roles in dementia; CTF#3, the use of yeast as a model system for studying MPP-AD and remediation therapy; and CFT#4, flow cytometry elucidation of amyloid-beta and aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Finally, aetiology-based mechanisms of MPP-AD, namely, gut microbiota, bacterial infection, and viral infection, were comprehensively discussed. This study provides an overview of MPP-AD and serves as a stepping stone for future preparedness in MPP-AD-related research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Neural Tracking of Sound Rhythms Correlates With Diagnosis, Severity, and Prognosis of Disorders of Consciousness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Effective diagnosis and prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) provides a basis for family counseling, decision-making, and the design of rehabilitation programs. However, effective and objective bedside evaluation is a challenging problem. In this study, we explored electroencephalography (EEG) response tracking sound rhythms as potential neural markers for DOC evaluation. We analyzed the responses to natural speech and tones modulated at 2 and 41 Hz. At the population level, patients with positive outcomes (DOC-P) showed higher cortical synchronization to modulated tones at 41 Hz compared with patients with negative outcomes (DOC-N). At the individual level, phase coherence to modulated tones at 41 Hz was significantly correlated with Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) scores. Furthermore, SVM classifiers, trained using phase coherences in higher frequency bands or combination of the low frequency aSSR and speech tracking responses, performed very well in diagnosis and prognosis of DOC. These findings show that EEG response to auditory rhythms is a potential tool for diagnosis, severity, and prognosis of DOC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Re-experiencing Symptoms Between Husbands and Wives Who Lost Their Only Child in China: A Resting-State Functional Connectivity Study of Hippocampal Subfields</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655044</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655044</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Losing one’s only child may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), of which re-experiencing is the core symptom. However, neuroimaging studies of sex differences in re-experiencing in the context of the trauma of losing one’s only child and PTSD are scarce; comparisons of the functional networks from the hippocampal subfields to the thalamus might clarify the neural basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty couples without any psychiatric disorder who lost their only child (non-PTSD group), 55 patients with PTSD, and 50 normal controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The functional connectivity (FC) from the hippocampal subregions to the thalamus and the correlations of FC with re-experiencing symptoms were analyzed within and between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with husbands without PTSD, wives without PTSD had higher re-experiencing symptoms and weaker FC between the right hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (RCA3) and the right thalamus (RT; RCA3-RT). Moreover, only the correlation between the RCA3-RT FC and re-experiencing in wives without PTSD was significant. Among the three groups, only the RCA3-RT FC in female subjects was markedly different. Additionally, the RCA3-RT FC in wives without PTSD was remarkably lower relative to female patients with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Wives without PTSD who lost their only child had worse re-experiencing symptoms relative to their husbands, which was associated with the FC alteration between the hippocampal subregions and the thalamus. Importantly, the low level of the RCA3-RT FC may play a potentially protective role against the development of PTSD in wives who have lost their only child.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Negative Effects of Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency on Spontaneous Brain Microstates: Evidence From Resting-State EEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636504</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636504</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of mobile phone addiction (MPA) has increased rapidly in recent years, and it has had a certain negative impact on emotions (e.g., anxiety and depression) and cognitive capacities (e.g., executive control and working memory). At the level of neural circuits, the continued increase in activity in the brain regions associated with addiction leads to neural adaptations and structural changes. At present, the spontaneous brain microstates that could be negatively influenced by MPA are unclear. In this study, the temporal characteristics of four resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4) related to mobile phone addiction tendency (MPAT) were investigated using the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS). We attempted to analyze the correlation between MPAT and corresponding microstates and provide evidence to explain the brain and behavioral changes caused by MPA. The results showed that the total score of the MPATS was positively correlated with the duration of MS1, related to phonological processing and negatively correlated with the duration of MS2, related to visual or imagery processing, and MS4, related to the attentional network; the score of the withdrawal symptoms subscale was additionally associated with duration of MS3, related to the cingulo-opercular emotional network. Based on these results, we believe that MPAT may have some negative effects on attentional networks and sensory brain networks; moreover, withdrawal symptoms may induce some negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aims to decode the hemodynamic responses (HRs) evoked by multiple sound-categories using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The six different sounds were given as stimuli (English, non-English, annoying, nature, music, and gunshot). The oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) concentration changes are measured in both hemispheres of the auditory cortex while 18 healthy subjects listen to 10-s blocks of six sound-categories. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks were used as a classifier. The classification accuracy was 20.38 ± 4.63% with six class classification. Though LSTM networks’ performance was a little higher than chance levels, it is noteworthy that we could classify the data subject-wise without feature selections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Perceptual Asymmetries and Auditory Processing of Estonian Quantities</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also has a clearly described “pop-out” effect, where an element with some extra feature is easier to detect among elements without an extra feature. This phenomenon is better known as auditory perceptual asymmetry. We investigated such asymmetry between shorter or longer duration, and level or falling of pitch of linguistic stimuli that carry a meaning in one language (Estonian), but not in another (Russian). For the mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment, we created four different types of stimuli by modifying the duration of the first vowel [ɑ] (170, 290 ms) and pitch contour (level vs. falling pitch) of the stimuli words (‘SATA,’ ‘SAKI’). The stimuli were synthesized from Estonian words (‘SATA,’ ‘SAKI’) and follow the Estonian language three-way quantity system, which incorporates tonal features (falling pitch contour) together with temporal patterns. This made the meaning of the word dependent on the combination of both features and allows us to compare the relative contribution of duration and pitch contour in discrimination of language stimuli in the brain via MMN generation. The participants of the experiment were 12 Russian native speakers with little or no experience in Estonian and living in Estonia short-term, and 12 Estonian native speakers (age 18–27 years). We found that participants’ perception of the linguistic stimuli differed not only according to the physical features but also according to their native language, confirming that the meaning of the word interferes with the early automatic processing of phonological features. The GAMM and ANOVA analysis of the reversed design results showed that the deviant with longer duration among shorter standards elicited a MMN response with greater amplitude than the short deviant among long standards, while changes in pitch contour (falling vs. level pitch) produced neither strong MMN nor asymmetry. Thus, we demonstrate the effect of language background on asymmetric perception of linguistic stimuli that aligns with those of previous studies (Jaramillo et al., 2000), and contributes to the growing body of knowledge supporting auditory perceptual asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study explored whether acupuncture affects the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the acquisition of motor skills following repetitive sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT) training.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-six participants were recruited. The changes in the aftereffects induced by intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and followed acupuncture were tested by the amplitude motor evoked potential (MEP) at pre-and-post-iTBS for 30 min and at acupuncture-in and -off for 30 min. Secondly, the effects of acupuncture on SVIPT movement in inducing error rate and learning skill index were tested.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Following one session of iTBS, the MEP amplitude was increased and maintained at a high level for 30 min. The facilitation of MEP was gradually decreased to the baseline level during acupuncture-in and did not return to a high level after needle extraction. The SVIPT-acupuncture group had a lower learning skill index than those in the SVIPT group, indicating that acupuncture intervention after SVIPT training may restrain the acquisition ability of one’s learning skills.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture could reverse the LTP-like plasticity of the contralateral motor cortex induced by iTBS. Subsequent acupuncture may negatively affect the efficacy of the acquisition of learned skills in repetitive exercise training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Transient Inactivation of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Ventral Hippocampus Impairs Active Place Avoidance Retrieval on a Rotating Arena</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that communication between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is critical for various cognitive and behavioral functions. However, the exact role of these structures in spatial coordination remains to be clarified. Here we sought to determine the involvement of the mPFC and the vHPC in the spatial retrieval of a previously learned active place avoidance task in adult male Long-Evans rats, using a combination of unilateral and bilateral local muscimol inactivations. Moreover, we tested the role of the vHPC-mPFC pathway by performing combined ipsilateral and contralateral inactivations. Our results showed not only bilateral inactivations of either structure, but also the combined inactivations impaired the retrieval of spatial memory, whereas unilateral one-structure inactivations did not yield any effect. Remarkably, muscimol injections in combined groups exerted similar deficits, regardless of whether the inactivations were contralateral or ipsilateral. These findings confirm the importance of these structures in spatial cognition and emphasize the importance of the intact functioning of the vHPC-mPFC pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Long-Term Consequence of Non-neurotropic H3N2 Influenza A Virus Infection for the Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease Symptoms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses until today are a leading cause of worldwide severe pandemics and represent a major threat to human and animal health. Although the primary target of influenza viruses is the lung, infection may manifest with acute and even chronic neurological complications (e.g., status epilepticus, encephalopathies, and encephalitis) potentially increasing the long-term risk for neurodegenerative diseases. We previously described that a peripheral influenza A virus (IAV) infection caused by non-neurotropic H3N2 (maHK68) variant leads to long-term neuroinflammation and synapse loss together with impaired memory formation in young adult mice. Processes of neuroinflammation have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and prolonged or excessive innate immune responses are considered a risk factor for AD. Here, the role of purely peripheral IAV infection for the development and progression of AD in a transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1) was investigated. At 2 months of age, mice were infected with H3N2 IAV and the detailed analysis of microglia morphology revealed neuroinflammation in the hippocampus already of 6 months old non-infected APP/PS1 mice together with impaired spatial learning, however, microglia activation, amyloid-β plaques load and cognitive impairments were even more pronounced in APP/PS1 mice upon H3N2 infection. Moreover, CA1 hippocampal dendritic spine density was reduced even at 120 dpi compared to wild-type and also to non-infected APP/PS1 mice, whereas neuronal cells number was not altered. These findings demonstrate that non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV infection as a peripheral immune stimulation may exacerbate AD symptoms possibly by triggering microglial hyperactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Functional Characterization of Sex Pheromone Neurons and Receptors in the Armyworm, Mythimna separata (Walker)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pheromone receptors (PRs) of moths are expressed on the dendritic membrane of odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in the long trichoid sensilla (TS) of antennae and are essential to sex pheromone reception. The function of peripheral neurons of Mythimna separata in recognizing sex pheromones is still unclear. In this study, electroantennogram recordings were performed from male and female antennae of M. separata, and showed that the major component of sex pheromones, (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11–16:Ald), evoked the strongest response of male antennae with significant differences between sexes. Single sensillum recording was used to record responses of neurons housed in TS of male M. separata. The results revealed four types of TS with three neurons housed in each type, based on profiles of responses to sex pheromone components and pheromone analogs. ORN-B of type-I TS was specifically tuned to the major sex pheromone component Z11–16:Ald; ORN-Bs in type-III and type-IV TSs were, respectively, activated by minor components (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-yl acetate (Z11–16:OAc) and hexadecenal (16:Ald); and ORNs in type-II TS were mainly activated by the sex pheromone analogs. We further cloned full-length sequences of six putative PR genes and an Orco gene. Functional characterization of PRs in the Xenopus oocyte system demonstrated that male antennae-biased MsepPR1 responded strongly to (Z)-9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Ald), suggesting that MsepPR1 may be expressed in type-II TS. MsepPR6 was exclusively tuned to (Z)-9-tetradecen-1-yl acetate (Z9–14:OAc). MsepPR2 and MsepPR4 showed no responses to any tested components. Female antennae-biased MespPR5 was broadly tuned to Z9–14:Ald, Z9–14:OAc, Z11–16:Ald, and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol (Z11–16:OH). Our results further enriched the sex pheromone recognition mechanism in the peripheral nervous system of moth M. separata.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: TRPM4 Expression During Postnatal Developmental of Mouse CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.643287</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;TRPM4 is a non-selective cation channel activated by intracellular calcium and permeable to monovalent cations. This channel participates in the control of neuronal firing, neuronal plasticity, and neuronal death. TRPM4 depolarizes dendritic spines and is critical for the induction of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Despite its functional importance, no subcellular localization or expression during postnatal development has been described in this area. To examine the localization and expression of TRPM4, we performed duplex immunofluorescence and patch-clamp in brain slices at different postnatal ages in C57BL/6J mice. At P0 we found TRPM4 is expressed with a somatic pattern. At P7, P14, and P35, TRPM4 expression extended from the soma to the apical dendrites but was excluded from the axon initial segment. Patch-clamp recordings showed a TRPM4-like current active at the resting membrane potential from P0, which increased throughout the postnatal development. This current was dependent on intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;) and sensitive to 9-phenanthrol (9-Ph). Inhibiting TRPM4 with 9-Ph hyperpolarized the membrane potential at P14 and P35, with no effect in earlier stages. Together, these results show that TRPM4 is expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the soma and apical dendrites and associated with a TRPM4-like current, which depolarizes the neurons. The expression, localization, and function of TRPM4 throughout postnatal development in the CA1 hippocampal may underlie an important mechanism of control of membrane potential and action potential firing during critical periods of neuronal development, particularly during the establishment of circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effective Connectivity During Rest and Music Listening: An EEG Study on Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657221</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Music-based interventions seem to enhance motor, sensory and cognitive functions in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the underlying action mechanisms are still largely unknown. This electroencephalography (EEG) study aimed to investigate the effective connectivity patterns characterizing PD in the resting state and during music listening. EEG recordings were obtained from fourteen non-demented PD patients and 12 healthy controls, at rest and while listening to three music tracks. Theta- and alpha-band power spectral density and multivariate partial directed coherence were computed. Power and connectivity measures were compared between patients and controls in the four conditions and in music vs. rest. Compared to controls, patients showed enhanced theta-band power and slightly enhanced alpha-band power, but markedly reduced theta- and alpha-band interactions among EEG channels, especially concerning the information received by the right central channel. EEG power differences were partially reduced by music listening, which induced power increases in controls but not in patients. Connectivity differences were slightly compensated by music, whose effects largely depended on the track. In PD, music enhanced the frontotemporal inter-hemispheric communication. Our findings suggest that PD is characterized by enhanced activity but reduced information flow within the EEG network, being only partially normalized by music. Nevertheless, music capability to facilitate inter-hemispheric communication might underlie its beneficial effects on PD pathophysiology and should be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Potential Role of Protein Kinase R as a Regulator of Age-Related Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638208</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a growing evidence describing a decline in adaptive homeostasis in aging-related diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), many of which are characterized by the appearance of non-native protein aggregates. One signaling pathway that allows cell adaptation is the integrated stress response (ISR), which senses stress stimuli through four kinases. ISR activation promotes translational arrest through the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and the induction of a gene expression program to restore cellular homeostasis. However, depending on the stimulus, ISR can also induce cell death. One of the ISR sensors is the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase R (PKR)], initially described as a viral infection sensor, and now a growing evidence supports a role for PKR on CNS physiology. PKR has been largely involved in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathological process. Here, we reviewed the antecedents supporting the role of PKR on the efficiency of synaptic transmission and cognition. Then, we review PKR’s contribution to AD and discuss the possible participation of PKR as a player in the neurodegenerative process involved in aging-related pathologies affecting the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Behind the scenes: Are latent memories supported by calcium independent plasticity?</title>

	<description>Abstract
N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) can be considered to be the de facto “plasticity” receptors in the brain due to their central role in the activity‐dependent modification of neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission. Since the 1980s, research on NMDARs has focused on the second messenger properties of calcium and the downstream signaling pathways that mediate alterations in neural form and function. Recently, NMDARs were shown to drive activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity without calcium influx. How this “nonionotropic” plasticity occurs in vitro is becoming clearer, but research on its involvement in behavior and cognition is in its infancy. There is a partial overlap in the downstream signaling molecules that are involved in ionotropic and nonionotropic NMDAR‐dependent plasticity. Given this, and prior studies of the cognitive impacts of ionotropic NMDAR plasticity, a preliminary model explaining how NMDAR nonionotropic plasticity affects learning and memory can be established. We hypothesize that nonionotropic NMDAR plasticity takes part in latent memory encoding in immature rodents through nonassociative depression of synaptic efficacy, and possibly shrinking of dendritic spines. Further, the late postnatal alteration in NMDAR composition in the hippocampus appears to reduce nonionotropic signaling and remove a restriction on memory retrieval. This framework substantially alters the canonical model of NMDAR involvement in spatial cognition and hippocampal maturation and provides novel and exciting inroads for future studies.</description>

An important model system for understanding genes, neurons and behavior, the nematode worm &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; naturally moves through a variety of complex postures, for which estimation from video data is challenging. We introduce an open-source Python package, WormPose, for 2D pose estimation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;, including self-occluded, coiled shapes. We leverage advances in machine vision afforded from convolutional neural networks and introduce a synthetic yet realistic generative model for images of worm posture, thus avoiding the need for human-labeled training. WormPose is effective and adaptable for imaging conditions across worm tracking efforts. We quantify pose estimation using synthetic data as well as N2 and mutant worms in on-food conditions. We further demonstrate WormPose by analyzing long (∼ 8 hour), fast-sampled (∼ 30 Hz) recordings of on-food N2 worms to provide a posture-scale analysis of roaming/dwelling behaviors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7FfoBN84TIc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

MgtE is a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel conserved in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, including humans, and plays an important role in Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. The previously determined MgtE structures in the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound, closed-state, and structure-based functional analyses of MgtE revealed that the binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to the MgtE cytoplasmic domain induces channel inactivation to maintain Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. There are no structures of the transmembrane (TM) domain for MgtE in Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free conditions, and the pore-opening mechanism has thus remained unclear.
Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the MgtE-Fab complex in the absence of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free MgtE TM domain structure and its comparison with the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound, closed-state structure, together with functional analyses, showed the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent pore opening of MgtE on the cytoplasmic side and revealed the kink motions of the TM2 and TM5 helices at the glycine residues, which are important for channel activity. Overall, our work provides structure-based mechanistic insights into the channel gating of MgtE.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/v-tah9CPryg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: HMGCR inhibition stabilizes the glycolytic enzyme PKM2 to support the growth of renal cell carcinoma</title>

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is responsible for most cases of the kidney cancer. Previous research showed that low serum levels of cholesterol level positively correlate with poorer RCC-specific survival outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms and functional significance of the role of cholesterol in the development of RCC remain obscure. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) plays a pivotal role in RCC development as it is the key rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of HMGCR could accelerate the development of RCC tumors by lactate accumulation and angiogenesis in animal models. We identified that the inhibition of HMGCR led to an increase in glycolysis via the regulated HSP90 expression levels, thus maintaining the levels of a glycolysis rate-limiting enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Based on these findings, we reversed the HMGCR inhibition-induced tumor growth acceleration in RCC xenograft mice by suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the coadministration of Shikonin, a potent PKM2 inhibitor, reverted the tumor development induced by the HMGCR signaling pathway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DQBtRZniGSI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astronauts experience post-flight disturbances in postural and locomotor control due to sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight. These alterations may have adverse consequences if a rapid egress is required after landing. Although current exercise protocols can effectively mitigate cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning, the benefits to post-flight sensorimotor dysfunction are limited. Furthermore, some exercise capabilities like treadmill running are currently not feasible on exploration spaceflight vehicles. Thus, new in-flight operational countermeasures are needed to mitigate postural and locomotor control deficits after exploration missions. Data from spaceflight and from analog studies collectively suggest that body unloading decreases the utilization of proprioceptive input, and this adaptation strongly contributes to balance dysfunction after spaceflight. For example, on return to Earth, an astronaut’s vestibular input may be compromised by adaptation to microgravity, but their proprioceptive input is compromised by body unloading. Since proprioceptive and tactile input are important for maintaining postural control, keeping these systems tuned to respond to upright balance challenges during flight may improve functional task performance after flight through dynamic reweighting of sensory input. Novel approaches are needed to compensate for the challenges of balance training in microgravity and must be tested in a body unloading environment such as head down bed rest. Here, we review insights from the literature and provide observations from our laboratory that could inform the development of an in-flight proprioceptive countermeasure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Unbiased Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics of Cells Expressing Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Mutations in CCNF Reveals Activation of the Apoptosis Pathway: A Workflow to Screen Pathogenic Gene Mutations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has seen a rapid acceleration in the discovery of new genetic causes of ALS, with more than 20 putative ALS-causing genes now cited. These genes encode proteins that cover a diverse range of molecular functions, including free radical scavenging (e.g., SOD1), regulation of RNA homeostasis (e.g., TDP-43 and FUS), and protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (e.g., ubiquilin-2 and cyclin F) and autophagy (TBK1 and sequestosome-1/p62). It is likely that the various initial triggers of disease (either genetic, environmental and/or gene-environment interaction) must converge upon a common set of molecular pathways that underlie ALS pathogenesis. Given the complexity, it is not surprising that a catalog of molecular pathways and proteostasis dysfunctions have been linked to ALS. One of the challenges in ALS research is determining, at the early stage of discovery, whether a new gene mutation is indeed disease-specific, and if it is linked to signaling pathways that trigger neuronal cell death. We have established a proof-of-concept proteogenomic workflow to assess new gene mutations, using CCNF (cyclin F) as an example, in cell culture models to screen whether potential gene candidates fit the criteria of activating apoptosis. This can provide an informative and time-efficient output that can be extended further for validation in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models and/or for mechanistic studies. As a proof-of-concept, we expressed cyclin F mutations (K97R, S195R, S509P, R574Q, S621G) in HEK293 cells for label-free quantitative proteomics that bioinformatically predicted activation of the neuronal cell death pathways, which was validated by immunoblot analysis. Proteomic analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patient fibroblasts bearing the S621G mutation showed the same activation of these pathways providing compelling evidence for these candidate gene mutations to be strong candidates for further validation and mechanistic studies (such as E3 enzymatic activity assays, protein–protein and protein–substrate studies, and neuronal apoptosis and aberrant branching measurements in zebrafish). Our proteogenomics approach has great utility and provides a relatively high-throughput screening platform to explore candidate gene mutations for their propensity to cause neuronal cell death, which will guide a researcher for further experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuronal and Glial Distribution of Tau Protein in the Adult Rat and Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.607303</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a microtubule-associated protein for which the physiological functions remain a topic of vigorous investigation. Additionally, tau is a central player in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and several frontotemporal dementias. A critical variable to understanding tau in physiological and disease contexts is its normal localization within cells of the adult CNS. Tau is often described as an axon-specific (or enriched) and neuron-specific protein with little to no expression in glial cells, all of which are untrue. Understanding normal tau distribution also impacts interpretation of experimental results and hypotheses regarding its role in disease. Thus, we set out to help clarify the normal localization of tau in the adult CNS of middle-aged rats and rhesus macaque using the hippocampus as a representative brain structure. The physiological concentration of tau in the rat hippocampus was 6.6 μM and in white matter was 3.6 μM as determined by quantitative sandwich ELISAs. We evaluated the cellular localization of tau using multiple tau-specific antibodies with epitopes to different regions, including Tau1, Tau5, Tau7, R1, and two novel primate-specific antibodies NT9 and NT15. In the rat and monkey, tau was localized within the somatodendritic and axonal compartments, as well as a subset of neuronal nuclei. Semi-quantitative fluorescence intensity measurements revealed that depending on the specific reagent used the somatodendritic tau is relatively equal to, higher than, or lower than axonal tau, highlighting differential labeling of tau with various antibodies despite its distribution throughout the neuron. Tau was strongly expressed in mature oligodendrocytes and displayed little to no expression in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, astrocytes or microglia. Collectively, the data indicate tau is ∼3 – 7 μM under physiological conditions, is not specifically enriched in axons, and is normally found in both neurons and mature oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS. The full landscape of tau distribution is not revealed by all antibodies suggesting availability of the epitopes is different within specific neuronal compartments. These findings set the stage for better understanding normal tau distributions and interpreting data regarding the presence of tau in different compartments or cell types within disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Comparing the Clinical and Neuropsychological Characteristics of Parkinson’s Disease With and Without Freezing of Gait</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most common walking problems in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Impaired cognitive function is believed to play an important role in developing and aggravating FOG in PD. But some evidence suggests that motor function discrepancy may affect testing results. Therefore, we think it is necessary for PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients to complete neuropsychological tests under similar motor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study recruited 44 idiopathic PD patients [PD-FOG(+) n = 22, PD-FOG(−) n = 22] and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC). PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients were matched for age, year of education, and Hoehn and Yahr score (H&amp;amp;Y). All participants underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological assessment, and demographical and clinical information was also collected.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PD patients showed poorer cognitive function, higher risks of depression and anxiety, and more neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with HC. When controlling for age, years of education, and H&amp;amp;Y, there were no statistical differences in cognitive function between PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients. But PD-FOG(+) patients had worse motor and non-motor symptoms than PD-FOG(−) patients. PD patients whose motor symptoms initiated with rigidity and initiated unilaterally were more likely to experience FOG.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Traditional neuropsychological testing may not be sensitive enough to detect cognitive impairment in PD. Motor symptoms initiated with rigidity and initiated unilaterally might be an important predictor of FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the function of the primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to play a critical role in motor dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Detailed information regarding the specific aspects of M1 circuits that become abnormal is lacking. We recorded single units and local field potentials (LFPs) of M1 neurons in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rats and control rats to assess the impact of dopamine (DA) cell loss during rest and a forelimb reaching task. Our results indicated that M1 neurons can be classified into two groups (putative pyramidal neurons and putative interneurons) and that 6-OHDA could modify the activity of different M1 subpopulations to a large extent. Reduced activation of putative pyramidal neurons during inattentive rest and reaching was observed. In addition, 6-OHDA intoxication was associated with an increase in certain LFP frequencies, especially those in the beta range (broadly defined here as any frequency between 12 and 35 Hz), which become pathologically exaggerated throughout cortico-basal ganglia circuits after dopamine depletion. Furthermore, assessment of different spike-LFP coupling parameters revealed that the putative pyramidal neurons were particularly prone to being phase-locked to ongoing cortical oscillations at 12–35 Hz during reaching. Conversely, putative interneurons were neither hypoactive nor synchronized to ongoing cortical oscillations. These data collectively demonstrate a neuron type-selective alteration in the M1 in hemiparkinsonian rats. These alterations hamper the ability of the M1 to contribute to motor conduction and are likely some of the main contributors to motor impairments in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prognostic Factors and Models for Changes in Cognitive Performance After Multi-Domain Cognitive Training in Healthy Older Adults: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636355</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636355</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cognitive Training (CT) may contribute to the maintenance and even enhancement of cognitive functions in healthy older adults. However, the question who benefits most from multi-domain CTs is still highly under-investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The goal is to investigate prognostic factors and models for changes in cognitive test performance in healthy older adults after a multi-domain CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The data bases MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CENTRAL, and PsycInfo were searched up to July 2019. Studies investigating prognostic factors and/or models on cognitive outcomes (global cognition, memory, attention, executive functions, language, visuo-spatial abilities) after conducting a multi-domain CT in healthy older adults were included. Risk of Bias was assessed using the QUIPS and the PROBAST tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: 23 prognostic factor and model studies were included. Results indicate a high heterogeneity regarding the conducted multi-domain CTs, the investigated prognostic factors, the investigated outcomes, and the used statistical approaches. Age and neuropsychological performance at study entry were the most investigated predictors, yet they show inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Data on prognostic factors and models of changes after multi-domain CT are still too rare and inconsistent to draw clear conclusions due to statistical shortcomings and low reporting quality. Approaches for future research are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, ID: CRD42020147531&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Phonological Variations Are Compensated at the Lexical Level: Evidence From Auditory Neural Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622904</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622904</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dealing with phonological variations is important for speech processing. This article addresses whether phonological variations introduced by assimilatory processes are compensated for at the pre-lexical or lexical level, and whether the nature of variation and the phonological context influence this process. To this end, Swedish nasal regressive place assimilation was investigated using the mismatch negativity (MMN) component. In nasal regressive assimilation, the coronal nasal assimilates to the place of articulation of a following segment, most clearly with a velar or labial place of articulation, as in utan mej “without me” &amp;gt; [ʉːtam mɛjː]. In a passive auditory oddball paradigm, 15 Swedish speakers were presented with Swedish phrases with attested and unattested phonological variations and contexts for nasal assimilation. Attested variations – a coronal-to-labial change as in utan “without” &amp;gt; [ʉːtam] – were contrasted with unattested variations – a labial-to-coronal change as in utom “except” &amp;gt; &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;[ʉːtɔn] – in appropriate and inappropriate contexts created by mej “me” [mɛjː] and dej “you” [dɛjː]. Given that the MMN amplitude depends on the degree of variation between two stimuli, the MMN responses were expected to indicate to what extent the distance between variants was tolerated by the perceptual system. Since the MMN response reflects not only low-level acoustic processing but also higher-level linguistic processes, the results were predicted to indicate whether listeners process assimilation at the pre-lexical and lexical levels. The results indicated no significant interactions across variations, suggesting that variations in phonological forms do not incur any cost in lexical retrieval; hence such variation is compensated for at the lexical level. However, since the MMN response reached significance only for a labial-to-coronal change in a labial context and for a coronal-to-labial change in a coronal context, the compensation might have been influenced by the nature of variation and the phonological context. It is therefore concluded that while assimilation is compensated for at the lexical level, there is also some influence from pre-lexical processing. The present results reveal not only signal-based perception of phonological units, but also higher-level lexical processing, and are thus able to reconcile the bottom-up and top-down models of speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Large Acid-Evoked Currents, Mediated by ASIC1a, Accompany Differentiation in Human Dopaminergic Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668008</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. They contribute to synaptic transmission, neuronal differentiation and neurodegeneration. ASICs have been mainly characterized in neurons from mice or rats and our knowledge of their properties in human neurons is scarce. Here, we functionally characterized ASICs in differentiating LUHMES cells, a human mesencephalic cell line with characteristics of dopaminergic neurons. We find that LUHMES cells express functional ASICs, predominantly homomeric ASIC1a. Expression starts early during differentiation with a striking surge in current amplitude at days 4–6 of differentiation, a time point where—based on published data—LUHMES cells start expressing synaptic markers. Peak ASIC expression therefore coincides with a critical period of LUHMES cell differentiation. It was associated with increased excitability, but not paralleled by an increase in ASIC1 mRNA or protein. In differentiating as well as in terminally differentiated LUHMES cells, ASIC activation by slight acidification elicited large currents, action potentials and a rise in cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Applying the ASIC pore blocker diminazene during differentiation reduced the length of neurites, consistent with the hypothesis that ASICs play a critical role in LUHMES cell differentiation. In summary, our study establishes LUHMES cells as a valuable model to study the role of ASICs for neuronal differentiation and potentially also cell death in a human cell line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: npc2-Deficient Zebrafish Reproduce Neurological and Inflammatory Symptoms of Niemann-Pick Type C Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647860</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647860</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is caused by a mutation of the NPC1 or NPC2 gene, in which un-esterified cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen, and brain. Abnormal lysosomal storage leads to cell damage, neurological problems, and premature death. The time of onset and severity of symptoms of NPC disease are highly variable. The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for NPC disease pathology are far from being understood. The present study generated and characterized a zebrafish mutant that lacks Npc2 protein that may be useful for studies at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels and both small-scale and high-throughput screens. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the zebrafish homolog of NPC2. Five-day-old npc2 mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wildtype larvae. We found that live npc2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; larvae exhibited stronger Nile blue staining. The npc2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; larvae exhibited low mobility and a high anxiety-related response. These behavioral changes correlated with downregulation of the mcu (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) gene, ppp3ca (calcineurin) gene, and genes that are involved in myelination (mbp and mpz). Histological analysis of adult npc2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; zebrafish revealed that pathological changes in the nervous system, kidney, liver, and pancreas correlated with inflammatory responses (i.e., the upregulation of il1, nfκβ, and mpeg; i.e., hallmarks of NPC disease). These findings suggest that the npc2 mutant zebrafish may be a model of NPC disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Visual Deprivation Retards the Maturation of Dendritic Fields and Receptive Fields of Mouse Retinal Ganglion Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640421</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640421</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was well documented that both the size of the dendritic field and receptive field of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are developmentally regulated in the mammalian retina, and visual stimulation is required for the maturation of the dendritic and receptive fields of mouse RGCs. However, it is not clear whether the developmental changes of the RGC receptive field correlate with the dendritic field and whether visual stimulation regulates the maturation of the dendritic field and receptive field of RGCs in a correlated manner. The present work demonstrated that both the dendritic and receptive fields of RGCs continuously develop after eye opening. However, the correlation between the developmental changes in the receptive field size and the dendritic field varies among different RGC types. These results suggest a continuous change of synaptic converging of RGC synaptic inputs in an RGC type-dependent manner. Besides, light deprivation impairs both the development of dendritic and receptive fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of CSF Neurogranin and APOE ε4 on Cognition and Neuropathology in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of neurogranin (Ng) have emerged as a promising biomarker for cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is by far the most consistent genetic risk factor for AD. However, it is not known whether the pathophysiological roles of Ng in MCI or AD are related to APOEε4. We stratified 250 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN) ε4 negative (CN ε4−), CN ε4 positive (CN ε4+), MCI ε4 negative (MCI ε4−), MCI ε4 positive (MCI ε4+), AD ε4 negative (AD ε4−), and AD ε4 positive (AD ε4+). CSF Ng levels were significantly increased in APOE ε4 carriers compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI. In addition, CSF Ng identified MCI ε4+ versus CN ε4−, but not MCI ε4− versus CN ε4−. Similarly, CSF Ng negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at baseline in the MCI ε4+ group. Our findings support the use of CSF Ng as a biomarker of synaptic pathology for AD. We propose that the roles of CSF Ng in the pathophysiology of MCI may be related to APOE ε4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive and Structural Correlates of Conversational Speech Timing in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease: Relevance for Early Detection Approaches</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637404</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637404</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Increasing efforts have focused on the establishment of novel biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-to-AD conversion. Behavioral changes over the course of healthy ageing, at disease onset and during disease progression, have been recently put forward as promising markers for the detection of MCI and AD. The present study examines whether the temporal characteristics of speech in a collaborative referencing task are associated with cognitive function and the volumes of brain regions involved in speech production and known to be reduced in MCI and AD pathology. We then explore the discriminative ability of the temporal speech measures for the classification of MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Individuals with MCI, mild-to-moderate AD and healthy controls (HCs) underwent a structural MRI scan and a battery of neuropsychological tests. They also engaged in a collaborative referencing task with a caregiver. The associations between the conversational speech timing features, cognitive function (domain-specific) and regional brain volumes were examined by means of linear mixed-effect modeling. Genetic programming was used to explore the discriminative ability of the conversational speech features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCI and mild-to-moderate AD are characterized by a general slowness of speech, attributed to slower speech rate and slower turn-taking in conversational settings. The speech characteristics appear to be reflective of episodic, lexico-semantic, executive functioning and visuospatial deficits and underlying volume reductions in frontal, temporal and cerebellar areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The implementation of conversational speech timing-based technologies in clinical and community settings may provide additional markers for the early detection of cognitive deficits and structural changes associated with MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Comparing Pre-trained and Feature-Based Models for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Research related to the automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional diagnostic methods. Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing, and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. There has been a recent proliferation of classification models for AD, but these vary in the datasets used, model types and training and testing paradigms. In this study, we compare and contrast the performance of two common approaches for automatic AD detection from speech on the same, well-matched dataset, to determine the advantages of using domain knowledge vs. pre-trained transfer models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Audio recordings and corresponding manually-transcribed speech transcripts of a picture description task administered to 156 demographically matched older adults, 78 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 78 cognitively intact (healthy) were classified using machine learning and natural language processing as “AD” or “non-AD.” The audio was acoustically-enhanced, and post-processed to improve quality of the speech recording as well control for variation caused by recording conditions. Two approaches were used for classification of these speech samples: (1) using domain knowledge: extracting an extensive set of clinically relevant linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech and transcripts based on prior literature, and (2) using transfer-learning and leveraging large pre-trained machine learning models: using transcript-representations that are automatically derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, by fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We compared the utility of speech transcript representations obtained from recent natural language processing models (i.e., BERT) to more clinically-interpretable language feature-based methods. Both the feature-based approaches and fine-tuned BERT models significantly outperformed the baseline linguistic model using a small set of linguistic features, demonstrating the importance of extensive linguistic information for detecting cognitive impairments relating to AD. We observed that fine-tuned BERT models numerically outperformed feature-based approaches on the AD detection task, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our main contribution is the observation that when tested on the same, demographically balanced dataset and tested on independent, unseen data, both domain knowledge and pretrained linguistic models have good predictive performance for detecting AD based on speech. It is notable that linguistic information alone is capable of achieving comparable, and even numerically better, performance than models including both acoustic and linguistic features here. We also try to shed light on the inner workings of the more black-box natural language processing model by performing an interpretability analysis, and find that attention weights reveal interesting patterns such as higher attribution to more important information content units in the picture description task, as well as pauses and filler words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets, using consistent same training parameters and independent test datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive and Motor Perseveration Are Associated in Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging causes perseveration (difficulty to switch between actions) in motor and cognitive tasks, suggesting that the same neural processes could govern these abilities in older adults. To test this, we evaluated the relation between independently measured motor and cognitive perseveration in young (21.4 ± 3.7 y/o) and older participants (76.5 ± 2.9 y/o). Motor perseveration was measured with a locomotor task in which participants had to transition between distinct walking patterns. Cognitive perseveration was measured with a card matching task in which participants had to switch between distinct matching rules. We found that perseveration in the cognitive and motor domains were positively related in older, but not younger individuals, such that participants exhibiting greater perseveration in the motor task also perseverated more in the cognitive task. Additionally, exposure reduces motor perseveration: older adults who had practiced the motor task could transition between walking patterns as proficiently as naïve, young individuals. Our results suggest an overlap in neural processes governing cognitive and motor perseveration with aging and that exposure can counteract the age-related motor perseveration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Foreign Language Learning as Cognitive Training to Prevent Old Age Disorders? Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Language Training vs. Musical Training and Social Interaction in Elderly With Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: With aging comes a reduction of cognitive flexibility, which has been related to the development of late-life depression and progression of general cognitive decline. Several factors have been linked to attenuating such decline in cognitive flexibility, such as education, physical exercise and stimulating leisure activities. Speaking two or more languages has recently received abundant attention as another factor that may build up cognitive reserve, thereby limiting the functional implications of compromised cognition that accompany old age. With the number of older adults reaching record levels, it is important to attenuate the development of old-age disorders. Learning to speak a foreign language might offer a powerful tool in promoting healthy aging, but up to date effect studies are sparse. Here, the protocol that forms the foundation of the current study is presented. The present study aims to: (1) examine the effects of a foreign language training on cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings, and on mental health; and (2) assess the unique role of foreign language training vs. other cognitive or social programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: One-hundred and ninety-eight Dutch elderly participants reporting subjective cognitive decline are included and randomized to either a language intervention, a music intervention, or a social control intervention. During 3 to 6 months, the language group learns English, the music group learns to play the guitar and the social group participates in social meetings where art workshops are offered. At baseline, at a 3-month follow-up, and at 6 months after termination of the training program, clinical, cognitive and brain activity measurements (combined EEG and fNIRS methods) are taken to assess cognitive flexibility and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This is the first trial addressing combined effects of language learning in elderly on cognition, language proficiency, socio-affective measures, and brain activity in the context of a randomized controlled trial. If successful, this study can provide insights into how foreign language training can contribute to more cognitively and mentally healthy years in older adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, July 2, 2018, trial number NL7137. https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7137.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Investigation of Autosomal Genetic Sex Differences in Parkinson's disease</title>

	<description>Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Males are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to females with European ancestry. Over the years genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex‐specific manner.


Methods
In an effort to study sex‐specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored two large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta‐analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.


Results
In total 19 genome‐wide significant regions were identified and no sex‐specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWASes was identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~20%).


Interpretation
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus females.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Detecting adherence to the recommended childhood vaccination schedule from user-generated content in a US parenting forum</title>

Vaccine hesitancy is considered as one of the leading causes for the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases. A non-negligible minority of parents does not fully adhere to the recommended vaccination schedule, leading their children to be partially immunized and at higher risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases. Here, we leverage more than one million comments of 201,986 users posted from March 2008 to April 2019 on the public online forum BabyCenter US to learn more about such parents. For 32% with geographic location, we find the number of mapped users for each US state resembling the census population distribution with good agreement. We employ Natural Language Processing to identify 6884 and 10,131 users expressing their intention of following the recommended and alternative vaccination schedule, respectively RSUs and ASUs. From the analysis of their activity on the forum we find that ASUs have distinctly different interests and previous experiences with vaccination than RSUs. In particular, ASUs are more likely to follow groups focused on alternative medicine, are two times more likely to have experienced adverse events following immunization, and to mention more serious adverse reactions such as seizure or developmental regression. Content analysis of comments shows that the resources most frequently shared by both groups point to governmental domains (.gov). Finally, network analysis shows that RSUs and ASUs communicate between each other (indicating the absence of echo chambers), however with the latter group being more endogamic and favoring interactions with other ASUs. While our findings are limited to the specific platform analyzed, our approach may provide additional insights for the development of campaigns targeting parents on digital platforms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LUxN24a33jc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Efficient population coding depends on stimulus convergence and source of noise</title>

Sensory organs transmit information to downstream brain circuits using a neural code comprised of spikes from multiple neurons. According to the prominent efficient coding framework, the properties of sensory populations have evolved to encode maximum information about stimuli given biophysical constraints. How information coding depends on the way sensory signals from multiple channels converge downstream is still unknown, especially in the presence of noise which corrupts the signal at different points along the pathway. Here, we calculated the optimal information transfer of a population of nonlinear neurons under two scenarios. First, a lumped-coding channel where the information from different inputs converges to a single channel, thus reducing the number of neurons. Second, an independent-coding channel when different inputs contribute independent information without convergence. In each case, we investigated information loss when the sensory signal was corrupted by two sources of noise. We determined critical noise levels at which the optimal number of distinct thresholds of individual neurons in the population changes. Comparing our system to classical physical systems, these changes correspond to first- or second-order phase transitions for the lumped- or the independent-coding channel, respectively. We relate our theoretical predictions to coding in a population of auditory nerve fibers recorded experimentally, and find signatures of efficient coding. Our results yield important insights into the diverse coding strategies used by neural populations to optimally integrate sensory stimuli in the presence of distinct sources of noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uMJV6mqDdZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effect of synchronization of firings of different motor unit types on the force variability in a model of the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle</title>

The synchronized firings of active motor units (MUs) increase the oscillations of muscle force, observed as physiological tremor. This study aimed to investigate the effects of synchronizing the firings within three types of MUs (slow—S, fast resistant to fatigue–FR, and fast fatigable–FF) on the muscle force production using a mathematical model of the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The model was designed based on the actual proportion and physiological properties of MUs and motoneurons innervating the muscle. The isometric muscle and MU forces were simulated by a model predicting non-synchronized firing of a pool of 57 MUs (including 8 S, 23 FR, and 26 FF) to ascertain a maximum excitatory signal when all MUs were recruited into the contraction. The mean firing frequency of each MU depended upon the twitch contraction time, whereas the recruitment order was determined according to increasing forces (the size principle). The synchronization of firings of individual MUs was simulated using four different modes and inducing the synchronization of firings within three time windows (± 2, ± 4, and ± 6 ms) for four different combinations of MUs. The synchronization was estimated using two parameters, the correlation coefficient and the cross-interval synchronization index. The four scenarios of synchronization increased the values of the root-mean-square, range, and maximum force in correlation with the increase of the time window. Greater synchronization index values resulted in higher root-mean-square, range, and maximum of force outcomes for all MU types as well as for the whole muscle output; however, the mean spectral frequency of the forces decreased, whereas the mean force remained nearly unchanged. The range of variability and the root-mean-square of forces were higher for fast MUs than for slow MUs; meanwhile, the relative values of these parameters were highest for slow MUs, indicating their important contribution to muscle tremor, especially during weak contractions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MMvIEe796bA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The visual system is highly sensitive to spatial context for encoding luminance patterns. Context sensitivity inspired the proposal of many neural mechanisms for explaining the perception of luminance (brightness). Here we propose a novel computational model for estimating the brightness of many visual illusions. We hypothesize that many aspects of brightness can be explained by a dynamic filtering process that reduces the redundancy in edge representations on the one hand, while non-redundant activity is enhanced on the other. The dynamic filter is learned for each input image and implements context sensitivity. Dynamic filtering is applied to the responses of (model) complex cells in order to build a gain control map. The gain control map then acts on simple cell responses before they are used to create a brightness map via activity propagation. Our approach is successful in predicting many challenging visual illusions, including contrast effects, assimilation, and reverse contrast with the same set of model parameters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VeY42W5-nio&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

What transpires soon after inhaling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the respiratory virus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Where does infection begin? What are the features of subsequent virus spread? How might host responses quickly contain infection? Two recently published manuscripts have evaluated infection in primary cultures of well-differentiated cells to address these questions and bring more light on the proviral and antiviral components operating during the initial days after SARS-CoV-2 exposure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4eS0Sxaj6Ik&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Sacks, Randolph J. Noelle, Costantino Pitzalis, Robert I. Lechler, Giovanna Lombardi, Pablo D. Becker&lt;/p&gt;

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is expressed on T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in most tumor environments, and its binding to PD-1 on T cells drives them to apoptosis or into a regulatory phenotype. The fact that PD-L1 itself is also expressed on T cells upon activation has been largely neglected. Here, we demonstrate that PD-L1 ligation on human CD25-depleted CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, combined with CD3/TCR stimulation, induces their conversion into highly suppressive T cells. Furthermore, this effect was most prominent in memory (CD45RA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) T cells. PD-L1 engagement on T cells resulted in reduced ERK phosphorylation and decreased AKT/mTOR/S6 signaling. Importantly, T cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibited high basal levels of phosphorylated ERK and following PD-L1 cross-linking both ERK signaling and the AKT/mTOR/S6 pathway failed to be down modulated, making them refractory to the acquisition of a regulatory phenotype. Altogether, our results suggest that PD-L1 signaling on memory T cells could play an important role in resolving inflammatory responses; maintaining a tolerogenic environment and its failure could contribute to ongoing autoimmunity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z5vrkKoDlp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cell death is a vital event in life. Infections and injuries cause lytic cell death, which gives rise to danger signals that can further induce cell death, inflammation, and tissue damage. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an essential, highly conserved and dynamic metabolic pathway. Here, we discover that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a metabolic intermediate of the MVA pathway, functions as a newly identified danger signal to trigger acute cell death leading to neuron loss in stroke. Harboring both a hydrophobic 15-carbon isoprenyl chain and a heavily charged pyrophosphate head, FPP leads to acute cell death independent of its downstream metabolic pathways. Mechanistically, extracellular calcium influx and the cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) exhibit essential roles in FPP-induced cell death. FPP activates TRPM2 opening for ion influx. Furthermore, in terms of a mouse model constructing by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), FPP accumulates in the brain, which indicates the function of the FPP and TRPM2 danger signal axis in ischemic injury. Overall, our data have revealed a novel function of the MVA pathway intermediate metabolite FPP as a danger signal via transient receptor potential cation channels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/22YzXyZQW3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Viral diseases pose major threats to humans and other animals, including the billions of chickens that are an important food source as well as a public health concern due to zoonotic pathogens. Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Marek’s disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Marek’s disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the 2 class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Marek’s disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only 4 viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2*02, the dominantly expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2*02 linked to several Marek’s disease virus (MDV) peptides and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to a core binding peptide of 10 amino acids, compared to the 9 amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qtXckE5WW1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gene4PD: A Comprehensive Genetic Database of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a strong genetic component. A growing number of variants and genes have been reported to be associated with PD; however, there is no database that integrate different type of genetic data, and support analyzing of PD-associated genes (PAGs). By systematic review and curation of multiple lines of public studies, we integrate multiple layers of genetic data (rare variants and copy-number variants identified from patients with PD, associated variants identified from genome-wide association studies, differentially expressed genes, and differential DNA methylation genes) and age at onset in PD. We integrated five layers of genetic data (8302 terms) with different levels of evidences from more than 3,000 studies and prioritized 124 PAGs with strong or suggestive evidences. These PAGs were identified to be significantly interacted with each other and formed an interconnected functional network enriched in several functional pathways involved in PD, suggesting these genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, we identified 10 genes were associated with a juvenile-onset (age ≤ 30 years), 11 genes were associated with an early-onset (age of 30–50 years), whereas another 10 genes were associated with a late-onset (age &amp;gt; 50 years). Notably, the AAOs of patients with loss of function variants in five genes were significantly lower than that of patients with deleterious missense variants, while patients with VPS13C (P = 0.01) was opposite. Finally, we developed an online database named Gene4PD (http://genemed.tech/gene4pd) which integrated published genetic data in PD, the PAGs, and 63 popular genomic data sources, as well as an online pipeline for prioritize risk variants in PD. In conclusion, Gene4PD provides researchers and clinicians comprehensive genetic knowledge and analytic platform for PD, and would also improve the understanding of pathogenesis in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Velocity and Pulsatility Measures in the Perforating Arteries of the Basal Ganglia at 3T MRI in Reference to 7T MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665480</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility can be measured using 7 tesla (T) MRI. Enabling these flow metrics on more widely available 3T systems would make them more employable. It is currently unknown whether these measurements can be performed at 3T MRI due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if flow velocity and pulsatility in the perforating arteries of the basal ganglia (BG) can be measured at 3T MRI and assess the agreement with 7T MRI measurements as reference. Twenty-nine subjects were included, of which 14 patients with aortic coarctation [median age 29 years (21–72)] and 15 controls [median age 27 years (22–64)]. Using a cardiac-gated 2D phase-contrast MRI sequence BG perforating arteries were imaged at 3T and 7T MRI and perforating artery density (N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt;, #/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), flow velocity (V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;, cm/s) and pulsatility index (PI) were determined. Agreement between scanner modalities was assessed using correlation and difference plots with linear regression. A p-value ≤ 0.05 indicated statistical significance. It was shown that perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility can be measured at 3T MRI (N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.21 ± 0.11; V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.04 ± 1.27; PI = 0.49 ± 0.19), although values differed from 7T MRI measurements (N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.95 ± 0.21; V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.89 ± 0.56; PI = 0.28 ± 0.08). The number of detected arteries was lower at 3T (5 ± 3) than 7T MRI (24 ± 6), indicating that 3T MRI is on average a factor 4.8 less sensitive to detect cerebral perforating arteries. Comparison with 7T MRI as reference showed some agreement in N&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt;, but little to no agreement for V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; and PI. Equalizing the modalities’ sensitivity by comparing the detected arteries on 7T MRI with the highest velocity with all vessels detected on 3T MRI, showed some improvement in agreement for PI, but not for V&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;. This study shows that it is possible to measure cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility at 3T MRI, although an approximately fivefold sample size is needed at 3T relative to 7T MRI for a given effect size, and the measurements should be performed with equal scanner field strength and protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroprotective Effects of Fingolimod Supplement on the Retina and Optic Nerve in the Mouse Model of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Favorable effects exerted by long-term administration of fingolimod therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been reported, but sporadic side effects, such as reversible macular edema, also have been recorded. The present study aimed to determine whether fingolimod therapy is beneficial to the visual system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. A decrease in demyelination and axon loss in the optic nerve as well as cellular infiltration, especially the recruited macrophages, was observed in EAE with fingolimod treatment. Fingolimod administration diminished hypergliosis of macroglia, including astrocytes and Müller cells in the retina and optic nerve in EAE. Microglia were hyperactivated in the retina and optic nerve in the EAE mice compared to controls, which could be alleviated by fingolimod treatment. Moreover, apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve was significantly reduced with fingolimod treatment compared to that in the untreated EAE mice. These results suggested that fingolimod exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on the retina and optic nerve in a mouse model of EAE. Considering the paradox of favorable and side effects of fingolimod on visual system, we speculate that side effects including macular oedema caused by fingolimod during MS treatment is tendency to be vasogenic rather than hypergliosis in optic nerve and retina which warrants further neuroophthalmological investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Synaptic Effect of Aδ-Fibers by Pulse-Train Electrical Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of specific small fibers (Aδ- and C-fibers) is used in basic studies on nociception and neuropathic pain and to diagnose neuropathies. For selective stimulation of small fibers, the optimal stimulation waveform parameters are an important aspect together with the study of electrode design. However, determining an optimal stimulation condition is challenging, as it requires the characterization of the response of the small fibers to electrical stimulation. The perception thresholds are generally characterized using single-pulse stimulation based on the strength-duration curve. However, this does not account for the temporal effects of the different waveforms used in practical applications. In this study, we designed an experiment to characterize the effects of multiple pulse stimulation and proposed a computational model that considers electrostimulation of fibers and synaptic effects in a multiscale model. The measurements of perception thresholds showed that the pulse dependency of the threshold was an exponential decay with a maximum reduction of 55%. In addition, the frequency dependence of the threshold showed a U-shaped response with a reduction of 25% at 30 Hz. Moreover, the computational model explained the synaptic effects, which were also confirmed by evoked potential recordings. This study further characterized the activation of small fibers and clarified the synaptic effects, demonstrating the importance of waveform selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
