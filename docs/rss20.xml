	<description>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are diseases of abnormal hematopoietic differentiation with aberrant epigenetic alterations. Azacitidine (AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor widely used to treat MDS and AML, yet the impact of AZA on the cell-surface proteome has not been defined. To identify potential therapeutic targets...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/_HmgX-sUYCM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Understanding why some renewable resources are overharvested while others are conserved remains an important challenge. Most explanations focus on institutional or ecological differences among resources. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that conservation and overharvest can be alternative stable states within the same exclusive-resource management system because of path-dependent...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/FKuk_C6nxas&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Comparative studies of orthologous proteins of species evolved at different temperatures have revealed consistent patterns of temperature-related variation in thermal stabilities of structure and function. However, the precise mechanisms by which interspecific variations in sequence foster these adaptive changes remain largely unknown.

	<description>Despite sharing a common architecture with archetypal voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs), hyperpolarization- and cAMP-activated ion (HCN) channels open upon hyperpolarization rather than depolarization. The basic motions of the voltage sensor and pore gates are conserved, implying that these domains are inversely coupled in HCN channels. Using structure-guided protein engineering, we...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/6Qp8SVH-NlU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Speech comprehension in noisy, multitalker situations poses a challenge. Successful behavioral adaptation to a listening challenge often requires stronger engagement of auditory spatial attention and context-dependent semantic predictions. Human listeners differ substantially in the degree to which they adapt behaviorally and can listen successfully under such circumstances.

	<description>Circulating DNA in plasma consists of short DNA fragments. The biological processes generating such fragments are not well understood. DNASE1L3 is a secreted DNASE1-like nuclease capable of digesting DNA in chromatin, and its absence causes anti-DNA responses and autoimmunity in humans and mice.

	<description>Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are expanded in the CSC niche by increased frequency of symmetric cell divisions at the expense of asymmetric cell divisions. The symmetric division of CSCs is important for the malignant properties of cancer; however, underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Computational Model of Dual Competition between the Basal Ganglia and the Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We propose a model that includes interactions between the cortex, the basal ganglia (BG), and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of BG to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning and the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) using a novel paradigm predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The systemDrive: a Multisite, Multiregion Microdrive with Independent Drive Axis Angling for Chronic Multimodal Systems Neuroscience Recordings in Freely Behaving Animals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A multielectrode system that can address widely separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive, a novel multisite, multiregion microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and nonparallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube–cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and nonparallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long–Evans rats to observe simultaneous single-unit and multiunit activity from multiple widely separated sleep–wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we analyze the cognitive improvements that can be achieved
through hacking the brain and using neuroplasticity. Not all cases of
neuroplasticity are useful, but exposure to gaming, for example, has proven
conducive for learning. We will discuss cortical magnification and receptive
field sizes, as well as topographic brain maps in the context of
neuroplasticity. We finally propose more studies to be performed to improve
musical talent and musical abilities.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01309</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a new model of the oculomotor system, particularly the
vestibulo-ocular reflex, the optokinetic reflex, gaze fixation, and smooth
pursuit. Our key insight is to exploit recent developments on adaptive internal
models. The outcome is a simple model that includes the interactions between
the brainstem and the cerebellum and that recovers behaviors from more than 15
oculomotor experiments. In addition, we put forward a thesis that the
cerebellum embodies internal models of all persistent, exogenous reference and
disturbance signals acting on the body and observable through the error signals
it receives. Our proposed architecture is compared to feedback error learning,
a variant of the computed torque method in robotics and currently the best
developed computational architecture for the cerebellum.

	<description>Amphibians and fish have the ability to regenerate numerous tissues, whereas mammals have a limited regenerative capacity. Despite numerous developmental genes becoming reactivated during regeneration, an extensive analysis is yet to be performed on whether highly regenerative animals utilize unique &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory elements for the reactivation of genes during regeneration and how such &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory elements become activated. Here, we screened regeneration signal-response enhancers at the &lt;i&gt;lhx1&lt;/i&gt; locus using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; and found that the noncoding elements conserved from fish to human function as enhancers in the regenerating nephric tubules. A DNA-binding motif of Arid3a, a component of H3K9me3 demethylases, was commonly found in RSREs. Arid3a binds to RSREs and reduces the H3K9me3 levels. It promotes cell cycle progression and causes the outgrowth of nephric tubules, whereas the conditional knockdown of &lt;i&gt;arid3a&lt;/i&gt; using photo-morpholino inhibits regeneration. These results suggest that Arid3a contributes to the regeneration of nephric tubules by decreasing H3K9me3 on RSREs.</description>

	<description>Perception of seasonal cues is critical for reproductive success in many plants. Exposure to winter cold is a cue that can confer competence to flower in the spring via a process known as vernalization. In certain grasses, exposure to short days is another winter cue that can lead to a vernalized state. In &lt;i&gt;Brachypodium distachyon&lt;/i&gt;, we find that natural variation for the ability of short days to confer competence to flower is due to allelic variation of the &lt;i&gt;FLOWERING LOCUS T&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FT1&lt;/i&gt;) paralog &lt;i&gt;FT-like9&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FTL9&lt;/i&gt;). An active &lt;i&gt;FTL9&lt;/i&gt; allele is required for the acquisition of floral competence, demonstrating a novel role for a member of the &lt;i&gt;FT&lt;/i&gt; family of genes. Loss of the short-day vernalization response appears to have arisen once in &lt;i&gt;B. distachyon&lt;/i&gt; and spread through diverse lineages indicating that this loss has adaptive value, perhaps by delaying spring flowering until the danger of cold damage to flowers has subsided.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41815</link>
	<description>Consistent patterns of positive selection in functionally similar genes can suggest a common selective pressure across a group of species. We use alignments of orthologous protein-coding genes from 39 species of birds to estimate parameters related to positive selection for 11,000 genes conserved across birds. We show that functional pathways related to the immune system, recombination, lipid metabolism, and phototransduction are enriched for positively selected genes. By comparing our results with mammalian data, we find a significant enrichment for positively selected genes shared between taxa, and that these shared selected genes are enriched for viral immune pathways. Using pathogen-challenge transcriptome data, we show that genes up-regulated in response to pathogens are also enriched for positively selected genes. Together, our results suggest that pathogens, particularly viruses, consistently target the same genes across divergent clades, and that these genes are hotspots of host-pathogen conflict over deep evolutionary time.</description>

Although transcript usage quantitative trait loci (tuQTLs) have been mapped across multiple cell types and contexts, it is challenging to distinguish between the main molecular mechanisms controlling transcript usage: promoter choice, splicing and 3ʹ end choice. Here, we analysed RNA-seq data from human macrophages exposed to three inflammatory and one metabolic stimulus. In addition to conventional gene-level and transcript-level analyses, we also directly quantified promoter usage, splicing and 3ʹ end usage. We found that promoters, splicing and 3ʹ ends were predominantly controlled by independent genetic variants enriched in distinct genomic features. Promoter usage QTLs were also 50% more likely to be context-specific than other tuQTLs and constituted 25% of the transcript-level colocalisations with complex traits. Thus, promoter usage might be an underappreciated molecular mechanism mediating complex trait associations in a context-specific manner.</description>

	<description>The turquoise killifish, &lt;i&gt;Nothobranchius furzeri&lt;/i&gt;, is a promising vertebrate model in ageing research and an emerging model organism in genomics, regenerative medicine, developmental biology and ecotoxicology. Its lifestyle is adapted to the ephemeral nature of shallow pools on the African savannah. Its rapid and short active life commences when rains fill the pool: fish hatch, grow rapidly and mature in as few as two weeks, and then reproduce daily until the pool dries out. Its embryos then become inactive, encased in the dry sediment and protected from the harsh environment until the rains return. This invertebrate-like life cycle (short active phase and long developmental arrest) combined with a vertebrate body plan provide the ideal attributes for a laboratory animal.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A β-carotene-binding protein carrying a red pigment regulates body-color transition between green and black in locusts</title>

	<description>Changes of body color have important effects for animals in adapting to variable environments. The migratory locust exhibits body color polyphenism between solitary and gregarious individuals, with the former displaying a uniform green coloration and the latter having a prominent pattern of black dorsal and brown ventral surface. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the density-dependent body color changes of conspecific locusts remain largely unknown. Here, we found that upregulation of β-carotene-binding protein promotes the accumulation of red pigment, which added to the green color palette present in solitary locusts changes it from green to black, and that downregulation of this protein led to the reverse, changing the color of gregarious locusts from black to green. Our results provide insight that color changes of locusts are dependent on variation in the red β-carotene pigment binding to βCBP. This finding of animal coloration corresponds with trichromatic theory of color vision.</description>

	<description>Most behaviors such as making tea are not stereotypical but have an obvious structure. However, analytical methods to objectively extract structure from non-stereotyped behaviors are immature. In this study, we analyze the locomotion of fruit flies and show that this non-stereotyped behavior is well-described by a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). HHMM shows that a fly's locomotion can be decomposed into a few locomotor features, and odors modulate locomotion by altering the time a fly spends performing different locomotor features. Importantly, although all flies in our dataset use the same set of locomotor features, individual flies vary considerably in how often they employ a given locomotor feature, and how this usage is modulated by odor. This variation is so large that the behavior of individual flies is best understood as being grouped into at least 3-5 distinct clusters, rather than variations around an average fly.</description>

	<description>Transcriptional pausing underlies regulation of cellular RNA biogenesis. A consensus pause sequence that acts on RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from bacteria to mammals halts RNAP in an elemental paused state from which longer-lived pauses can arise. Although the structural foundations of pauses prolonged by backtracking or nascent RNA hairpins are recognized, the fundamental mechanism of the elemental pause is less well-defined. Here we report a mechanistic dissection that establishes the elemental pause signal (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) is multipartite; (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) causes a modest conformational shift that puts g-proteobacterial RNAP in an off-pathway state in which template base loading but not RNA translocation is inhibited; and (&lt;i&gt;iii&lt;/i&gt;) allows RNAP to enter pretranslocated and one-base-pair backtracked states easily even though the half-translocated state observed in paused cryo-EM structures rate-limits pause escape. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the elemental pause and a framework to understand how pausing is modulated by sequence, cellular conditions, and regulators.</description>

	<description>The contrast sensitivity function (CSF), how sensitivity varies with the frequency of the stimulus, is a fundamental assessment of visual performance. The CSF is generally assumed to be determined by low-level sensory processes. However, the spatial sensitivities of neurons in the early visual pathways, as measured in experiments with immobilized eyes, diverge from psychophysical CSF measurements in primates. Under natural viewing conditions, as in typical psychophysical measurements, humans continually move their eyes even when looking at a fixed point. Here, we show that the resulting transformation of the spatial scene into temporal modulations on the retina constitutes a processing stage that reconciles human CSF and the response characteristics of retinal ganglion cells under a broad range of conditions. Our findings suggest a fundamental integration between perception and action: eye movements work synergistically with the spatio-temporal sensitivities of retinal neurons to encode spatial information.</description>

	<description>Hundreds of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as potential regulators of gene expression, but their functions remain largely unknown. To study the role of lncRNAs during vertebrate development, we selected 25 zebrafish lncRNAs based on their conservation, expression profile or proximity to developmental regulators, and used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate 32 deletion alleles. We observed altered transcription of neighboring genes in some mutants, but none of the lncRNAs were required for embryogenesis, viability or fertility. Even RNAs with previously proposed non-coding functions (&lt;i&gt;cyrano&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;squint&lt;/i&gt;) and other conserved lncRNAs (&lt;i&gt;gas5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;lnc-setd1ba)&lt;/i&gt; were dispensable. In one case (&lt;i&gt;lnc-phox2bb&lt;/i&gt;), absence of putative DNA regulatory-elements, but not of the lncRNA transcript itself, resulted in abnormal development. LncRNAs might have redundant, subtle, or context-dependent roles, but extrapolation from our results suggests that the majority of individual zebrafish lncRNAs have no overt roles in embryogenesis, viability and fertility.</description>

	<description>In a group of 831 participants from the general population in the Human Connectome Project, smokers exhibited low overall functional connectivity, and more specifically of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex which is associated with non-reward mechanisms, the adjacent inferior frontal gyrus, and the precuneus. Participants who drank a high amount had overall increases in resting state functional connectivity, and specific increases in reward-related systems including the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the cingulate cortex. Increased impulsivity was found in smokers, associated with decreased functional connectivity of the non-reward-related lateral orbitofrontal cortex; and increased impulsivity was found in high amount drinkers, associated with increased functional connectivity of the reward-related medial orbitofrontal cortex. The main findings were cross-validated in an independent longitudinal dataset with 1176 participants, IMAGEN. Further, the functional connectivities in 14-year-old non-smokers (and also in female low-drinkers) were related to who would smoke or drink at age 19. An implication is that these differences in brain functional connectivities play a role in smoking and drinking, together with other factors.</description>

	<description>Listeners locate potential mates using species-specific vocal signals. As tetrapods transitioned from water to land, lungs replaced gills, allowing expiration to drive sound production. Some frogs then returned to water. Here we explore how air-driven sound production changed upon re-entry to preserve essential acoustic information on species identity in the secondarily aquatic frog genus &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt;. We filmed movements of cartilage and muscles during evoked sound production in isolated larynges. Results refute the current theory for &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; vocalization, cavitation, and favor instead sound production by mechanical excitation of laryngeal resonance modes following rapid separation of laryngeal arytenoid discs. Resulting frequency resonance modes (dyads) are intrinsic to the larynx rather than due to neuromuscular control. Dyads are a distinctive acoustic signature. While their component frequencies overlap across species, their ratio is shared within each &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; clade providing information on species identity that could facilitate both conspecific localization and ancient species divergence.</description>

	<description>Predicting evolutionary change poses numerous challenges. Here we take advantage of the model bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas fluorescens&lt;/i&gt; in which the genotype-to-phenotype map determining evolution of the adaptive ‘wrinkly spreader’ (WS) type is known. We present mathematical descriptions of three necessary regulatory pathways and use these to predict both the rate at which each mutational route is used and the expected mutational targets. To test predictions, mutation rates and targets were determined for each pathway. Unanticipated mutational hotspots caused experimental observations to depart from predictions but additional data led to refined models. A mismatch was observed between the spectra of WS-causing mutations obtained with and without selection due to low fitness of previously undetected WS-causing mutations. Our findings contribute toward the development of mechanistic models for forecasting evolution, highlight current limitations, and draw attention to challenges in predicting locus-specific mutational biases and fitness effects.</description>

	<description>Adaptation in complex biological systems is a consequence of sensitivity to environmental changes. We investigate how responses intensity and speed to unattended background sound changes are influenced by the interaction of external (pitch sequence context) and internal factors (biological regulation). Cortical responses (electroencephalograph Mismatch Negativity) demonstrated increased intensity and prolonged latency in unattended pitch changes in the context of the ascending pitch sequence compared with the descending pitch sequence. Moreover, ascending pitch context is associated with more activation of anterior cingula cortex and insula, suggesting arousal effect and internal regulation. However, the intensified and prolonged responses were supported by cortical and cardiovascular biomarkers for regulation respectively. These findings suggest that biological regulation may be associated with environmental context and play different roles in response sensitivity in terms of intensity and speed.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Calcium phosphate precipitation inhibits mitochondrial energy metabolism</title>

Early studies have shown that moderate levels of calcium overload can cause lower oxidative phosphorylation rates. However, the mechanistic interpretations of these findings were inadequate. And while the effect of excessive calcium overload on mitochondrial function is well appreciated, there has been little to no reports on the consequences of low to moderate calcium overload. To resolve this inadequacy, mitochondrial function from guinea pig hearts was quantified using several well-established methods including high-resolution respirometry and spectrofluorimetry and analyzed using mathematical modeling. We measured key mitochondrial variables such as respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, buffer calcium, and substrate effects for a range of mitochondrial calcium loads from near zero to levels approaching mitochondrial permeability transition. In addition, we developed a computer model closely mimicking the experimental conditions and used this model to design experiments capable of eliminating many hypotheses generated from the data analysis. We subsequently performed those experiments and determined why mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration is significantly lowered during calcium overload. We found that when calcium phosphate levels, not matrix free calcium, reached sufficient levels, complex I activity is inhibited, and the rate of ATP synthesis is reduced. Our findings suggest that calcium phosphate granules form physical barriers that isolate complex I from NADH, disrupt complex I activity, or destabilize cristae and inhibit NADH-dependent respiration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBuKxc7t56w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The lack of a deep understanding of how proteins interact remains an important roadblock in advancing efforts to identify binding partners and uncover the corresponding regulatory mechanisms of the functions they mediate. Understanding protein-protein interactions is also essential for designing specific chemical modifications to develop new reagents and therapeutics. We explored the hypothesis of whether protein interaction sites serve as generic biding sites for non-cognate protein ligands, just as it has been observed for small-molecule-binding sites in the past. Using extensive computational docking experiments on a test set of 241 protein complexes, we found that indeed there is a strong preference for non-cognate ligands to bind to the cognate binding site of a receptor. This observation appears to be robust to variations in docking programs, types of non-cognate protein probes, sizes of binding patches, relative sizes of binding patches and full-length proteins, and the exploration of obligate and non-obligate complexes. The accuracy of the docking scoring function appears to play a role in defining the correct site. The frequency of interaction of unrelated probes recognizing the binding interface was utilized in a simple prediction algorithm that showed accuracy competitive with other state of the art methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xdzyIfrYTuk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cancer development is driven by series of events involving mutations, which may become fixed in a tumor via genetic drift and selection. This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30–40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline &lt;i&gt;ELANE&lt;/i&gt; mutation. Acquired mutations in &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; occur in &amp;gt;70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an &lt;i&gt;ELANE&lt;/i&gt; mutation causes SCN; &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the &lt;i&gt;CSF3R&lt;/i&gt; truncation mutation. Phase 2 occurs postnatally through adult stages with bone marrow production of granulocyte precursors and positive selection of mutants due to chronic G-CSF therapy to reverse the severe neutropenia. We predict the existence of the pool of cells with the mutated truncated receptor &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; G-CSF treatment begins. The model does not require increase in mutation rate under G-CSF treatment and agrees with age distribution of sMDS onset and clinical sequencing data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HE-IeA48wrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Classical decision theory postulates that choices proceed from subjective values assigned to the probable outcomes of alternative actions. Some authors have argued that opposite causality should also be envisaged, with choices influencing subsequent values expressed in desirability ratings. The idea is that agents may increase their ratings of items that they have chosen in the first place, which has been typically explained by the need to reduce cognitive dissonance. However, evidence in favor of this reverse causality has been the topic of intense debates that have not reached consensus so far. Here, we take a novel approach using Bayesian techniques to compare models in which choices arise from stable (but noisy) underlying values (one-way causality) versus models in which values are in turn influenced by choices (two-way causality). Moreover, we examined whether in addition to choices, other components of previous actions, such as the effort invested and the eventual action outcome (success or failure), could also impact subsequent values. Finally, we assessed whether the putative changes in values were only expressed in explicit ratings, or whether they would also affect other value-related behaviors such as subsequent choices. Behavioral data were obtained from healthy participants in a rating-choice-rating-choice-rating paradigm, where the choice task involves deciding whether or not to exert a given physical effort to obtain a particular food item. Bayesian selection favored two-way causality models, where changes in value due to previous actions affected subsequent ratings, choices and action outcomes. Altogether, these findings may help explain how values and actions drift when several decisions are made successively, hence highlighting some shortcomings of classical decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UYQdWjzKcBg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transthyretin (TTR) related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in &lt;i&gt;TTR&lt;/i&gt;. Age‐at‐onset (AO) ranges 19‐82 years and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of ten genes, had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed 329 Portuguese patients, from 123 families. Repeat length (at &lt;i&gt;ATXN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TBP, ATN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;JPH3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;DMPK&lt;/i&gt;) was assessed by single and multiplex PCR, using fluorescently‐labelled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centred approach and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for AO correlation between family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, the presence of at least one allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% CI: [‐8.81; ‐2.19], p=0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat &lt;i&gt;loci&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Length of normal repeats at &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; role in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow‐up of presymptomatic carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Final Results of the RHAPSODY Trial: A Multi‐Center, Phase 2 Trial Using a Continual Reassessment Method to Determine the Safety and Tolerability of 3K3A‐APC, A Recombinant Variant of Human Activated Protein C, in Combination with Tissue Plasminogen Activator, Mechanical Thrombectomy or both in Moderate to Severe Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agonism of protease‐activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro‐ and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 μg/kg of 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra‐arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest‐dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540 μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 ± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 ± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co‐occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well‐validated measure of systemic vascular risk and &lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;‐amyloid (A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office‐based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS‐CVD). We acquired A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant interaction between FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS‐CVD and elevated A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.16).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neural basis of induced phantom limb pain relief</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‐related disease mechanisms. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. Although NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‐induced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalization to related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a within‐participants, double‐blind, and sham‐controlled design to alleviate PLP via task‐concurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least 1 week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‐ and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‐ and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‐concurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions. &lt;b&gt;Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite much attention to the use of biomarkers for predicting Alzheimer disease, little information is available at the individual level. We used the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging to estimate absolute risk of cognitive impairment by biomarker group. Risk increased with age and any biomarker abnormality. For example, a 75‐year‐old with abnormal amyloid and cortical thinning biomarkers has about a 20% chance of cognitive impairment by age 80 years, whereas with normal biomarkers the chance is &amp;lt;10%. Persons with only one abnormal biomarker had similar intermediate risks. Ann Neurol 2018:1–6&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cognitive and Pathological Influences of Tau Pathology in Lewy Body Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25392?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25392?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use digital histology in a large autopsy cohort of Lewy body disorder (LBD) patients with dementia to test the hypotheses that co‐occurring Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology impacts the anatomic distribution of α‐synuclein (SYN) pathology and that co‐occurring neocortical tau pathology in LBDs associates with worse cognitive performance and occurs in a pattern differing from AD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐five autopsy‐confirmed LBD (Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 36; dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 19) patients and 25 AD patients were studied. LBD patients were categorized as having moderate/severe AD copathology (SYN + AD = 20) or little/no AD copathology (SYN−AD = 35). Digital measures of tau, β‐amyloid (Aβ), and SYN histopathology in neocortical and subcortical/limbic regions were compared between groups and related to antemortem cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN burden was higher in SYN + AD than SYN−AD in each neocortical region (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 54&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.6–6.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.02) but was equivalent in entorhinal cortex and putamen (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 43–49&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7–1.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.2). SYN + AD performed worse than SYN−AD on a temporal lobe–mediated naming task (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Antemortem cognitive test scores inversely correlated with tau burden (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = −0.39 to −0.68, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). AD had higher tau than SYN + AD in all regions (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 43&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.8–97.2, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); however, SYN + AD had a greater proportion of tau in the temporal neocortex than AD (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas AD had a greater proportion of tau in the frontal neocortex than SYN + AD (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.002). SYN + AD had similar severity and distribution of neocortical Aβ compared to AD (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 40–43&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6–2.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBD patients with AD copathology harbor greater neocortical SYN pathology. Regional tau pathology relates to cognitive performance in LBD dementia, and its distribution may diverge from pure AD. Tau copathology contributes uniquely to the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in LBD. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Clinical Outcomes Depending on Acute Blood Pressure After Cerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible patients who were randomized to the ATACH‐2 (Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2) trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;: NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&amp;lt;120, 120–130, 130–140, 140–150, and ≥ 150 mmHg) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 to 6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 ml from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardiorenal adverse events within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4 to 6 was 37.5, 36.0, 42.8, 38.6, and 38.0%, respectively. For the “140 to 150” group relative to the “120 to 130,” the odds ratio (OR), adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9, 13.7, 21.4, 18.5, and 26.4%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05–3.09) and “≥150” (1.98; 1.12–3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than the 120 to 130 group. Cardiorenal events occurred in 13.6, 16.6, 11.5, 8.1, and 8.2%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (0.43; 0.19–0.88) and ≥ 150 (0.44; 0.18–0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the 120 to 130.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120 to 130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardiorenal complications. &lt;b&gt;Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a disorder characterised by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Both
local and network abnormalities have been associated with epilepsy, and the
exact processes generating seizures are thought to be heterogeneous and
patient-specific. Due to the heterogeneity, treatments such as surgery and
medication are not always effective in achieving full seizure control and
choosing the best treatment for the individual patient can be challenging.
Predictive models constrained by the patient's own data therefore offer the
potential to assist in clinical decision making. In this chapter, we describe
how personalised patient-derived networks from structural or functional
connectivity can be incorporated into predictive models. We focus specifically
on dynamical systems models which are composed of differential equations
capable of simulating brain activity over time. Here we review recent studies
which have used these models, constrained by patient data, to make personalised
patient-specific predictions about seizure features (such as propagation
patterns) or treatment outcomes (such as the success of surgical resection).
Finally, we suggest future research directions for patient-specific network
models in epilepsy, including their application to integrate information from
multiple modalities, to predict long-term disease evolution, and to account for
within-subject variability for treatment.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Unified Theory of Early Visual Representations from Retina to Cortex through Anatomically Constrained Deep CNNs. (arXiv:1901.00945v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual system is hierarchically organized to process visual information
in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first
stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell
receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,
whereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a
precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these
differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional
neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we
show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence
of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,
and we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at
the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced
number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the
optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple
cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as
nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and
faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result
predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated
nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,
whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the
visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These
predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina
as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes,
by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two
objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their
visual system.

	<description>The anion channelrhodopsin &lt;i&gt;Gt&lt;/i&gt;ACR1 from the alga &lt;i&gt;Guillardia theta&lt;/i&gt; is a potent neuron-inhibiting optogenetics tool. Presented here, its X-ray structure at 2.9 Å reveals a tunnel traversing the protein from its extracellular surface to a large cytoplasmic cavity. The tunnel is lined primarily by small polar and aliphatic residues essential for anion conductance. A disulfide-immobilized extracellular cap facilitates channel closing and the ion path is blocked mid-membrane by its photoactive retinylidene chromophore and further by a cytoplasmic side constriction. The structure also reveals a novel photoactive site configuration that maintains the retinylidene Schiff base protonated when the channel is open. These findings suggest a new channelrhodopsin mechanism, in which the Schiff base not only controls gating, but also serves as a direct mediator for anion flux.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hemispheric Module-Specific Influence of the X Chromosome on White Matter Connectivity: Evidence from Girls with Turner Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy335</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by the congenital absence of all or part of one of the X chromosomes in females, offering a valuable human “knockout model” to study the functioning patterns of the X chromosome in the human brain. Little is known about whether and how the loss of the X chromosome influences the brain structural wiring patterns in human. We acquired a multimodal MRI dataset and cognitive assessments from 22 girls with TS and 21 age-matched control girls to address these questions. Hemispheric white matter (WM) networks and modules were derived using refined diffusion MRI tractography. Statistical comparisons revealed a reduced topological efficiency of both hemispheric networks and bilateral parietal modules in TS girls. Specifically, the efficiency of right parietal module significantly mediated the effect of the X chromosome on working memory performance, indicating that X chromosome loss impairs working memory performance by disrupting this module. Additionally, TS girls showed structural and functional connectivity decoupling across specific within- and between-modular connections, predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings provide novel insights into the functional pathways in the brain that are regulated by the X chromosome and highlight a module-specific genetic contribution to WM connectivity in the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: I See Your Effort: Force-Related BOLD Effects in an Extended Action Execution–Observation Network Involving the Cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Action observation (AO) is crucial for motor planning, imitation learning, and social interaction, but it is not clear whether and how an action execution–observation network (AEON) processes the effort of others engaged in performing actions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used a “squeeze ball” task involving different grip forces to investigate whether AEON activation showed similar patterns when executing the task or observing others performing it. Both in action execution, AE (subjects performed the visuomotor task) and action observation, AO (subjects watched a video of the task being performed by someone else), the fMRI signal was detected in cerebral and cerebellar regions. These responses showed various relationships with force mapping onto specific areas of the sensorimotor and cognitive systems. Conjunction analysis of AE and AO was repeated for the “0th” order and linear and nonlinear responses, and revealed multiple AEON nodes remapping the detection of actions, and also effort, of another person onto the observer’s own cerebrocerebellar system. This result implies that the AEON exploits the cerebellum, which is known to process sensorimotor predictions and simulations, performing an internal assessment of forces and integrating information into high-level schemes, providing a crucial substrate for action imitation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Enhanced Population Coding for Rewarded Choices in the Medial Frontal Cortex of the Mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Instrumental behavior is characterized by the selection of actions based on the degree to which they lead to a desired outcome. However, we lack a detailed understanding of how rewarded actions are reinforced and preferentially implemented. In rodents, the medial frontal cortex is hypothesized to play an important role in this process, based in part on its capacity to encode chosen actions and their outcomes. We therefore asked how neural representations of choice and outcome might interact to facilitate instrumental behavior. To investigate this question, we imaged neural ensemble activity in layer 2/3 of the secondary motor region (M2) while mice engaged in a two-choice auditory discrimination task with probabilistic outcomes. Correct choices could result in one of three reward amounts (single, double or omitted reward), which allowed us to measure neural and behavioral effects of reward magnitude, as well as its categorical presence or absence. Single-unit and population decoding analyses revealed a consistent influence of outcome on choice signals in M2. Specifically, rewarded choices were more robustly encoded relative to unrewarded choices, with little dependence on the exact magnitude of reinforcement. Our results provide insight into the integration of past choices and outcomes in the rodent brain during instrumental behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stochastic neural field model of stimulus-dependent variability in cortical neurons</title>

	<description>We use stochastic neural field theory to analyze the stimulus-dependent tuning of neural variability in ring attractor networks. We apply perturbation methods to show how the neural field equations can be reduced to a pair of stochastic nonlinear phase equations describing the stochastic wandering of spontaneously formed tuning curves or bump solutions. These equations are analyzed using a modified version of the bivariate von Mises distribution, which is well-known in the theory of circular statistics. We first consider a single ring network and derive a simple mathematical expression that accounts for the experimentally observed bimodal (or M-shaped) tuning of neural variability. We then explore the effects of inter-network coupling on stimulus-dependent variability in a pair of ring networks. These could represent populations of cells in two different layers of a cortical hypercolumn linked via vertical synaptic connections, or two different cortical hypercolumns linked by horizontal patchy connections within the same layer. We find that neural variability can be suppressed or facilitated, depending on whether the inter-network coupling is excitatory or inhibitory, and on the relative strengths and biases of the external stimuli to the two networks. These results are consistent with the general observation that increasing the mean firing rate via external stimuli or modulating drives tends to reduce neural variability.</description>

	<description>A critical area of inquiry in the neurobiology of alcohol abuse is the neural mechanisms by which cues gain the ability to elicit alcohol use. We previously showed that cue-evoked activity in rat ventral pallidum (VP) robustly encodes the value of cues trained under both Pavlovian and instrumental contingencies, despite a stronger relationship between cue-evoked responses and behavioral latency after instrumental training. Here, we assessed VP neural representations of cue value in rats trained with a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS+) that predicted alcohol delivery, and in rats trained with an instrumental discriminative stimulus (DS) that predicted alcohol availability if the rat entered the reward port during the cue. We also examined the impact of alcohol exposure itself on the integrity of this type of signaling in rats trained with sucrose. Decoding of cue value based on VP firing was blunted for an alcohol CS+ versus an alcohol DS, as well as in comparison to a sucrose DS or CS+. Further, homecage alcohol exposure had opposing effects on VP encoding of cue value for a sucrose DS versus a sucrose CS+, enhancing decoding accuracy for the DS and reducing decoding accuracy for the CS+. These findings suggest that problem alcohol seeking may result from biased engagement of specific reward-related processes via changes in VP signaling.</description>

	<description>Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among pregnant women. Moreover, over half of pregnant women who are consuming cannabis are also consuming alcohol; however, the consequences of combined prenatal alcohol and cannabis exposure on fetal development are not well understood. The current study examined behavioral development following exposure to ethanol (EtOH) and/or CP-55,940 (CP), a cannabinoid receptor agonist. From postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester, Sprague-Dawley rats received EtOH (5.25g/kg/day) or sham intubation, as well as CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. All subjects were tested on open field activity (PD 18-21), spatial learning (PD 40-46), and elevated plus maze (PD 30) tasks. Both EtOH and CP increased locomotor activity in the open field, and the combination produced more severe overactivity than either exposure alone. Similarly, increases in thigmotaxis in the Morris water maze were caused by either EtOH or CP alone, and were more severe with combined exposure, although only EtOH impaired spatial learning. Finally, developmental CP, but not EtOH, increased time spent in the open arms on the elevated plus maze. Overall, these data indicate that EtOH and CP produce some independent domain-specific effects, but many effects of EtOH and CP on behavior were additive. Importantly, these data suggest that combined prenatal exposure to alcohol and cannabis may be more damaging to the developing fetus, which has implications for the lives of affected individuals and families and also for establishing public health policy.</description>

	<description>Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among pregnant women, and rates are likely to increase given recent legalization. In addition, half of pregnant women who report consuming cannabis also report drinking alcohol. However, little is known about the consequences of prenatal cannabis alone or combination with alcohol, particularly with cannabis products that are continually increasing in potency of the primary psychoactive constituent in cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The current study investigated the effects of early exposure to cannabinoids during the brain growth spurt on early physical and motor development alone (Experiment 1) or in combination with alcohol (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to a cannabinoid receptor agonist (CP-55,940 [CP]; 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 mg/kg/day), the drug vehicle, or a saline control from postnatal days (PD) 4-9. In Experiment 2, rat pups were exposed to CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or the vehicle, and were additionally intubated with alcohol (11.9% v/v; 5.25 g/kg/day) or received a sham intubation. Subjects in both experiments were tested on a motor development task (PD 12-20) and a motor coordination task during adolescence (PD 30-32). Both developmental cannabinoid and alcohol exposure separately decreased body growth throughout development, and combined exposure exacerbated these effects, although only alcohol exposure induced long-term body weight reductions. Developmental cannabinoid exposure advanced early motor development, whereas alcohol exposure delayed development, and subjects given combined exposure did not differ from controls on some measures. Alcohol exposure impaired motor coordination later in life. In contrast, cannabinoid exposure, by itself did not significantly affect long-term motor coordination, but did exacerbate alcohol-related impairments in motor coordination among females. These results suggest that cannabinoid exposure may not only alter development by itself, but may exacerbate the teratogenic effects of alcohol in specific behavioral domains. These findings have important implications not only for individuals affected by prenatal exposure, but also for establishing public policy for women regarding cannabis use during pregnancy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An EEG study of detection without localisation in change blindness</title>

	<description>Previous studies of change blindness have suggested a distinction between detection and localisation of changes in a visual scene. Using a simple paradigm with an array of coloured squares, the present study aimed to further investigate differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) between trials in which participants could detect the presence of a colour change but not identify the location of the change (sense trials), versus those where participants could both detect and localise the change (localise trials). Individual differences in performance were controlled for by adjusting the difficulty of the task in real time. Behaviourally, reaction times for sense, blind, and false alarm trials were distinguishable when comparing across levels of participant certainty. In the EEG data, we found no significant differences in the visual awareness negativity ERP, contrary to previous findings. In the N2pc range, both awareness conditions (localise and sense) were significantly different to trials with no change detection (blind trials), suggesting that this ERP is not dependent on explicit awareness. Within the late parietal positivity range, all conditions were significantly different. These results suggest that changes can be 'sensed' without knowledge of the location of the changing object, and that participant certainty scores can provide valuable information about the perception of changes in change blindness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The interplay between multisensory integration and perceptual decision making</title>

	<description>Facing perceptual uncertainty, the brain combines information from different senses to shape optimal decision making and to guide behavior. Despite overlapping neural networks underlying multisensory integration and perceptual decision making, the process chain of decision formation has been studied mostly in unimodal contexts and is thought to be supramodal. To reveal whether and how multisensory processing interplay with perceptual decision making, we devised a paradigm mimicking naturalistic situations where human participants were exposed to continuous cacophonous audiovisual inputs containing an unpredictable relevant signal cue in one or two modalities. Using multivariate pattern analysis on concurrently recorded EEG, we decoded the neural signatures of sensory encoding and decision formation stages. Generalization analyses across conditions and time revealed that multisensory signal cues were processed faster during both processing stages. We further established that acceleration of neural dynamics was directly linked to two distinct multisensory integration processes and associated with multisensory benefit. Our results, substantiated in both detection and categorization tasks, provide evidence that the brain integrates signals from different modalities at both the sensory encoding and the decision formation stages.</description>

	<description>Neural computation, which relies on the active storage and sharing of information, occurs within large neuron networks in the highly dynamic context of varying brain states. Whether such functions are performed by specific subsets of neurons and whether they occur in specific dynamical regimes remain poorly understood. Using high density recordings in the hippocampus, medial entorhinal and medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, we identify computing microstates, or discreet epochs, in which specific computing hub neurons perform well defined storage and sharing operations in a brain state-dependent manner. We retrieve a multiplicity of distinct computing microstates within each global brain state, such as REM and nonREM sleep. Half of recorded neurons act as computing hubs in at least one microstate, suggesting that functional roles are not firmly hardwired but dynamically reassigned at the second timescale. We identify sequences of microstates whose temporal organization is dynamic and stands between order and disorder. We propose that global brain states constrain the language of neuronal computations by regulating the syntactic complexity of these microstate sequences.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/513283v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Intrinsic plasticity of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) is recently highlighted in the cerebellar local circuits, however, its physiological impact on the cerebellar learning and memory remains elusive. Using a mouse model of memory consolidation deficiency, we found that the intrinsic plasticity of PCs may be involved in motor memory consolidation. Gain-up training of the vestibulo-ocular reflex produced a decrease in the synaptic weight of PCs in both the wild-type and knockout groups. However, intrinsic plasticity was impaired only in the knockout mice. Furthermore, the observed defects in the intrinsic plasticity of PCs led to the formation of improper neural plasticity in the vestibular nucleus (VN) neurons. Our results suggest that the synergistic modulation of intrinsic and synaptic plasticity in PCs is required for the changes in the local connectivity between the cerebellum and VN that contribute to the long-term storage of motor memory.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual-olfactory integration in the human disease vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti</title>

	<description>Mosquitoes rely on the integration of multiple sensory cues, including olfactory, visual, and thermal stimuli, to detect, identify and locate their hosts [1-4]. Although we increasingly know more about the role of chemosensory behaviours in mediating mosquito-host interactions [1], the role of visual cues remains comparatively less studied [3], and how the combination of olfactory and visual information is integrated in the mosquito brain remains unknown. In the present study, we used a tethered-flight LED arena, which allowed for quantitative control over the stimuli, to show that CO2 exposure affects target-tracking responses, but not responses to large-field visual stimuli. In addition, we show that CO2 modulates behavioural responses to visual objects in a time-dependent manner. To gain insight into the neural basis of this olfactory and visual coupling, we conducted two-photon microscopy experiments in a new GCaMP6s-expressing mosquito line. Imaging revealed that the majority of ROIs in the lobula region of the optic lobe exhibited strong responses to small-field stimuli, but showed little response to a large-field stimulus. Approximately 20% of the neurons we imaged were modulated when an attractive odour preceded the visual stimulus; these same neurons also elicited a small response when the odour was presented alone. By contrast, imaging in the antennal lobe revealed no modulation when visual stimuli were presented before or after the olfactory stimulus. Together, our results are the first to reveal the dynamics of olfactory modulation in visually evoked behaviours of mosquitoes, and suggest that coupling between these sensory systems is asymmetrical and time-dependent.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area regulate non-rapid eye movement sleep in mice</title>

	<description>The daily sleep/wakefulness cycle is regulated by coordinated interactions between sleep- and wakefulness-regulating neural circuitry. However, the detailed neural circuitry mediating sleep is far from understood. Here, we found that glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (Gad67)-positive GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTAGad67+) are a key regulator of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice. VTAGad67+ neurons project to multiple brain areas implicated in sleep/wakefulness regulation such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and dorsal raphe nucleus. Chemogenetic activation of VTAGad67+ neurons promoted NREM sleep with higher delta power whereas optogenetic inhibition of these neurons induced prompt arousal from NREM sleep under highly somnolescent conditions, but not during REM sleep. In vivo fiber photometry recordings revealed that VTAGad67+ neurons showed the highest population activity in NREM sleep and the lowest activity in REM sleep. Acute brain slice electrophysiology combined with optogenetics revealed that VTAGad67+ neurons directly innervate and inhibit wake-promoting orexin/hypocretin neurons in the LH by releasing GABA. Taken together, we reveal that VTAGad67+ neurons play a crucial role in the regulation of NREM sleep.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dissociating orexin-dependent and -independent functions of orexin neurons using novel orexin-Flp knock-in mice</title>

	<description>Uninterrupted arousal is important for survival during threatening situations. Activation of orexin/hypocretin neurons is implicated in sustained arousal. However, orexin neurons produce and release orexin as well as several co-transmitters including dynorphin and glutamate. Thus, it is important to disambiguate orexin peptide-dependent and -independent physiological functions of orexin neurons. To attain this, we generated a novel orexin-flippase (Flp) knock-in (KI) mouse line. Crossing with Flp-reporter or Cre-expressing mice showed gene expression exclusively in orexin neurons. Histological studies confirmed that orexin was completely knock-out (KO) in KI/KI homozygous mice. Orexin neurons without orexin showed altered electrophysiological properties, as well as received decreased glutamatergic inputs. Selective chemogenetic activation revealed that both orexin and co-transmitters functioned to increase wakefulness, however, orexin was indispensable to promote sustained arousal. Surprisingly, activation of orexin neurons without orexin caused a significant increase in the total time spent in cataplexy. Taken together, orexin is essential to maintain basic membrane properties and input-output computation of orexin neurons, as well as to exert awake-sustaining aptitude of orexin neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: VGF in cerebrospinal fluid, when combined with conventional biomarkers, enhances prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer Disease.</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/512939v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sensitive and accurate biomarkers for the prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer Disease (AD) are needed to both support clinical care and enhance clinical trial design. Here, we examined the potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of a peptide derived from a neural protein involved in synaptic transmission, VGF (a non-initialism), to enhance accuracy of prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. The performance of conventional biomarkers (CSF A{beta}1-42 and phosphorylated tau +/- hippocampal volume) was compared to the same biomarkers with CSF VGF peptide levels. It was observed that VGF peptides are lowered in patients with AD compared to controls and that combinations of CSF A{beta}1-42 and phosphorylated tau, hippocampal volume and VGF peptide levels outperformed conventional biomarkers alone (hazard ratio = 2.2 vs. 3.9). VGF peptide levels were correlated most strongly with total tau levels, but not hippocampal volume, suggesting that they serve as a marker for neuronal degradation, but not necessarily in the hippocampus. The latter point suggests that VGF may serve as a more general marker of neurodegeneration. Future work will be needed to determine the specificity of VGF for AD vs. other neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Sensory and direct stimulation of the brain probes its functional repertoire and the information processing capacity of networks. However, a systematic exploration can only be performed in silico. Stimulation takes the system out of its attractor states and samples the environment of the flow to gain insight into the stability and multiplicity of trajectories. It is the only means of obtaining a complete understanding of the healthy brain network's dynamic properties. We built a whole mouse brain model with connectivity derived from tracer studies. We systematically varied the stimulation location, the ratio of long- to short-range interactions, and the range of short connections. Functional networks appeared in the spatial motifs of simulated brain activity. Several motifs included the default mode network, suggesting a junction of functional networks. The model explains processing in sensory systems and replicates the in vivo dynamics after stimulation without parameter tuning, emphasizing the role of connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Internally coupled middle ears enhance the range of interaural time differences heard by the chicken</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/512715v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/512715v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Interaural time differences (ITD) are one of several principle cues for localizing sounds. However, ITD are in the sub-millisecond range for most animals. Because the neural processing of such small ITDs pushes the limit of temporal resolution, the precise ITD-range for a given species and its usefulness - relative to other localization cues - was a powerful selective force in the evolution of the neural circuits involved. Birds and other non-mammals have internally coupled middle ears working as pressure-difference receivers that may significantly enhance ITD, depending on the precise properties of the interaural connection. Here, the extent of this internal coupling was investigated in chickens, specifically under the same experimental conditions as typically used in neurophysiology of ITD-coding circuits, i.e. with headphone stimulation. Cochlear microphonics (CM) were recorded simultaneously from both ears of anesthetized chickens under monaural and binaural stimulation, using pure tones from 0.1 to 3 kHz. Interaural transmission peaked at 1.5 kHz at a loss of only -5.5 dB; the mean interaural delay was 264 s. CM amplitude strongly modulated as a function of ITD, confirming significant interaural coupling. The &quot;ITD heard&quot; derived from the CM phases in both ears showed enhancement, compared to the acoustic stimuli, by a factor of up to 1.8. However, the closed sound delivery systems impaired interaural transmission at low frequencies (&amp;lt; 1 kHz). We identify factors that need to be considered when interpreting neurophysiological data obtained under these conditions, and relating them to the natural free-field condition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural circuitry of dialects through social learning in Drosophila.</title>

	<description>Drosophila species communicate the presence of parasitoid wasps to naive individuals. This observation suggests a rudimentary Drosophila social structure. Communication between closely related species is efficient, while more distantly related species exhibit a dampened, partial communication. Partial communication between some species is enhanced following a period of cohabitation, suggesting that species-specific variations in communication &quot;dialects&quot; can be learned through social interactions. However, it remains unclear as to how the behavioral acquisition and how learning dialects is facilitated by distinct brain regions. In this study, we have identified six regions of the Drosophila brain essential for dialect learning, including the odorant receptor Or69a. Furthermore, we pinpoint subgroups of neurons such as motion detecting neurons in the optic lobe, layer 5 of the fan-shaped body, and the D glomerulus in the antennal lobe, where activation of each are necessary for dialect learning. These results demonstrate that Drosophila can display complex social behaviors with inputs to multiple regions of the Drosophila brain and unique subsets of neurons that must integrate olfactory, visual and motion cues.</description>

	<description>The mesolimbic hypothesis has been a central dogma of schizophrenia for decades, positing that aberrant functioning of midbrain dopamine projections to limbic regions causes psychotic symptoms. Recently, however, advances in neuroimaging techniques have led to the unanticipated finding that dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia is greatest within nigrostriatal pathways, implicating the dorsal striatum in the pathophysiology and calling into question the mesolimbic theory. At the same time our knowledge of striatal anatomy and function has progressed, suggesting new mechanisms via which striatal dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Evaluation of self-generated behavior: untangling metacognitive read-out and error-detection.</title>

	<description>When producing a duration, for instance by pressing a key for one second, the brain relies on self-generated neuronal dynamics to monitor the 'flow of time'. Converging evidence has suggested that the brain can also monitor itself monitoring time. Here, we investigated which brain mechanisms support metacognitive inferences when self-generating timing behavior. Although studies have shown that participants can reliably detect temporal errors when generating a duration (Akdogan &amp;amp; Balci, 2017; Kononowicz et al., 2018), the neural bases underlying the evaluation and the monitoring of this self-generated temporal behavior are unknown. Theories of psychological time have also remained silent about such self-evaluation abilities. How are temporal errors inferred on the basis of purely internally driven brain dynamics without external reference for time? We contrasted the error-detection hypothesis, in which error-detection would result from the comparison of competing motor plans with the read-out hypothesis, in which errors would result from inferring the state of an internal code for motor timing. Human participants generated a time interval, and evaluated the magnitude of their timing (first and second order behavioral judgments, respectively) while being recorded with time-resolved neuroimaging. Focusing on the neural signatures following the termination of self-generated duration, we found several regions involved in performance monitoring, which displayed a linear association between the power of alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz), and the duration of the produced interval. Altogether, our results support the read-out hypothesis and indicate that first-order signals may be integrated for the evaluation of self-generated behavior.</description>

	<description>Direction selective (DS) ganglion cells (GC) in the retina maintain their tuning across a broad range of light levels. Yet very different circuits can shape their responses from bright to dim light, and their respective contributions are difficult to tease apart. In particular, the contribution of the rod bipolar cell (RBC) primary pathway, a key player in dim light, is unclear. To understand its contribution to DSGC response, we designed an all-optical approach allowing precise manipulation of single retinal neurons. Our system activates single cells in the bipolar cell (BC) layer by two-photon (2P) temporally focused holographic illumination, while recording the activity in the ganglion cell layer by 2P Ca2 imaging. By doing so, we demonstrate that RBCs provide an asymmetric input to DSGCs, suggesting they contribute to their direction selectivity. Our results suggest that every circuit providing an input to direction selective cells can generate direction selectivity by itself. This hints at a general principle to achieve robust selectivity in sensory areas.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Protein Co-Evolution Strategies Detect Predicted Functional Interaction Between the Serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C Receptors</title>

	<description>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating activities such as sleep, appetite, mood and substance abuse disorders; serotonin receptors 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR are active within pathways associated with substance abuse. It has been suggested that 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR may form a dimer that affects behavioral processes. Here we study the coevolution of residues in 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR to identify potential interactions between residues in both proteins. Coevolution studies can detect protein interactions, and since the thus uncovered interactions are subject to evolutionary pressure, they are likely functional. We assessed the significance of the 5-HT2AR/5-HT2CR interactions using randomized phylogenetic trees and found the interaction significant (p-value = 0.01). We also discuss how co-expression of the receptors suggests the predicted interaction is functional. Finally, we analyze how several single nucleotide polymorphisms for the 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR genes affect their interaction. Our findings are the first to characterize the binding interface of 5-HT2AR/5-HT2CR and indicate a correlation between this interface and location of SNPs in both proteins.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jignesh H. Parmar, Pedro Mendes&lt;/p&gt;

It is well known that iron is an essential element for life but is toxic when in excess or in certain forms. Accordingly there are many diseases that result directly from either lack or excess of iron. Yet many molecular and physiological aspects of iron regulation have only been discovered recently and others are still elusive. There is still no good quantitative and dynamic description of iron absorption, distribution, storage and mobilization that agrees with the wide array of phenotypes presented in several iron-related diseases. The present work addresses this issue by developing a mathematical model of iron distribution in mice calibrated with ferrokinetic data and subsequently validated against data from mouse models of iron disorders, such as hemochromatosis, β-thalassemia, atransferrinemia and anemia of inflammation. To adequately fit the ferrokinetic data required inclusion of the following mechanisms: a) transferrin-mediated iron delivery to tissues, b) induction of hepcidin by transferrin-bound iron, c) ferroportin-dependent iron export regulated by hepcidin, d) erythropoietin regulation of erythropoiesis, and e) liver uptake of NTBI. The utility of the model to simulate disease interventions was demonstrated by using it to investigate the outcome of different schedules of transferrin treatment in β-thalassemia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4qKAR8v5jU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna C. Sales, Karl J. Friston, Matthew W. Jones, Anthony E. Pickering, Rosalyn J. Moran&lt;/p&gt;

The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm ‘explore/exploit’ task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level ‘state-action’ prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error–reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release–to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC that translates state-action prediction errors into an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A_rbYMuEoU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the relationship between the interictal metabolic patterns, the extent of resection of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET hypometabolism and seizure outcomes in patients with unilateral drug‐resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) following anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐two patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal MRI findings, concordant &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET hypometabolism and at least two years of postoperative follow‐up were included in this two‐centre study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypometabolic regions in each patient were identified with reference to twenty healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.005). The resected temporal lobe (TL) volume and the volume of resected TL PET hypometabolism (TLH) were calculated from the pre‐ and postoperative MRI scans co‐registered with interictal &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking differences in metabolic patterns were observed depending on the lateralisation of the epileptogenic temporal lobe. The extent of the ipsilateral TLH was significantly greater in left MTLE patients &lt;i&gt;(p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), whereas right MTLE patients had significantly higher rates of contralateral (CTL) TLH (&lt;i&gt;p=&lt;/i&gt;0.016). In right MTLE patients, CTL hypometabolism was the strongest predictor of an unfavourable seizure outcome, associated with a five‐fold increase in the likelihood of seizure recurrence (OR 4.90, CI:1.07‐22.39, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.04). In left MTLE patients, the greater the extent of the resection of ipsilateral TLH was associated with lower rates of seizure recurrence (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.004) in univariable analysis, however its predictive value did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.96, CI: 0.90‐1.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.19).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in metabolic patterns depending on the lateralisation of MTLE may represent distinct epileptic networks in patients with right &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; left MTLE, and can guide preoperative counselling and surgical planning.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Activity patterns in the neuropil of striatal cholinergic interneurons in freely moving mice represent their collective spiking dynamics</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&amp;lt; 2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are key modulators of the striatal microcircuitry that are necessary for assigning action value and behavioral flexibility. We present a first endoscopic imaging study of multiple molecularly identified CINs in freely moving mice. We reveal the presence of activity patterns in the CIN neuropil. We then use &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological and imaging techniques to show that the neuropil signal is the integrated fluorescence arising from the axo-dendritic arbors of CINs dispersed throughout the striatum. We conclude that the neuropil signal acts as a mean-field readout of the striatal CIN network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neuron-Specific Gene 2 (NSG2) encodes an AMPA receptor interacting protein that modulates excitatory neurotransmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0292-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neurons have evolved a number of unique protein-coding genes that regulate trafficking of protein complexes within small organelles throughout dendrites axons. Neuron specific gene 2 (NSG2) encodes for one of the most abundant proteins in the nervous system during perinatal development. NSG2 belongs to a family of small neuronal endosomal proteins but its function has remained uncharacterized to date. Here we show that NSG2 is found in discrete punctae restricted to the somatodendritic arbors of developing mouse and human neurons, and a significant proportion of NSG2 punctae colocalize with postsynaptic HOMER1 and surface-expressed AMPARs at excitatory synapses. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NSG2 physically interacts with both the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits in mouse brain. Knockout of NSG2 in mouse hippocampal neurons selectively impaired the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and caused alterations in PSD95 expression at postsynaptic densities. In contrast, NSG2 overexpression caused a significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as GluA2 surface expression. Thus, NSG2 functions as an AMPAR-binding protein that is required for normal synapse formation and/or maintenance, and has unique functions compared with other NSG family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Due to their morphological and functional complexity, neurons have evolved specialized proteins like those of the neuron-specific gene family (NSG1-3). Important developmental and synaptic functions have been attributed to NSG1/NEEP21 and NSG3/Calcyon while the function of NSG2/HMP19/NVTA2 has remained uncharacterized. Here we show that NSG2 localizes to a large proportion of excitatory synapses, interacts with AMPARs, and modulates their surface expression during synaptogenesis. Alterations of NSG2 expression affected both the amplitude and frequency of excitatory neurotransmission that is not compensated for by other NSG family members. Thus, NSG2 appears critical for excitatory synapse formation and/or maintenance and forced expression can promote increased synaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: NMNAT proteins that limit Wallerian degeneration also regulate critical period plasticity in the visual cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions go through critical periods of development during which plasticity is enhanced. These critical periods are associated with extensive growth and retraction of thalamocortical and intracortical axons. Here, we investigated whether a signaling pathway that is central in Wallerian axon degeneration also regulates critical period plasticity in the primary visual cortex. Wallerian degeneration is characterized by rapid disintegration of axons once they are separated from the cell body. This degenerative process is initiated by reduced presence of cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) and is strongly delayed in mice overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT proteins, such as Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice producing a UBE4b-NMNAT1 fusion protein or NMNAT3 transgenic mice. Here we provide evidence that in Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice and NMNAT3-transgenic mice, ocular dominance plasticity in the developing visual cortex is reduced. This deficit is only observed during the second half of the critical period. Additionally, we detect an early increase of visual acuity in the primary visual cortex of Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We do not find evidence for Wallerian degeneration occurring during ocular dominance plasticity. Our findings suggest that NMNATs do not only regulate Wallerian degeneration during pathological conditions, but also control cellular events that mediate critical period plasticity during the physiological development of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Different forms of axon degeneration occur during development and neurodegenerative processes. A good understanding of the molecular and cellular events that regulate these forms of axon degeneration is essential to selectively modulate them for therapeutic purposes. This study shows that genes thought to be selectively involved in pathological axon degeneration are also involved in developmental plasticity, implying that these events are molecularly less separable than previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired conditioned fear extinction learning, a ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-dependent process. PTSD is also associated with dysregulation of vmPFC, circadian, and glucocorticoid hormone function. Rats have rhythmic clock gene expression in the vmPFC that requires appropriate diurnal circulatory patterns of corticosterone (CORT), suggesting the presence of CORT-entrained intrinsic circadian clock function within the PFC. We examined the role of vmPFC clock gene expression and its interaction with CORT profiles in regulation of auditory conditioned fear extinction learning. Extinction learning and recall were examined in male rats trained and tested either in the night (active phase) or in the day (inactive phase). Using a viral vector strategy, &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; clock gene expression were selectively knocked down within the vmPFC. Circulating CORT profiles were manipulated via adrenalectomy (ADX) ± diurnal and acute CORT replacement. Rats trained and tested during the night exhibited superior conditioned fear extinction recall that was absent in rats that had knock-down of vmPFC clock gene expression. Similarly, the superior nighttime extinction recall was absent in ADX rats, but restored in ADX rats given a combination of a diurnal pattern of CORT and acute elevation of CORT during the postextinction training consolidation period. Thus, conditioned fear extinction learning is regulated in a diurnal fashion that requires normal vmPFC clock gene expression and a combination of circadian and training-associated CORT. Strategic manipulation of these factors may enhance the therapeutic outcome of conditioned fear extinction related treatments in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the survival motor neuron (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking SMN. We find that reducing daf-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in &lt;i&gt;daf-2&lt;/i&gt; signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal gamma band power across cortex and striatum is an important phenotype of Huntington’s disease (HD) in both patients and animal models, but neither the origin nor the functional relevance of this phenotype is well understood. Here, we analyzed local field potential (LFP) activity in freely behaving, symptomatic R6/2 and Q175 mouse models and corresponding wild-type (WT) controls. We focused on periods of quiet rest, which show strong  activity in HD mice. Simultaneous recording from motor cortex and its target area in dorsal striatum in the R6/2 model revealed exaggerated functional coupling over that observed in WT between the phase of delta frequencies (1–4 Hz) in cortex and striatum and striatal amplitude modulation of low  frequencies (25–55 Hz; i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC), but no evidence that abnormal cortical activity alone can account for the increase in striatal  power. Both HD mouse models had stronger coupling of  amplitude to  phase and more unimodal phase distributions than their WT counterparts. To assess the possible role of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in these phenomena, we developed a computational model based on additional striatal recordings from Q175 mice. Changes in peak  frequency and power ratio were readily reproduced by our computational model, accounting for several experimental findings reported in the literature. Our results suggest that HD is characterized by both a reorganization of cortico-striatal drive and specific population changes related to intrastriatal synaptic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Decoding Hand Kinematics from Local Field Potentials Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. (arXiv:1901.00708v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Local field potential (LFP) has gained increasing interest as an alternative
input signal for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) due to its informative
features, long-term stability, and low frequency content. However, despite
these interesting properties, LFP-based BMIs have been reported to yield low
decoding performances compared to spike-based BMIs. In this paper, we propose a
new decoder based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network which aims to
improve the decoding performance of LFP-based BMIs. We compare offline decoding
performance of the proposed LSTM decoder to a commonly used Kalman filter (KF)
decoder on hand kinematics prediction tasks from multichannel LFPs. We also
benchmark the performance of LFP-driven LSTM decoder against KF decoder driven
by two types of spike signals: single-unit activity (SUA) and multi-unit
activity (MUA). Our results show that LFP-driven LSTM decoder achieves
significantly better decoding performance than LFP-, SUA-, and MUA-driven KF
decoders. This suggests that LFPs coupled with LSTM decoder could provide high
decoding performance, robust, and low power BMIs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Provoking Predetermined Aperiodic Patterns in Human Brainwaves. (arXiv:1809.01851v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the present work, electroencephalographic recordings of healthy human
participants were performed to study the entrainment of brainwaves using a
variety of stimulus. First, periodic entrainment of the brainwaves was studied
using two different stimuli in the form of periodic auditory and visual
signals. The entrainment with the periodic visual stimulation was consistently
observed, whereas the auditory entrainment was inconclusive. Hence, a photic
(Visual) stimulus, where two frequencies were presented to the subject
simultaneously was used to further explore the bifrequency entrainment of human
brainwaves. Subsequently, the evolution of brainwaves as a result of an
aperiodic stimulation was explored, wherein an entrainment to the predetermined
aperiodic pattern was observed. These results suggest that aperiodic
entrainment could be used as a tool for guided modification of brainwaves. This
could find possible applications in processes such as epilepsy suppression and
biofeedback.

	<description>Variation in DNA methylation enables plants to inherit traits independently of changes to DNA sequence. Here, we have screened an Arabidopsis population of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) for resistance against&lt;i&gt; Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa)&lt;/i&gt;. These lines share the same genetic background, but show variation in heritable patterns of DNA methylation. We identified 4 epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTLs) that provide quantitative resistance without reducing plant growth or resistance to other (a)biotic stresses. Phenotypic characterisation and RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that &lt;i&gt;Hpa-&lt;/i&gt;resistant epiRILs are primed to activate defence responses at the relatively early stages of infection. Collectively, our results show that hypomethylation at selected pericentromeric regions is sufficient to provide quantitative disease resistance, which is associated with genome-wide priming of defence-related genes. Based on comparisons of global gene expression and DNA methylation between the wild-type and resistant epiRILs, we discuss mechanisms by which the pericentromeric epiQTLs could regulate the defence-related transcriptome.</description>

	<description>Kleiber’s law, or the 3/4 -power law scaling of the metabolic rate with body mass, is considered one of the few quantitative laws in biology, yet its physiological basis remains unknown. Here, we report Kleiber’s law scaling in the planarian &lt;i&gt;Schmidtea mediterranea&lt;/i&gt;. Its reversible and life history-independent changes in adult body mass over 3 orders of magnitude reveal that Kleiber’s law does not emerge from the size-dependent decrease in cellular metabolic rate, but from a size-dependent increase in mass per cell. Through a combination of experiment and theoretical analysis of the organismal energy balance, we further show that the mass allometry is caused by body size dependent energy storage. Our results reveal the physiological origins of Kleiber’s law in planarians and have general implications for understanding a fundamental scaling law in biology.</description>

	<description>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is among the most common birth defects. Children with CHD frequently display long-term intellectual and behavioral disability. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac anomalies lead to a reduction in cerebral oxygenation, which appears to profoundly impact on the maturation of cerebral regions responsible for higher-order cognitive functions. In this review we focus on the potential mechanisms by which dysregulation of cortical neuronal development during early life may lead to the significant cognitive impairments that commonly occur in children with CHD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Adolescent forced swim stress increases social anxiety-like behaviors and alters the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor system in the basolateral amygdala of males</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/512350v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/512350v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Adolescence is a developmental period marked by robust neural alterations and heightened vulnerability to stress, a factor that is highly associated with increased risk for emotional processing deficits, such as anxiety. Stress-induced upregulation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (DYN/KOR) system is thought to, in part, underlie the negative affect associated with stress. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key structure involved in anxiety, and neuromodulatory systems, such as the DYN/KOR system, can 1) regulate BLA neural activity in an age-dependent manner in stress-naive animals and 2) underlie stress-induced anxiety in adults. However, the role of the DYN/KOR system in modulating stress-induced anxiety in adolescents is unknown. To test this, we examined the impact of an acute, 2-day forced swim stress (FSS - 10 min each day) on adolescent (postnatal day (P) 35) and adult Sprague-Dawley rats (~P70), followed by behavioral, molecular and electrophysiological assessment 24 hours following FSS. Adolescent males, but not adult males or females of either age, demonstrated social anxiety-like behavioral alterations indexed via significantly reduced social investigation and preference when tested 24 hours following FSS. Conversely, adult males exhibited increased social preference. While there were no FSS-induced changes in expression of genes related to the DYN/KOR system in the BLA, these behavioral alterations were associated with a robust switch in BLA KOR function. Specifically, while the KOR agonist, U69593, significantly increased GABA transmission in the BLA of non-stressed adolescent males, U69593 significantly inhibited BLA GABA transmission in stressed adolescent males, consistent with the observed anxiogenic phenotype in stressed adolescent males. This is the first study to demonstrate a KOR-dependent mechanism that may contribute to stress-induced social anxiety in adolescent males. Importantly, these findings provide evidence for potential KOR-dependent mechanisms that may contribute to pathophysiological interactions with subsequent stress challenges.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Spinal Cord Injury in Rats Disrupts the Circadian System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0328-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) perturbs many physiological systems. The circadian system helps maintain homeostasis throughout the body by synchronizing physiological and behavioral functions to predictable daily events. Whether disruption of these coordinated daily rhythms contributes to SCI-associated pathology remains understudied. Here, we hypothesized that SCI in rats would dysregulate several prominent circadian outputs including glucocorticoids, core temperature, activity, neuroinflammation, and circadian gene networks. Female and male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to clinically relevant thoracic 9 moderate contusion SCI (or laminectomy sham surgery). Diurnal measures—including rhythms of plasma corticosterone (CORT), body temperature, and activity (using small implanted transmitters), and intraspinal circadian and inflammatory gene expression—were studied prior to and after surgery. SCI caused overall increases and disrupted rhythms of the major rodent glucocorticoid, CORT. Presurgery and sham rats displayed expected rhythms in body temperature and activity, whereas rats with SCI had blunted daily rhythms in body temperature and activity. In parallel, SCI disrupted intraspinal rhythms of circadian clock gene expression. Circadian clock genes can act as transcriptional regulators of inflammatory pathways. Indeed, SCI rats also showed dysregulated rhythms in inflammatory gene expression in both the epicenter and distal spinal cord. Our data show that moderate SCI in rats causes wide-ranging diurnal rhythm dysfunction, which is severe at acute time points and gradually recovers over time. Normalizing post-SCI diurnal rhythms could enhance the recovery of homeostasis and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Real-Time Neurofeedback to Modulate {beta}-Band Power in the Subthalamic Nucleus in Parkinsons Disease Patients</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The β-band oscillation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a therapeutic target for Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies demonstrated that l-DOPA decreases the β-band (13–30 Hz) oscillations with improvement of motor symptoms. However, it has not been elucidated whether patients with Parkinson’s disease are able to control the β-band oscillation voluntarily. Here, we hypothesized that neurofeedback training to control the β-band power in the STN induces plastic changes in the STN of individuals with Parkinson’s disease. We recorded the signals from STN deep-brain stimulation electrodes during operations to replace implantable pulse generators in eight human patients (3 male) with bilateral electrodes. Four patients were induced to decrease the β-band power during the feedback training (down-training condition), whereas the other patients were induced to increase (up-training condition). All patients were blinded to their assigned condition. Adjacent contacts that showed the highest β-band power were selected for the feedback. During the 10 min training, patients were shown a circle whose diameter was controlled by the β-band power of the selected contacts. Powers in the β-band during 5 min resting sessions recorded before and after the feedback were compared. In the down-training condition, the β-band power of the selected contacts decreased significantly after feedback in all four patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, the β-band power significantly increased after feedback in two of four patients in the up-training condition. Overall, the patients could voluntarily control the β-band power in STN in the instructed direction (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) through neurofeedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Motion Discrimination and the Motion Aftereffect in Mouse Vision</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure to motion in one direction often leads to the illusion of motion in the opposite direction for stationary objects. This motion aftereffect likely arises across several visual areas from adaptive changes in the balance of activity and competitive interactions. We examined whether or not the mouse was susceptible to this same illusion to determine whether it would be a suitable model for learning about the neural representation of the motion aftereffect. Under a classical conditioning paradigm, mice learned to lick when presented with motion in one direction and not the opposite direction. When the mice were adapted to motion preceding this test, their lick behavior for zero coherence motion was biased for motion in the opposite direction of the adapting stimulus. Overall, lick count versus motion coherence shifted in the opposite direction of the adapting stimulus. This suggests that although the mouse has a simpler visual system compared with primates, it still is subject to the motion aftereffect and may elucidate the underlying circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Hierarchical Cognition Causes Task-Related Deactivations but Not Just in Default Mode Regions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0008-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The well-known deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In three experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead, it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Instant Automated Inference of Perceived Mental Stress through Smartphone PPG and Thermal Imaging. (arXiv:1901.00449v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00449</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00449</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: A smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular
measurement and mental stress monitoring. A smartphone camera-based
PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and a low-cost thermal camera can be used to create
cheap, convenient and mobile monitoring systems. However, to ensure reliable
monitoring results, a person has to remain still for several minutes while a
measurement is being taken. This is very cumbersome and makes its use in
real-life mobile situations quite impractical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective: We propose a system which combines PPG and thermography with the
aim of improving cardiovascular signal quality and capturing stress responses
quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: Using a smartphone camera with a low cost thermal camera added on,
we built a novel system which continuously and reliably measures two different
types of cardiovascular events: i) blood volume pulse and ii)
vasoconstriction/dilation-induced temperature changes of the nose tip. 17
healthy participants, involved in a series of stress-inducing mental workload
tasks, measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short window
of time (20 seconds) immediately after each task. Participants reported their
level of perceived mental stress using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). We
used normalized K-means clustering to reduce interpersonal differences in the
self-reported ratings. For the instant stress inference task, we built novel
low-level feature sets representing variability of cardiovascular patterns. We
then used the automatic feature learning capability of artificial Neural
Networks (NN) to improve the mapping between the extracted set of features and
the self-reported ratings. We compared our proposed method with existing
hand-engineered features-based machine learning methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results, Conclusions: ... due to limited space here, we refer to our
manuscript.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Time irreversibility and its application in epileptic brain electrical activities. (arXiv:1901.00258v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00258</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00258</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Time irreversibility (temporal asymmetry) is one of fundamental properties
that characterize the nonlinearity of complex dynamical processes, and our
brain is a typical complex dynamical system manifested with nonlinearity. Two
subtraction-based parameters, Ys and X2, are employed to measure the
probabilistic differences of permutations instead of raw vectors for the
simplified quantification of time irreversibility, which is validated by
chaotic and reversible processes and the surrogate data. We show that it is
equivalent to quantify time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic
difference between the forward and its backward processes and between the
symmetric permutations. And we detect time irreversibility of two groups of
epileptic EEGs, from the Nanjing General Hospital (NJGH) and from the public
Bonn epileptic database. In our contribution, the manifestation of nonlinearity
of whether healthy or diseased brain electrical activities is highlighted, and
the highest time irreversibility of epileptic EEG during seizures is
demonstrated. NJGH epileptic EEGs during seizure-free intervals of have lower
time irreversibility than the control data while those of the Bonn data sets
have higher nonlinearity than the healthy brain electrical activities. For the
inconsistent results, we conduct multi-scale analysis and elucidate from the
circadian rhythms in epileptic nonlinearity, however, more targeted researches
are needed to verify our assumptions or to determine if there are other reasons
leading to the inconsistency.

	<description>Optical imaging has become a powerful tool for studying brains &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The opacity of adult brains makes microendoscopy, with an optical probe such as a gradient index (GRIN) lens embedded into brain tissue to provide optical relay, the method of choice for imaging neurons and neural activity in deeply buried brain structures. Incorporating a Bessel focus scanning module into two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy, we extended the excitation focus axially and improved its lateral resolution. Scanning the Bessel focus in 2D, we imaged volumes of neurons at high-throughput while resolving fine structures such as synaptic terminals. We applied this approach to the volumetric anatomical imaging of dendritic spines and axonal boutons in the mouse hippocampus, and functional imaging of GABAergic neurons in the mouse lateral hypothalamus &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>The SecA2 protein export system is critical for the virulence of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. However, the mechanism of this export pathway remains unclear. Through a screen for suppressors of a &lt;i&gt;secA2&lt;/i&gt; mutant, we identified a new player in the mycobacterial SecA2 pathway that we named SatS for &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ec&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;2 (&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;wo) &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;uppressor. In &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, SatS is required for the export of a subset of SecA2 substrates and for growth in macrophages. We further identify a role for SatS as a protein export chaperone. SatS exhibits multiple properties of a chaperone, including the ability to bind to and protect substrates from aggregation. Our structural studies of SatS reveal a distinct combination of a new fold and hydrophobic grooves resembling preprotein-binding sites of the SecB chaperone. These results are significant in better defining a molecular pathway for &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; pathogenesis and in expanding our appreciation of the diversity among chaperones and protein export systems.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Nestin Regulates Neurogenesis in Mice Through Notch Signaling From Astrocytes to Neural Stem Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The intermediate filament (nanofilament) protein nestin is a marker of neural stem cells, but its role in neurogenesis, including adult neurogenesis, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of nestin in neurogenesis in adult nestin-deficient (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) mice. We found that the proliferation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; neural stem cells was not altered, but neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;–/–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice was increased. Surprisingly, the proneurogenic effect of nestin deficiency was mediated by its function in the astrocyte niche. Through its role in Notch signaling from astrocytes to neural stem cells, nestin negatively regulates neuronal differentiation and survival; however, its expression in neural stem cells is not required for normal neurogenesis. In behavioral studies, nestin deficiency in mice did not affect associative learning but was associated with impaired long-term memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Short-term synaptic depression can increase the rate of information transfer at a release site</title>

The release of neurotransmitters from synapses obeys complex and stochastic dynamics. Depending on the recent history of synaptic activation, many synapses depress the probability of releasing more neurotransmitter, which is known as synaptic depression. Our understanding of how synaptic depression affects the information efficacy, however, is limited. Here we propose a mathematically tractable model of both synchronous spike-evoked release and asynchronous release that permits us to quantify the information conveyed by a synapse. The model transits between discrete states of a communication channel, with the present state depending on many past time steps, emulating the gradual depression and exponential recovery of the synapse. Asynchronous and spontaneous releases play a critical role in shaping the information efficacy of the synapse. We prove that depression can enhance both the information rate and the information rate per unit energy expended, provided that synchronous spike-evoked release depresses less (or recovers faster) than asynchronous release. Furthermore, we explore the theoretical implications of short-term synaptic depression adapting on longer time scales, as part of the phenomenon of metaplasticity. In particular, we show that a synapse can adjust its energy expenditure by changing the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression without affecting the net information conveyed by each successful release. Moreover, the optimal input spike rate is independent of the amplitude or time constant of synaptic depression. We analyze the information efficacy of three types of synapses for which the short-term dynamics of both synchronous and asynchronous release have been experimentally measured. In hippocampal autaptic synapses, the persistence of asynchronous release during depression cannot compensate for the reduction of synchronous release, so that the rate of information transmission declines with synaptic depression. In the calyx of Held, the information rate per release remains constant despite large variations in the measured asynchronous release rate. Lastly, we show that dopamine, by controlling asynchronous release in corticostriatal synapses, increases the synaptic information efficacy in nucleus accumbens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vhPcXTPWKXs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Global analysis of N6-methyladenosine functions and its disease association using deep learning and network-based methods</title>

N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) is the most abundant methylation, existing in &amp;gt;25% of human mRNAs. Exciting recent discoveries indicate the close involvement of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in regulating many different aspects of mRNA metabolism and diseases like cancer. However, our current knowledge about how m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels are controlled and whether and how regulation of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels of a specific gene can play a role in cancer and other diseases is mostly elusive. We propose in this paper a computational scheme for predicting m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-regulated genes and m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-associated disease, which includes Deep-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, the first model for detecting condition-specific m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites from MeRIP-Seq data with a single base resolution using deep learning and Hot-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, a new network-based pipeline that prioritizes functional significant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A genes and its associated diseases using the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and gene-disease heterogeneous networks. We applied Deep-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A and this pipeline to 75 MeRIP-seq human samples, which produced a compact set of 709 functionally significant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-regulated genes and nine functionally enriched subnetworks. The functional enrichment analysis of these genes and networks reveal that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A targets key genes of many critical biological processes including transcription, cell organization and transport, and cell proliferation and cancer-related pathways such as Wnt pathway. The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-associated disease analysis prioritized five significantly associated diseases including leukemia and renal cell carcinoma. These results demonstrate the power of our proposed computational scheme and provide new leads for understanding m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A regulatory functions and its roles in diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tnIdvfV3wQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of the cellular microenvironment as a regulator of phenotypic and functional cellular responses to perturbations. We have previously developed cell patterning techniques to control population context parameters, and here we demonstrate context-explorer (CE), a software tool to improve investigation cell fate acquisitions through community level analyses. We demonstrate the capabilities of CE in the analysis of human and mouse pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs, mPSCs) patterned in colonies of defined geometries in multi-well plates. CE employs a density-based clustering algorithm to identify cell colonies. Using this automatic colony classification methodology, we reach accuracies comparable to manual colony counts in a fraction of the time, both in micropatterned and unpatterned wells. Classifying cells according to their relative position within a colony enables statistical analysis of spatial organization in protein expression within colonies. When applied to colonies of hPSCs, our analysis reveals a radial gradient in the expression of the transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4. We extend these analyses to colonies of different sizes and shapes and demonstrate how the metrics derived by CE can be used to asses the patterning fidelity of micropatterned plates. We have incorporated a number of features to enhance the usability and utility of CE. To appeal to a broad scientific community, all of the software’s functionality is accessible from a graphical user interface, and convenience functions for several common data operations are included. CE is compatible with existing image analysis programs such as CellProfiler and extends the analytical capabilities already provided by these tools. Taken together, CE facilitates investigation of spatially heterogeneous cell populations for fundamental research and drug development validation programs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZCy9eTHmCXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structure, Activity and Function of a Singing CPG Interneuron Controlling Cricket Species-Specific Acoustic Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/96?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of species-specific song patterns is a driving force in the speciation of acoustic communicating insects. It must be closely linked to adaptations of the neuronal network controlling the underlying singing motor activity. What are the cellular and network properties that allow generating different songs? In five cricket species, we analyzed the structure and activity of the identified abdominal ascending opener interneuron, a homologous key component of the singing central pattern generator. The structure of the interneuron, based on the position of the cell body, ascending axon, dendritic arborization pattern, and dye coupling, is highly similar across species. The neuron's spike activity shows a tight coupling to the singing motor activity. In all species, current injection into the interneuron drives artificial song patterns, highlighting the key functional role of this neuron. However, the pattern of the membrane depolarization during singing, the fine dendritic and axonal ramifications, and the number of dye-coupled neurons indicate species-specific adaptations of the neuronal network that might be closely linked to the evolution of species-specific singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question in evolutionary neuroscience is how species-specific behaviors arise in closely related species. We demonstrate behavioral, neurophysiological, and morphological evidence for homology of one key identified interneuron of the singing central pattern generator in five cricket species. Across-species differences of this interneuron are also observed, which might be important to the generation of the species-specific song patterns. This work offers a comprehensive and detailed comparative analysis addressing the neuronal basis of species-specific behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Molecular Fingerprinting of On-Off Direction-Selective Retinal Ganglion Cells Across Species and Relevance to Primate Visual Circuits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/78?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/78?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to detect moving objects is an ethologically salient function. Direction-selective neurons have been identified in the retina, thalamus, and cortex of many species, but their homology has remained unclear. For instance, it is unknown whether direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) exist in primates and, if so, whether they are the equivalent to mouse and rabbit DSGCs. Here, we used a molecular/circuit approach in both sexes to address these issues. In mice, we identify the transcription factor Satb2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) as a selective marker for three RGC types: On–Off DSGCs encoding motion in either the anterior or posterior direction, a newly identified type of Off-DSGC, and an Off-sustained RGC type. In rabbits, we find that expression of Satb2 is conserved in On–Off DSGCs; however, it has evolved to include On–Off DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion in addition to anterior and posterior motion. Next, we show that macaque RGCs express Satb2 most likely in a single type. We used rabies virus-based circuit-mapping tools to reveal the identity of macaque Satb2-RGCs and discovered that their dendritic arbors are relatively large and monostratified. Together, these data indicate Satb2-expressing On–Off DSGCs are likely not present in the primate retina. Moreover, if DSGCs are present in the primate retina, it is unlikely that they express Satb2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to detect object motion is a fundamental feature of almost all visual systems. Here, we identify a novel marker for retinal ganglion cells encoding directional motion that is evolutionarily conserved in mice and rabbits, but not in primates. We show in macaque monkeys that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that express this marker comprise a single type and are morphologically distinct from mouse and rabbit direction-selective RGCs. Our findings indicate that On–Off direction-selective retinal neurons may have evolutionarily diverged in primates and more generally provide novel insight into the identity and organization of primate parallel visual pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glial Sulfatides and Neuronal Complex Gangliosides Are Functionally Interdependent in Maintaining Myelinating Axon Integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/63?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/63?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sulfatides and gangliosides are raft-associated glycolipids essential for maintaining myelinated nerve integrity. Mice deficient in sulfatide (cerebroside sulfotransferase knock-out, &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) or complex gangliosides (β-1,4-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylegalactosaminyltransferase1 knock-out, &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) display prominent disorganization of proteins at the node of Ranvier (NoR) in early life and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Loss of neuronal rather than glial complex gangliosides underpins the &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype, as shown by neuron- or glial-specific rescue, whereas sulfatide is principally expressed and functional in glial membranes. The similarities in NoR phenotype of &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;, and axo–glial protein-deficient mice suggests that these glycolipids stabilize membrane proteins including neurofascin155 (NF155) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at axo–glial junctions. To assess the functional interactions between sulfatide and gangliosides, &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; genotypes were interbred. &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice develop normally to postnatal day 10 (P10), but all die between P20 and P25, coinciding with peak myelination. Ultrastructural, immunohistological, and biochemical analysis of either sex revealed widespread axonal degeneration and disruption to the axo–glial junction at the NoR. In addition to sulfatide-dependent loss of NF155, &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited a major reduction in MAG protein levels in CNS myelin compared with WT and single-lipid-deficient mice. The &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; &lt;i&gt;GalNAc-T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype was fully restored to that of &lt;i&gt;CST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice by neuron-specific expression of complex gangliosides, but not by their glial-specific expression nor by the global expression of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-series gangliosides. These data indicate that sulfatide and complex &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-series gangliosides on the glial and neuronal membranes, respectively, act in concert to promote NF155 and MAG in maintaining the stable axo–glial interactions essential for normal nerve function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sulfatides and complex gangliosides are membrane glycolipids with important roles in maintaining nervous system integrity. Node of Ranvier maintenance in particular requires stable compartmentalization of multiple membrane proteins. The axo–glial adhesion molecules neurofascin155 (NF155) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) require membrane microdomains containing either sulfatides or complex gangliosides to localize and function effectively. The cooperative roles of these microdomains and associated proteins are unknown. Here, we show vital interdependent roles for sulfatides and complex gangliosides because double (but not single) deficiency causes a rapidly lethal phenotype at an early age. These findings suggest that sulfatides and complex gangliosides on opposing axo–glial membranes are responsible for essential tethering of the axo–glial junction proteins NF155 and MAG, which interact to maintain the nodal complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Transcriptional Regulator SnoN Promotes the Proliferation of Cerebellar Granule Neuron Precursors in the Postnatal Mouse Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/44?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Control of neuronal precursor cell proliferation is essential for normal brain development, and deregulation of this fundamental developmental event contributes to brain diseases. Typically, neuronal precursor cell proliferation extends over long periods of time during brain development. However, how neuronal precursor proliferation is regulated in a temporally specific manner remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that conditional KO of the transcriptional regulator SnoN in cerebellar granule neuron precursors robustly inhibits the proliferation of these cells and promotes their cell cycle exit at later stages of cerebellar development in the postnatal male and female mouse brain. In laser capture microdissection followed by RNA-Seq, designed to profile gene expression specifically in the external granule layer of the cerebellum, we find that SnoN promotes the expression of cell proliferation genes and concomitantly represses differentiation genes in granule neuron precursors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Remarkably, bioinformatics analyses reveal that SnoN-regulated genes contain binding sites for the transcription factors N-myc and Pax6, which promote the proliferation and differentiation of granule neuron precursors, respectively. Accordingly, we uncover novel physical interactions of SnoN with N-myc and Pax6 in cells. In behavior analyses, conditional KO of SnoN impairs cerebellar-dependent learning in a delayed eye-blink conditioning paradigm, suggesting that SnoN-regulation of granule neuron precursor proliferation bears functional consequences at the organismal level. Our findings define a novel function and mechanism for the major transcriptional regulator SnoN in the control of granule neuron precursor proliferation in the mammalian brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reports the discovery that the transcriptional regulator SnoN plays a crucial role in the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors in the postnatal mouse brain. Conditional KO of SnoN in granule neuron precursors robustly inhibits the proliferation of these cells and promotes their cycle exit specifically at later stages of cerebellar development, with biological consequences of impaired cerebellar-dependent learning. Genomics and bioinformatics analyses reveal that SnoN promotes the expression of cell proliferation genes and concomitantly represses cell differentiation genes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Although SnoN has been implicated in distinct aspects of the development of postmitotic neurons, this study identifies a novel function for SnoN in neuronal precursors in the mammalian brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Cognitive Thalamus as a Gateway to Mental Representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/3?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/3?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, the thalamus has been viewed as little more than a relay, simply transferring information to key players of the cast, the cortex and hippocampus, without providing any unique functional contribution. In recent years, evidence from multiple laboratories researching different thalamic nuclei has contradicted this idea of the thalamus as a passive structure. Dated models of thalamic functions are being pushed aside, revealing a greater and far more complex contribution of the thalamus for cognition. In this &lt;i&gt;Viewpoints&lt;/i&gt; article, we show how recent data support novel views of thalamic functions that emphasize integrative roles in cognition, ranging from learning and memory to flexible adaption. We propose that these apparently separate cognitive functions may indeed be supported by a more general role in shaping mental representations. Several features of thalamocortical circuits are consistent with this suggested role, and we highlight how divergent and convergent thalamocortical and corticothalamic pathways may complement each other to support these functions. Furthermore, the role of the thalamus for subcortical integration is highlighted as a key mechanism for maintaining and updating representations. Finally, we discuss future areas of research and stress the importance of incorporating new experimental findings into existing knowledge to continue developing thalamic models. The presence of thalamic pathology in a number of neurological conditions reinforces the need to better understand the role of this region in cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal hyperexcitability is one of the major characteristics of fragile X syndrome (FXS), yet the molecular mechanisms of this critical dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here we report a major role of voltage-independent potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-channel dysfunction in hyperexcitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) mice. We observed a reduction of voltage-independent small conductance calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (SK) currents in both male and female mice, leading to decreased action potential (AP) threshold and reduced medium afterhyperpolarization. These SK-channel-dependent deficits led to markedly increased AP firing and abnormal input–output signal transmission of CA3 pyramidal neurons. The SK-current defect was mediated, at least in part, by loss of FMRP interaction with the SK channels (specifically the SK2 isoform), without changes in channel expression. Intracellular application of selective SK-channel openers or a genetic reintroduction of an N-terminal FMRP fragment lacking the ability to associate with polyribosomes normalized all observed excitability defects in CA3 pyramidal neurons of &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. These results suggest that dysfunction of voltage-independent SK channels is the primary cause of CA3 neuronal hyperexcitability in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice and support the critical translation-independent role for the fragile X mental retardation protein as a regulator of neural excitability. Our findings may thus provide a new avenue to ameliorate hippocampal excitability defects in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite two decades of research, no effective treatment is currently available for fragile X syndrome (FXS). Neuronal hyperexcitability is widely considered one of the hallmarks of FXS. Excitability research in the FXS field has thus far focused primarily on voltage-gated ion channels, while contributions from voltage-independent channels have been largely overlooked. Here we report that voltage-independent small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK)-channel dysfunction causes hippocampal neuron hyperexcitability in the FXS mouse model. Our results support the idea that translation-independent function of fragile X mental retardation protein has a major role in regulating ion-channel activity, specifically the SK channels, in hyperexcitability defects in FXS. Our findings may thus open a new direction to ameliorate hippocampal excitability defects in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An Alternative Exon of CAPS2 Influences Catecholamine Loading into LDCVs of Chromaffin Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/18?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The calcium-dependent activator proteins for secretion (CAPS) are priming factors for synaptic and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), promoting their entry into and stabilizing the release-ready state. A modulatory role of CAPS in catecholamine loading of vesicles has been suggested. Although an influence of CAPS on monoamine transporter function and on vesicle acidification has been reported, a role of CAPS in vesicle loading is disputed. Using expression of naturally occurring splice variants of CAPS2 into chromaffin cells from CAPS1/CAPS2 double-deficient mice of both sexes, we show that an alternative exon of 40 aa is responsible for enhanced catecholamine loading of LDCVs in mouse chromaffin cells. The presence of this exon leads to increased activity of both vesicular monoamine transporters. Deletion of CAPS does not alter acidification of vesicles. Our results establish a splice-variant-dependent modulatory effect of CAPS on catecholamine content in LDCVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The calcium activator protein for secretion (CAPS) promotes and stabilizes the entry of catecholamine-containing vesicles of the adrenal gland into a release-ready state. Expression of an alternatively spliced exon in CAPS leads to enhanced catecholamine content in chromaffin granules. This exon codes for 40 aa with a high proline content, consistent with an unstructured loop present in the portion of the molecule generally thought to be involved in vesicle priming. CAPS variants containing this exon promote serotonin uptake into Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either vesicular monoamine transporter. Epigenetic tuning of CAPS variants may allow modulation of endocrine adrenaline and noradrenaline release. This mechanism may extend to monoamine release in central neurons or in the enteric nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CTCF Governs the Identity and Migration of MGE-Derived Cortical Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/177?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a central regulator of chromatin topology recently linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to identify novel roles of CTCF in the developing mouse brain. We provide evidence that CTCF is required for the expression of the LIM homeodomain factor LHX6 involved in fate determination of cortical interneurons (CINs) that originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Conditional &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; ablation in the MGE of mice of either sex leads to delayed tangential migration, abnormal distribution of CIN in the neocortex, a marked reduction of CINs expressing parvalbumin and somatostatin (Sst), and an increased number of MGE-derived cells expressing &lt;i&gt;Lhx8&lt;/i&gt; and other markers of basal forebrain projection neurons. Likewise, &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt;-null MGE cells transplanted into the cortex of wild-type hosts generate fewer Sst-expressing CINs and exhibit lamination defects that are efficiently rescued upon reexpression of LHX6. Collectively, these data indicate that CTCF regulates the dichotomy between &lt;i&gt;Lhx6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lhx8&lt;/i&gt; to achieve correct specification and migration of MGE-derived CINs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work provides evidence that CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) controls an early fate decision point in the generation of cortical interneurons mediated at least in part by Lhx6. Importantly, the abnormalities described could reflect early molecular and cellular events that contribute to human neurological disorders previously linked to CTCF, including schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Computing Value from Quality and Quantity in Human Decision-Making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/163?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/163?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How organisms learn the value of single stimuli through experience is well described. In many decisions, however, value estimates are computed &quot;on the fly&quot; by combining multiple stimulus attributes. The neural basis of this computation is poorly understood. Here we explore a common scenario in which decision-makers must combine information about quality and quantity to determine the best option. Using fMRI, we examined the neural representation of quality, quantity, and their integration into an integrated subjective value signal in humans of both genders. We found that activity within inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) correlated with offer quality, while activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) specifically correlated with offer quantity. Several brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), were sensitive to an interaction of quality and quantity. However, the ACC was uniquely activated by quality, quantity, and their interaction, suggesting that this region provides a substrate for flexible computation of value from both quality and quantity. Furthermore, ACC signals across subjects correlated with the strength of quality and quantity signals in IFG and IPS, respectively. ACC tracking of subjective value also correlated with choice predictability. Finally, activity in the ACC was elevated for choice trials, suggesting that ACC provides a nexus for the computation of subjective value in multiattribute decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Would you prefer three apples or two oranges? Many choices we make each day require us to weigh up the quality and quantity of different outcomes. Using fMRI, we show that option quality is selectively represented in the inferior frontal gyrus, while option quantity correlates with areas of the intraparietal sulcus that have previously been associated with numerical processing. We show that information about the two is integrated into a value signal in the anterior cingulate cortex, and the fidelity of this integration predicts choice predictability. Our results demonstrate how on-the-fly value estimates are computed from multiple attributes in human value-based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Relationship between Age, Neural Differentiation, and Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/149?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is associated with decreased neural selectivity (dedifferentiation) in category-selective cortical regions. This finding has prompted the suggestion that dedifferentiation contributes to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with this possibility, dedifferentiation has been reported to negatively correlate with fluid intelligence in older adults. Here, we examined whether dedifferentiation is associated with performance in another cognitive domain—episodic memory—that is also highly vulnerable to aging. Given the proposed role of dedifferentiation in age-related cognitive decline, we predicted there would be a stronger link between dedifferentiation and episodic memory performance in older than in younger adults. Young (18–30 years) and older (64–75 years) male and female humans underwent fMRI scanning while viewing images of objects and scenes before a subsequent recognition memory test. We computed a differentiation index in two regions of interest (ROIs): parahippocampal place area (PPA) and lateral occipital complex (LOC). This index quantified the selectivity of the BOLD response to preferred versus nonpreferred category of an ROI (scenes for PPA, objects for LOC). The differentiation index in the PPA, but not the LOC, was lower in older than in younger adults. Additionally, the PPA differentiation index predicted recognition memory performance for the studied items. This relationship was independent of and not moderated by age. The PPA differentiation index also predicted performance on a latent &quot;fluency&quot; factor derived from a neuropsychological test battery; this relationship was also age invariant. These findings suggest that two independent factors, one associated with age, and the other with cognitive performance, influence neural differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aging is associated with neural dedifferentiation—reduced neural selectivity in &quot;category-selective&quot; cortical brain regions—which has been proposed to contribute to cognitive aging. Here, we examined whether neural differentiation is predictive of episodic memory performance, and whether the relationship is moderated by age. A neural differentiation index was estimated for scene-selective (PPA) and object-selective (LOC) cortical regions while participants studied images for a subsequent memory test. Age-related reductions were observed for the PPA, but not for the LOC, differentiation index. Importantly, the PPA differentiation index demonstrated age-invariant correlations with subsequent memory performance and a fluency factor derived from a neuropsychological battery. Together, these findings suggest that neural differentiation is associated with two independent factors: age and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Social Brain Automatically Predicts Others' Future Mental States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/140?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/140?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social life requires people to predict the future: people must anticipate others' thoughts, feelings, and actions to interact with them successfully. The theory of predictive coding suggests that the social brain may meet this need by automatically predicting others' social futures. If so, when representing others' current mental state, the brain should already start representing their future states. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to measure female and male human participants' neural representations of mental states. Representational similarity analysis revealed that neural patterns associated with mental states currently under consideration resembled patterns of likely future states more so than patterns of unlikely future states. This effect manifested in activity across the social brain network and in medial prefrontal cortex in particular. Repetition suppression analysis also supported the social predictive coding hypothesis: considering mental states presented in predictable sequences reduced activity in the precuneus relative to unpredictable sequences. In addition to demonstrating that the brain makes automatic predictions of others' social futures, the results also demonstrate that the brain leverages a 3D representational space to make these predictions. Proximity between mental states on the psychological dimensions of rationality, social impact, and valence explained much of the association between state-specific neural pattern similarity and state transition likelihood. Together, these findings suggest that the way the brain represents the social present gives people an automatic glimpse of the social future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When you see a ball in flight, your brain calculates, not just its static visual features such as size and shape, but also predicts its future trajectory. Here, we investigated whether the same might hold true in the social world: when we see someone flying into a rage, does our brain automatically predict their social trajectory? In this study, we scanned participants' brain activity while they judged others' mental states. We found that neural activity associated with a given state resembled activity associated with likely future states. Additionally, unpredictable sequences of states evoked more brain activity than predictable sequences, consistent with monitoring for, and updating from, prediction errors. These results suggest that the social brain automatically predicts others' future mental states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/125?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory perception depends on neocortical computations that contextually adjust sensory signals in different internal and environmental contexts. Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is the main target of cortical and subcortical inputs that provide &quot;top-down&quot; information for context-dependent sensory processing. Although L1 is devoid of excitatory cells, it contains the distal &quot;tuft&quot; dendrites of pyramidal cells (PCs) located in deeper layers. L1 also contains a poorly characterized population of GABAergic interneurons (INs), which regulate the impact that different top-down inputs have on PCs. A poor comprehension of L1 IN subtypes and how they affect PC activity has hampered our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie contextual modulation of sensory processing. We used novel genetic strategies in male and female mice combined with electrophysiological and morphological methods to help resolve differences that were unclear when using only electrophysiological and/or morphological approaches. We discovered that L1 contains four distinct populations of INs, each with a unique molecular profile, morphology, and electrophysiology, including a previously overlooked IN population (named here &quot;canopy cells&quot;) representing 40% of L1 INs. In contrast to what is observed in other layers, most L1 neurons appear to be unique to the layer, highlighting the specialized character of the signal processing that takes place in L1. This new understanding of INs in L1, as well as the application of genetic methods based on the markers described here, will enable investigation of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of top-down processing in L1 with unprecedented detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is the main target of corticocortical and subcortical projections that mediate top-down or context-dependent sensory perception. However, this unique layer is often referred to as &quot;enigmatic&quot; because its neuronal composition has been difficult to determine. Using a combination of genetic, electrophysiological, and morphological approaches that helped to resolve differences that were unclear when using a single approach, we were able to decipher the neuronal composition of L1. We identified markers that distinguish L1 neurons and found that the layer contains four populations of GABAergic interneurons, each with unique molecular profiles, morphologies, and electrophysiological properties. These findings provide a new framework for studying the circuit mechanisms underlying the processing of top-down inputs in neocortical L1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Transfer Characteristics of Hair Cells Encoding Mechanical Stimuli in the Lateral Line of Zebrafish</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/112?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/112?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hair cells transmit mechanical information by converting deflection of the hair bundle into synaptic release of glutamate. We have investigated this process in the lateral line of larval zebrafish (male and female) to understand how stimuli are encoded within a neuromast. Using multiphoton microscopy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we imaged synaptic release of glutamate using the reporter iGluSnFR as well as deflections of the cupula. We found that the neuromast is composed of a functionally diverse population of hair cells. Half the hair cells signaled cupula motion in both directions from rest, either by increasing glutamate release in response to a deflection in the positive direction or by reducing release in the negative direction. The relationship between cupula deflection and glutamate release demonstrated maximum sensitivity at displacements of just ~40 nm in the positive direction. The remaining hair cells only signaled motion in one direction and were less sensitive, extending the operating range of the neuromast beyond 1 μm. Adaptation of the synaptic output was also heterogeneous, with some hair cells generating sustained glutamate release in response to a steady deflection of the cupula and others generating transient outputs. Finally, a distinct signal encoded a return of the cupula to rest: a large and transient burst of glutamate release from hair cells unresponsive to the initial stimulus. A population of hair cells with these different sensitivities, operating ranges, and adaptive properties will allow the neuromast to encode weak stimuli while maintaining the dynamic range to signal the amplitude and duration of stronger deflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hair cells transmit information about mechanical stimuli by converting very small deflections of their hair bundle into changes in the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. We have measured this input/output relation in the live fish using a fluorescent protein and find that different hair cells vary in their mechanical sensitivity and the time course of their response. These variations will allow the fish to sense the timing and duration of both very weak stimuli (~40 nm deflections) and strong stimuli (~1 μm), underlying the ability of the fish to avoid predators and maintain its body position in flowing water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A companion paper introduces a nonlinear network with Hebbian excitatory (E)
neurons that are reciprocally coupled with anti-Hebbian inhibitory (I) neurons
and also receive Hebbian feedforward excitation from sensory (S) afferents. The
present paper derives the network from two normative principles that are
mathematically equivalent but conceptually different. The first principle
formulates unsupervised learning as a constrained optimization problem:
maximization of S-E correlations subject to a copositivity constraint on E-E
correlations. A combination of Legendre and Lagrangian duality yields a
zero-sum continuous game between excitatory and inhibitory connections that is
solved by the neural network. The second principle defines a zero-sum game
between E and I cells. E cells want to maximize S-E correlations and minimize
E-I correlations, while I cells want to maximize I-E correlations and minimize
power. The conflict between I and E objectives effectively forces the E cells
to decorrelate from each other, although only incompletely. Legendre duality
yields the neural network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many systems we can describe emergent macroscopic behaviors,
quantitatively, using models that are much simpler than the underlying
microscopic interactions; we understand the success of this simplification
through the renormalization group. Could similar simplifications succeed in
complex biological systems? We develop explicit coarse-graining procedures that
we apply to experimental data on the electrical activity in large populations
of neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Probability distributions of
coarse-grained variables seem to approach a fixed non-Gaussian form, and we see
evidence of power-law dependencies in both static and dynamic quantities as we
vary the coarse-graining scale over two decades. Taken together, these results
suggest that the collective behavior of the network is described by a
non-trivial fixed point.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many organisms, from flies to humans, use visual signals to estimate their
motion through the world. To explore the motion estimation problem, we have
constructed a camera/gyroscope system that allows us to sample, at high
temporal resolution, the joint distribution of input images and rotational
motions during a long walk in the woods. From these data we construct the
optimal estimator of velocity based on spatial and temporal derivatives of
image intensity in small patches of the visual world. Over the bulk of the
naturally occurring dynamic range, the optimal estimator exhibits the same
systematic errors seen in neural and behavioral responses, including the
confounding of velocity and contrast. These results suggest that apparent
errors of sensory processing may reflect an optimal response to the physical
signals in the environment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11758</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How does the size of a neural circuit influence its learning performance?
Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with
the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species
with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding
connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve
more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting
where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal
size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows
how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more
learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to
generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster
and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size,
the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning
performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the
need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some
neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our
analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental
relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and
intrinsic noise in neural circuits.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Asymptotic and numerical analysis of a stochastic PDE model of volume transmission. (arXiv:1812.11680v1 [math.PR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11680</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11680</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Volume transmission is an important neural communication pathway in which
neurons in one brain region influence the neurotransmitter concentration in the
extracellular space of a distant brain region. In this paper, we apply
asymptotic analysis to a stochastic partial differential equation model of
volume transmission to calculate the neurotransmitter concentration in the
extracellular space. Our model involves the diffusion equation in a
three-dimensional domain with interior holes that randomly switch between being
either sources or sinks. These holes model nerve varicosities that alternate
between releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire
action potentials. In the case that the holes are small, we compute
analytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the
average neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the
concentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is
independent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first
term is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural
firing correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The
second term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order.
Interestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild
assumptions. We verify our asymptotic results by high-order numerical
simulation using radial basis function-generated finite differences.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11581</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11581</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a rate-based nonlinear neural network in which
excitatory (E) neurons receive feedforward excitation from sensory (S) neurons,
and inhibit each other through disynaptic pathways mediated by inhibitory (I)
interneurons. Correlation-based plasticity of disynaptic inhibition serves to
incompletely decorrelate E neuron activity, pushing the E neurons to learn
distinct sensory features. The plasticity equations additionally contain
&quot;extra&quot; terms fostering competition between excitatory synapses converging onto
the same postsynaptic neuron and inhibitory synapses diverging from the same
presynaptic neuron. The parameters of competition between S$\to$E connections
can be adjusted to make learned features look more like &quot;parts&quot; or &quot;wholes.&quot;
The parameters of competition between I-E connections can be adjusted to set
the typical decorrelatedness and sparsity of E neuron activity. Numerical
simulations of unsupervised learning show that relatively few I neurons can be
sufficient for achieving good decorrelation, and increasing the number of I
neurons makes decorrelation more complete. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to
active E neurons are approximately balanced as a result of learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The construction of biologically plausible models of neural circuits is
crucial for understanding the computational properties of the nervous system.
Constructing functional networks composed of separate excitatory and inhibitory
neurons obeying Dale's law presents a number of challenges. We show how a
target-based approach, when combined with a fast online constrained
optimization technique, is capable of building functional models of rate and
spiking recurrent neural networks in which excitation and inhibition are
balanced. Balanced networks can be trained to produce complicated temporal
patterns and to solve input-output tasks while retaining biologically desirable
features such as Dale's law and response variability.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Scene complexity modulates degree of feedback activity during object detection in natural scenes</title>

Selective brain responses to objects arise within a few hundreds of milliseconds of neural processing, suggesting that visual object recognition is mediated by rapid feed-forward activations. Yet disruption of neural responses in early visual cortex beyond feed-forward processing stages affects object recognition performance. Here, we unite these discrepant findings by reporting that object recognition involves enhanced feedback activity (recurrent processing within early visual cortex) when target objects are embedded in natural scenes that are characterized by high complexity. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on natural scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was selectively enhanced for high complexity scenes. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was enhanced for target objects in scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by target objects were selectively enhanced at feedback stages of visual processing (from ~220 ms onwards) for high complexity scenes only. Third, behavioral performance for high complexity scenes deteriorated when participants were pressed for time and thus less able to incorporate the feedback activity. Modeling of the reaction time distributions using drift diffusion revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes, with evidence accumulation being coupled to trial-to-trial variation in the EEG feedback response. Together, these results suggest that while feed-forward activity may suffice to recognize isolated objects, the brain employs recurrent processing more adaptively in naturalistic settings, using minimal feedback for simple scenes and increasing feedback for complex scenes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bWxjgjN2aIw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exploring chromatin hierarchical organization via Markov State Modelling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhen Wah Tan, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a new computational method for exploring chromatin structural organization based on Markov State Modelling of Hi-C data, represented as an interaction network between genomic loci. A Markov process describes the random walk of a traveling probe in the corresponding energy landscape, mimicking the motion of a biomolecule involved in chromatin function. By studying the metastability of the associated Markov State Model upon annealing, the hierarchical structure of individual chromosomes is observed, and a corresponding set of structural partitions is identified at each level of hierarchy. Then, the notion of effective interaction between partitions is derived, delineating the overall topology and architecture of chromosomes. Mapping epigenetic data on the graphs of intra-chromosomal effective interactions helps in understanding how chromosome organization facilitates its function. A sketch of whole-genome interactions obtained from the analysis of 539 partitions from all 23 chromosomes, complemented by distributions of gene expression regulators and epigenetic factors, sheds light on the structure-function relationships in chromatin, delineating chromosomal territories, as well as structural partitions analogous to topologically associating domains and active / passive epigenomic compartments. In addition to the overall genome architecture shown by effective interactions, the affinity between partitions of different chromosomes was analyzed as an indicator of the degree of association between partitions in functionally relevant genomic interactions. The overall static picture of whole-genome interactions obtained with the method presented in this work provides a foundation for chromatin structural reconstruction and the modelling of chromatin dynamics to explore the regulation of genome function. The algorithms used in this study are implemented in a freely available Python package ChromaWalker (https://bitbucket.org/ZhenWahTan/chromawalker).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDKSI-jH4_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Pavlovian influences are important in guiding decision-making across health and psychopathology. There is an increasing interest in using concise computational tasks to parametrise such influences in large populations, and especially to track their evolution during development and changes in mental health. However, the developmental course of Pavlovian influences is uncertain, a problem compounded by the unclear psychometric properties of the relevant measurements. We assessed Pavlovian influences in a longitudinal sample using a well characterised and widely used Go-NoGo task. We hypothesized that the strength of Pavlovian influences and other ‘psychomarkers’ guiding decision-making would behave like traits. As reliance on Pavlovian influence is not as profitable as precise instrumental decision-making in this Go-NoGo task, we expected this influence to decrease with higher IQ and age. Additionally, we hypothesized it would correlate with expressions of psychopathology. We found that Pavlovian effects had weak temporal stability, while model-fit was more stable. In terms of external validity, Pavlovian effects decreased with increasing IQ and experience within the task, in line with normative expectations. However, Pavlovian effects were poorly correlated with age or psychopathology. Thus, although this computational construct did correlate with important aspects of development, it does not meet conventional requirements for tracking individual development. We suggest measures that might improve psychometric properties of task-derived Pavlovian measures for future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JoPyq3Wkq5c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Chemogenomic model identifies synergistic drug combinations robust to the pathogen microenvironment</title>

Antibiotics need to be effective in diverse environments &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, the pathogen microenvironment can have a significant impact on antibiotic potency. Further, antibiotics are increasingly used in combinations to combat resistance, yet, the effect of microenvironments on drug-combination efficacy is unknown. To exhaustively explore the impact of diverse microenvironments on drug-combinations, here we develop a computational framework—Metabolism And GENomics-based Tailoring of Antibiotic regimens (MAGENTA). MAGENTA uses chemogenomic profiles of individual drugs and metabolic perturbations to predict synergistic or antagonistic drug-interactions in different microenvironments. We uncovered antibiotic combinations with robust synergy across nine distinct environments against both &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and A. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; by searching through 2556 drug-combinations of 72 drugs. MAGENTA also accurately predicted the change in efficacy of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drug-combinations during growth in glycerol media, which we confirmed experimentally in both microbes. Our approach identified genes in glycolysis and glyoxylate pathway as top predictors of synergy and antagonism respectively. Our systems approach enables tailoring of antibiotic therapies based on the pathogen microenvironment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3iooan0rGtE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Statistical investigations of protein residue direct couplings</title>

Protein Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), which predicts residue-residue contacts based on covarying positions within a multiple sequence alignment, has been remarkably effective. This suggests that there is more to learn from sequence correlations than is generally assumed, and calls for deeper investigations into DCA and perhaps into other types of correlations. Here we describe an approach that enables such investigations by measuring, as an estimated &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-value, the statistical significance of the association between residue-residue covariance and structural interactions, either internal or homodimeric. Its application to thirty protein superfamilies confirms that direct coupling (DC) scores correlate with 3D pairwise contacts with very high significance. This method also permits quantitative assessment of the relative performance of alternative DCA methods, and of the degree to which they detect direct versus indirect couplings. We illustrate its use to assess, for a given protein, the biological relevance of alternative conformational states, to investigate the possible mechanistic implications of differences between these states, and to characterize subtle aspects of direct couplings. Our analysis indicates that direct pairwise correlations may be largely distinct from correlated patterns associated with functional specialization, and that the joint analysis of both types of correlations can yield greater power.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in three patients with early‐onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in two patients, and tumour embolization in a third). Our observations provide further &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura, and has diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid–liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer's Disease pathology. We previously showed OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1‐4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: GABAergic transmission underlies interictal epileptogenicity in pediatric FCD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of GABAergic transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human Focal Cortical Dysplasia, focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients operated from a Focal Cortical Dysplasia were performed on Multi Electrode Arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride co‐transporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focal Cortical Dysplasia slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. 36/47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in pro‐epileptic conditions in 6/8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling as a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors blocker stopped them in 2/3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;‐&lt;/sup&gt; co‐transporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9/12 cases, revealing a Cl&lt;sup&gt;‐&lt;/sup&gt; dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 sub‐cellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altered chloride cotransporters expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: In vivo mGluR5 abnormalities localize the epileptogenic zone in mesial TLE</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25404?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) show abnormalities in tissue concentrations of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole‐brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 non‐displaceable binding potentials (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups using region‐of‐interest and whole‐brain voxel‐wise analyses. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (p=0.006). [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Amongst 23/25 operated patients with &amp;gt; 1 year follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia), and showed significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP)‐PET and MRI scans were acquired from 42 healthy older adults (OA; 21 PiB+; age=77.6±4.6; 25F/17M) and 19 PiB+ patients with AD (age=63.1±10.3; 12F/7M) over 1‐3 years follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and crossmodal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percent change (APC) in FTP was also calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multivariate MR Biomarkers Better Predict Cognitive Dysfunction in Mouse Models of Alzheimers Disease. (arXiv:1812.11001v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11001</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11001</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand multifactorial conditions such as Alzheimers disease (AD) we
need brain signatures that predict the impact of multiple pathologies and their
interactions. To help uncover the relationships between brain circuits and
cognitive markers we have used mouse models that represent, at least in part,
the complex interactions altered in AD. In particular, we aimed to understand
the relationship between vulnerable brain circuits and memory deficits measured
in the Morris water maze, and we tested several predictive modeling approaches.
We used in vivo manganese enhanced MRI voxel based analyses to reveal regional
differences in volume (morphometry), signal intensity (activity), and magnetic
susceptibility (iron deposition, demyelination). These regions included the
hippocampus, olfactory areas, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum. The image based
properties of these regions were used to predict spatial memory. We next used
eigenanatomy, which reduces dimensionality to produce sets of regions that
explain the variance in the data. For each imaging marker, eigenanatomy
revealed networks underpinning a range of cognitive functions including memory,
motor function, and associative learning. Finally, the integration of
multivariate markers in a supervised sparse canonical correlation approach
outperformed single predictor models and had significant correlates to spatial
memory. Among a priori selected regions, the fornix also provided good
predictors, raising the possibility of investigating how disease propagation
within brain networks leads to cognitive deterioration. Our results support
that modeling approaches integrating multivariate imaging markers provide
sensitive predictors of AD-like behaviors. Such strategies for mapping brain
circuits responsible for behaviors may help in the future predict disease
progression, or response to interventions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Features and Machine Learning for Correlating and Classifying between Brain Areas and Dyslexia. (arXiv:1812.10622v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10622</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10622</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a method that is based on processing gathered Event Related
Potentials (ERP) signals and the use of machine learning technique for
multivariate analysis (i.e. classification) that we apply in order to analyze
the differences between Dyslexic and Skilled readers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No human intervention is needed in the analysis process. This is the state of
the art results for automatic identification of Dyslexic readers using a
Lexical Decision Task. We use mathematical and machine learning based
techniques to automatically discover novel complex features that (i) allow for
reliable distinction between Dyslexic and Normal Control Skilled readers and
(ii) to validate the assumption that the most of the differences between
Dyslexic and Skilled readers located in the left hemisphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these tools also pointed to the fact that High Pass signals
(typically considered as &quot;noise&quot; during ERP/EEG analyses) in fact contains
significant relevant information. Finally, the proposed scheme can be used for
analysis of any ERP based studies.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Serum Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 as a Biomarker for Incident Dementia: The Hisayama Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,349 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002–2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend &amp;lt; 0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–2.97, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.02–2.55, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04 for AD; HR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.35–6.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk factor subgroups (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for heterogeneity &amp;gt; 0.11).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–12&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Impaired Cognitive Function after Perineuronal Net Degradation in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are highly organized components of the extracellular matrix that surround a subset of mature neurons in the CNS. These structures play a critical role in regulating neuronal plasticity, particularly during neurodevelopment. Consistent with this role, their presence is associated with functional and structural stability of the neurons they ensheath. A loss of PNNs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been suggested to contribute to cognitive impairment in disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the direct consequences of PNN loss in medial PFC (mPFC) on cognition has not been demonstrated. Here, we examined behavior after disruption of PNNs in mPFC of Long–Evans rats following injection of the enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC). Our data show that ChABC-treated animals were impaired on tests of object oddity perception. Performance in the cross-modal object recognition (CMOR) task was not significantly different for ChABC-treated rats, although ChABC-treated rats were not able to perform above chance levels whereas control rats were. ChABC-treated animals were not significantly different from controls on tests of prepulse inhibition (PPI), set-shifting (SS), reversal learning, or tactile and visual object recognition memory. Posthumous immunohistochemistry confirmed significantly reduced PNNs in mPFC due to ChABC treatment. Moreover, PNN density in the mPFC predicted performance on the oddity task, where higher PNN density was associated with better performance. These findings suggest that PNN loss within the mPFC impairs some aspects of object oddity perception and recognition and that PNNs contribute to cognitive function in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Stroke Recovery in Rats after 24‐Hour–Delayed Intramuscular Neurotrophin‐3 Infusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25386?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25386?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophin‐3 (NT3) plays a key role in the development and function of locomotor circuits including descending serotonergic and corticospinal tract axons and afferents from muscle and skin. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into affected forelimb muscles improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move toward the clinic, we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats received unilateral ischemic stroke in sensorimotor cortex. To simulate a clinically feasible time to treatment, 24 hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into affected triceps brachii for 4 weeks using implanted catheters and minipumps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiolabeled NT3 crossed from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in rodents with or without strokes. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory impairment of the affected wrist. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation of the affected wrist showed spontaneous recovery of peri‐infarct blood oxygenation level–dependent signal that NT3 did not further enhance. Rather, NT3 induced neuroplasticity of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of NT3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Chirality provides a direct fitness advantage and facilitates intermixing in cellular aggregates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ashish B. George, Kirill S. Korolev&lt;/p&gt;

Chirality in shape and motility can evolve rapidly in microbes and cancer cells. To determine how chirality affects cell fitness, we developed a model of chiral growth in compact aggregates such as microbial colonies and solid tumors. Our model recapitulates previous experimental findings and shows that mutant cells can invade by increasing their chirality or switching their handedness. The invasion results either in a takeover or stable coexistence between the mutant and the ancestor depending on their relative chirality. For large chiralities, the coexistence is accompanied by strong intermixing between the cells, while spatial segregation occurs otherwise. We show that the competition within the aggregate is mediated by bulges in regions where the cells with different chiralities meet. The two-way coupling between aggregate shape and natural selection is described by the chiral Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation coupled to the Burgers’ equation with multiplicative noise. We solve for the key features of this theory to explain the origin of selection on chirality. Overall, our work suggests that chirality could be an important ecological trait that mediates competition, invasion, and spatial structure in cellular populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SwZSibGFqoA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Active degradation of MarA controls coordination of its downstream targets</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas A. Rossi, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Mary J. Dunlop&lt;/p&gt;

Several key transcription factors have unusually short half-lives compared to other cellular proteins. Here, we explore the utility of active degradation in shaping how the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA coordinates its downstream targets. MarA controls a variety of stress response genes in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We modify its half-life either by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPRi or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. Our experimental and analytical results indicate that active degradation can impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. In the context of multi-gene regulation, trade-offs between these properties show that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UhXoetl4a4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

An ongoing challenge in protein chemistry is to identify the underlying interaction energies that capture protein dynamics. The traditional trade-off in biomolecular simulation between accuracy and computational efficiency is predicated on the assumption that detailed force fields are typically well-parameterized, obtaining a significant fraction of possible accuracy. We re-examine this trade-off in the more realistic regime in which parameterization is a greater source of error than the level of detail in the force field. To address parameterization of coarse-grained force fields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train from simulations of 450 proteins. In our procedure, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through the precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble. This method is applied to our recently developed &lt;i&gt;Upside&lt;/i&gt; model, where the free energy for side chains is rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After this contrastive divergence training, the model is able to &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; fold proteins up to 100 residues on a single core in days. This improved &lt;i&gt;Upside&lt;/i&gt; model provides a starting point both for investigation of folding dynamics and as an inexpensive Bayesian prior for protein physics that can be integrated with additional experimental or bioinformatic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yjHFh9iipWU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As sequencing prices drop, genomic data accumulates—seemingly at a steadily increasing pace. Most genomic data potentially have value beyond the initial purpose—but only if shared with the scientific community. This, of course, is often easier said than done. Some of the challenges in sharing genomic data include data volume (raw file sizes and number of files), complexities, formats, nomenclatures, metadata descriptions, and the choice of a repository. In this paper, we describe 10 quick tips for sharing open genomic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CRCq9aWfLPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Accurate calculation of side chain packing and free energy with applications to protein molecular dynamics</title>

To address the large gap between time scales that can be easily reached by molecular simulations and those required to understand protein dynamics, we present a rapid self-consistent approximation of the side chain free energy at every integration step. In analogy with the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation for electronic structure, the protein backbone dynamics are simulated as preceding according to the dictates of the free energy of an instantaneously-equilibrated side chain potential. The side chain free energy is computed on the fly, allowing the protein backbone dynamics to traverse a greatly smoothed energetic landscape. This computation results in extremely rapid equilibration and sampling of the Boltzmann distribution. Our method, termed &lt;i&gt;Upside&lt;/i&gt;, employs a reduced model involving the three backbone atoms, along with the carbonyl oxygen and amide proton, and a single (oriented) side chain bead having multiple locations reflecting the conformational diversity of the side chain’s rotameric states. We also introduce a novel, maximum-likelihood method to parameterize the side chain interactions using protein structures. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for predicting &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; rotamer states while consuming only milliseconds of CPU time. Our method enables rapidly equilibrating coarse-grained simulations that can nonetheless contain significant molecular detail. We also show that the resulting free energies of the side chains are sufficiently accurate for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; folding of some proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYlak8hVP-c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Weighted correlated component analysis for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCI. (arXiv:1812.10227v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10227</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Correlated component analysis (CORRCA) is a novel method for frequency
recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based
brain-computer interface (BCI), which holds the potential to implement
high-performance SSVEP-based BCI systems. CORRCA could provide multiple
correlation coefficients to measure the correlation between two signals.
However, only the largest one is selected as feature while ignoring all others
in previous study, which loses the discriminating information. In current
study, we proposed a weighting strategy with nonlinear function to combine all
the correlation coefficients to enhance the performance of CORRCA method.
Extensive experimental results on a benchmark dataset of thirty-five subjects
indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the original CORRCA
method. This study demonstrates that the proposed method could be a good choice
for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCI systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common approach to modeling dynamic connectivity in resting-state
whole-brain fMRI is to compute (across moving temporal windows) the
Pearson-correlation between anatomical regions derived from predefined brain
parcellation. Due to image acquisition and physiological noise, the direct use
of the sample correlation matrices is not reliable for the subsequent modeling
of the dynamically-evolving connectivity matrices. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a new regression approach that smooths out the noise by exploiting
the geometric structure of correlation matrices. We demonstrate that the
proposed method is useful for identifying distinct state spaces in the
resting-state connectivities of males and females through the transition
matrices of the common states.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise is an inherent part of neuronal dynamics, and thus of the brain. It can
be observed in neuronal activity at different spatiotemporal scales, including
in neuronal membrane potentials, local field potentials,
electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. A central research topic in
contemporary neuroscience is to elucidate the functional role of noise in
neuronal information processing. Experimental studies have shown that a
suitable level of noise may enhance the detection of weak neuronal signals by
means of stochastic resonance. In response, theoretical research, based on the
theory of stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical physics,
has made great strides in elucidating the mechanism and the many benefits of
stochastic resonance in neuronal systems. In this perspective, we review recent
research dedicated to neuronal stochastic resonance in biophysical mathematical
models. We also explore the regulation of neuronal stochastic resonance, and we
outline important open questions and directions for future research. A deeper
understanding of neuronal stochastic resonance may afford us new insights into
the highly impressive information processing in the brain.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rapid and flexible learning during behavioral choices is critical to our daily endeavors and constitutes a hallmark of dynamic reasoning. An important paradigm to examine flexible behavior involves learning new arbitrary associations mapping visual inputs to motor outputs. We conjectured that visuomotor rules are instantiated by translating visual signals into actions through dynamic interactions between visual, frontal and motor cortex. We evaluated the neural representation of such visuomotor rules by performing intracranial field potential recordings in epilepsy subjects during a rule-learning delayed match-to-behavior task. Learning new visuomotor mappings led to the emergence of specific responses associating visual signals with motor outputs in 3 anatomical clusters in frontal, anteroventral temporal and posterior parietal cortex. After learning, mapping selective signals during the delay period showed interactions with visual and motor signals. These observations provide initial steps towards elucidating the dynamic circuits underlying flexible behavior and how communication between subregions of frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex leads to rapid learning of task-relevant choices.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The executive control network is involved in the voluntary control of novel and complex situations. Solving conflict situations or detecting errors have demonstrated to impair conscious perception of near-threshold stimuli. The aim of this study was to explore the neural mechanisms underlying executive control and its interaction with conscious perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. To this end, we used a dual-task paradigm involving Stroop and conscious detection tasks with near-threshold stimuli. A set of prefrontal and frontoparietal regions were more strongly engaged for incongruent than congruent trials while a distributed set of frontoparietal regions showed stronger activation for consciously than nonconsciously perceived trials. Functional connectivity analysis revealed an interaction between executive control and conscious perception in frontal and parietal nodes. The microstructural properties of the middle branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus were associated with neural measures of the interaction between executive control and consciousness. These results demonstrate that conscious perception and executive control share neural resources in frontoparietal networks, as proposed by some influential models.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Waves of Maturation and Senescence in Micro-structural MRI Markers of Human Cortical Myelination over the Lifespan</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Seminal human brain histology work has demonstrated developmental waves of myelination. Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker linked to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8–85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of seven cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30-s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50-s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60-s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A likelihood approach to testing hypotheses on the co-evolution of epigenome and genome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Lu, Xiaoyi Cao, Sheng Zhong&lt;/p&gt;

Central questions to epigenome evolution include whether interspecies changes of histone modifications are independent of evolutionary changes of DNA, and if there is dependence whether they depend on any specific types of DNA sequence changes. Here, we present a likelihood approach for testing hypotheses on the co-evolution of genome and histone modifications. The gist of this approach is to convert evolutionary biology hypotheses into probabilistic forms, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications, which we refer to as a class of Joint Evolutionary Model for the Genome and the Epigenome (JEMGE). JEMGE can be summarized as a mixture model of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to underlying sequence substitutions and to underlying sequence insertions and deletions (indels). We implemented a maximum likelihood method to fit the models to the data. Based on comparison of likelihoods, we inferred whether interspecies epigenomic variations depended on substitution or indels in local genomic sequences based on DNase hypersensitivity and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited local-sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Substitutions accounted for less local-sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively. By initiating probabilistic formulation on the co-evolution of genomes and epigenomes, JEMGE helps to bring evolutionary biology principles to comparative epigenomic studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZM4wUNNtaVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cell-type specific changes in intrinsic excitability in the subiculum following learning and exposure to novel environmental contexts</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1, and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, though it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells–but not BS cells– displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures (afterhyperpolarization, input resistance, current required to elicit a spike), with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual fear conditioning followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The subiculum is the main output region of the hippocampus and contains two main neuron types: regular-spiking and burst-spiking. Here, we show that learning and novel context exposure induces plasticity in intrinsic excitability in regular-spiking cells of the subiculum, and that this plasticity predicts degree of learning of contextual fear conditioning. In contrast, we observed no significant learning-induced plasticity in intrinsic properties in subicular burst-spiking cells; however, we did observe an apparent conversion of burst-spiking to regular-spiking as evidenced by a greater proportion of regular-spiking neurons within the subiculum following learning. This suggests that the ratio of regular-spiking to burst-spiking neurons within the subiculum, together with enhanced excitability of regular-spiking neurons, is important in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Prefrontal theta oscillations promote selective encoding of behaviorally relevant events</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The ability to capture the most relevant information from everyday experiences without constantly learning unimportant details is vital to survival and mental health. While decreased activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is associated with failed or inflexible encoding of relevant events in the hippocampus, mechanisms used by the mPFC to discern behavioral relevance of events are not clear. To address this question, we chemogenetically activated excitatory neurons in the mPFC of male rats and examined its impact on local network activity and differential associative learning dependent on the hippocampus. Rats were exposed to two neutral stimuli in two environments whose contingency with an aversive stimulus changed systematically across days. Over two weeks of differential and reversal learning, theta band activity began to ramp up toward the expected onset of the aversive stimulus, and this ramping activity tracked the subsequent shift of the set (stimulus modality to environment) predictive of the aversive stimulus. With chemogenetic mPFC activation, the ramping activity emerged within a few sessions of differential learning, which paralleled faster learning and stronger correlations between the ramping activity and conditioned responses. Chemogenetic mPFC activity, however, did not affect the adjustment of ramping activity or behavior during reversal learning or set-shifting, suggesting that the faster learning was not due to a general enhancement of attention, sensory, or motor processing. Thus, the dynamics of the mPFC network activation during events provide a relevance-signaling mechanism through which the mPFC exerts executive control over the encoding of those events in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although we now have a fair understanding of memory encoding, the real-time processes through which the brain controls the strength of memory encoding remain mostly unknown. Developing an understanding of these memory regulation processes is important because it informs a new strategy for memory enhancement, which is critically needed for the fast-growing elderly population facing memory handicaps. We discovered that activating one region of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) facilitated rats to form memories of important events without increasing the learning of unimportant details. The memory enhancement was associated with improved responses of mPFC network to the important events. Manipulations of the mPFC, therefore, allow for tapping into intrinsic memory encoding processes to enhance event memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Local translation in neurites is a phenomenon that enhances spatial segregation of proteins and their functions away from the cell body, yet it is unclear how local translation varies across neuronal cell types. Further, it is unclear if differences in local translation across cell types simply reflect differences in transcription or if there is also a cell type specific posttranscriptional regulation of the location and translation of specific mRNAs. Most of the mRNAs discovered as locally translated have been identified from hippocampal neurons because their laminar organization facilitates neurite specific dissection and microscopy methods. Given the diversity of neurons across the brain, studies have not yet analyzed how locally translated mRNAs differ across cell types. Here, we used the SynapTRAP method to harvest two broad cell types in the mouse forebrain: GABAergic neurons and layer 5 projection neurons. While some transcripts overlap, the majority of the local translatome is not shared across these cell types. In addition to differences driven by baseline expression levels, some transcripts also exhibit cell type specific post transcriptional regulation. Finally, we provide evidence that GABAergic neurons specifically localize mRNAs for peptide neurotransmitters, including somatostatin and cortistatin, suggesting localized production of these key signaling molecules in the neurites of GABAergic neurons. Overall, this work suggests that differences in local translation in neurites across neuronal cell types are poised to contribute substantially to the heterogeneity in neuronal phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; All RNAs are generated in the nucleus, but in neurons some of these RNAs are shuttled for local protein production in neurites towards synapses. There are many types of neurons which express different complements of receptors and perform different functions. However, there has not yet been a direct comparison of the ribosome-bound transcripts in neurites across cells. Here, we identify and define differences in ribosome-bound RNAs isolated from neurites of two contrasting types of neurons. Some of these differences are due to the neurons not creating the RNA at baseline and some are differences in RNA localization or ribosome binding in neurites. We also identified RNAs for key neurotransmitter proteins that had not been previously described as produced in neurites, suggesting these may be locally produced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Longitudinal changes in semantic concreteness in semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA)</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of grey matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (Time 1 and Time 2) in patients with svPPA (n=11) and bvFTD (n=15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (n=7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Semantic memory is the generalizable knowledge of the world around us, including objects, concepts, and words. It is profoundly impaired in a rare form of frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). The specific impairment of concrete concept knowledge in svPPA, compared to abstract concept knowledge, provides important neurolinguistic understanding of how we process word meaning. Yet, almost no studies to date have related longitudinal cognitive changes to progressive neurodegeneration in svPPA. This study is the first to relate progressive atrophy in svPPA to longitudinal semantic changes; we find that progressive grey matter atrophy in right ventral temporal regions is associated with declining production of concrete nouns in svPPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on &quot;fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia&quot;, &quot;fear avoidance beliefs&quot; or &quot;pain anxiety&quot;, pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with non-specific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied Multiple Kernel Learning approach allowed generating models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of non-overlapping neural predictors within fear processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Pain-related fear, often assessed through self-reports such as questionnaires, has shown prognostic value and clinical utility for a variety of musculoskeletal pain disorders. However, it remains difficult to determine a common underlying construct of pain-related fear due to several proposed constructs among questionnaires. The current study describes a novel neuroscientific approach using machine learning of neural patterns within the fear circuit of chronic low back pain patients that has the potential to identify neural commonalities or differences among the various constructs. Ultimately, this approach might afford a deeper understanding of the suggested constructs and might be also applied to other domains where ambiguity exists between different psychological constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;BDNF is a critical contributor to neuronal growth, development, learning, and memory. Although extensively studied in the brain, BDNF is also expressed by primary afferent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Unfortunately, anatomical and functional studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF have been limited by the availability of appropriate molecular tools. Here, we used targeted, inducible molecular approaches to characterize the expression pattern of primary afferent BDNF and the extent to which it contributes to a variety of pain and itch behaviors. Using a &lt;i&gt;BDNF-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; reporter mouse, we found that BDNF is expressed primarily by myelinated primary afferents and has limited overlap with the major peptidergic and non-peptidergic subclasses of nociceptors and pruritoceptors. We also observed extensive neuronal, but not glial, expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In addition, because BDNF null mice are not viable and even Cre-mediated deletion of BDNF from sensory neurons could have developmental consequences, here we deleted BDNF selectively from sensory neurons, in the adult, using an advillin-Cre-ER line crossed to floxed BDNF mice. We found that BDNF deletion in the adult altered few itch or acute and chronic pain behaviors, beyond sexually dimorphic phenotypes in the tail immersion, histamine, and formalin tests. Based on the anatomical distribution of sensory neuron-derived BDNF and its limited contribution to pain and itch processing, we suggest that future studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF should examine behaviors evoked by activation of myelinated primary afferents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain state–dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: (1) the associative group received 30 pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; and (2) in the control group, the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl–Meyer assessment [LE‐FM; primary outcome measure]) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials [MEPs]) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median [interquartile range] LE‐FM improvement = 6.5 [3.5–8.25] and 3 [0.75–3], respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation. Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–12&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a 6‐month clinical study with 3 transradial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–18&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Direct Evidence for Prediction Signals in Frontal Cortex Independent of Prediction Error</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction error (PE) signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from PE signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for PC in the form of PE signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here, we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex evinces prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The broadband high-frequency amplitude (HFA) was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single-trial HFA predicted deviations and correlated with poststimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of PE signals.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Acquisition of Spatial Search Strategies and Reversal Learning in the Morris Water Maze Depend on Disparate Brain Functional Connectivity in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Learning has been proposed to coincide with changes in connections between brain regions. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) to map brain-wide functional connectivity (FC) in mice that were trained in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze. C57BL6 mice were investigated in a small animal MRI scanner following 2, 10, or 15 days of acquisition learning, or 5 days of reversal learning. Spatial learning coincided with progressive and changing FC between telencephalic regions that have been implemented in spatial learning (such as hippocampus, cingulate, visual, and motor cortex). Search strategy assessment demonstrated that the use of cognitively advanced spatial strategies correlated positively with extensive telencephalic connectivity, whereas non-spatial strategies correlated negatively with connectivity. FC patterns were different and more extensive after reversal learning compared with after extended acquisition learning, which could explain why reversal learning has been shown to be more sensitive to subtle functional defects.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ceftriaxone Treatment Preserves Cortical Inhibitory Interneuron Function via Transient Salvage of GLT-1 in a Rat Traumatic Brain Injury Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy328</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy328/5257442?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a decrease in glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) expression, the major mechanism for glutamate removal from synapses. Coupled with an increase in glutamate release from dead and dying neurons, this causes an increase in extracellular glutamate. The ensuing glutamate excitotoxicity disproportionately damages vulnerable GABAergic parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons, resulting in a progressively worsening cortical excitatory:inhibitory imbalance due to a loss of GABAergic inhibitory tone, as evidenced by chronic post-traumatic symptoms such as epilepsy, and supported by neuropathologic findings. This loss of intracortical inhibition can be measured and followed noninvasively using long-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with mechanomyography (LI-ppTMS-MMG). Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic, is a potent stimulator of the expression of rodent GLT-1 and would presumably decrease excitotoxic damage to GABAergic interneurons. It may thus be a viable antiepileptogenic intervention. Using a rat fluid percussion injury TBI model, we utilized LI-ppTMS-MMG, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry to test whether ceftriaxone treatment preserves intracortical inhibition and cortical parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneuron function after TBI in rat motor cortex. We show that neocortical GLT-1 gene and protein expression are significantly reduced 1 week after TBI, and this transient loss is mitigated by ceftriaxone. Importantly, whereas intracortical inhibition declines progressively after TBI, 1 week of post-TBI ceftriaxone treatment attenuates the loss of inhibition compared to saline-treated controls. This finding is accompanied by significantly higher parvalbumin gene and protein expression in ceftriaxone-treated injured rats. Our results highlight prospects for ceftriaxone as an intervention after TBI to prevent cortical inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, partly by preserving GLT-1 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Representations of Perceived and Retrieved Visual Information in Hippocampus and Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy325</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy325/5257445?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory retrieval is thought to depend on interactions between hippocampus and cortex, but the nature of representation in these regions and their relationship remains unclear. Here, we performed an ultra-high field fMRI (7T) experiment, comprising perception, learning and retrieval sessions. We observed a fundamental difference between representations in hippocampus and high-level visual cortex during perception and retrieval. First, while object-selective posterior fusiform cortex showed consistent responses that allowed us to decode object identity across both perception and retrieval one day after learning, object decoding in hippocampus was much stronger during retrieval than perception. Second, in visual cortex but not hippocampus, there was consistency in response patterns between perception and retrieval, suggesting that substantial neural populations are shared for both perception and retrieval. Finally, the decoding in hippocampus during retrieval was not observed when retrieval was tested on the same day as learning suggesting that the retrieval process itself is not sufficient to elicit decodable object representations. Collectively, these findings suggest that while cortical representations are stable between perception and retrieval, hippocampal representations are much stronger during retrieval, implying some form of reorganization of the representations between perception and retrieval.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Aging-Related Changes in Cognition and Cortical Integrity are Associated With Serum Expression of Candidate MicroRNAs for Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy323</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy323/5257443?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in molecular pathways responsible for aging and prevalent aging-related chronic diseases. However, the lack of research linking circulating levels of miRNAs to changes in the aging brain hampers clinical translation. Here, we have investigated if serum expression of brain-enriched miRNAs that have been proposed as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a) are also associated with cognitive functioning and changes of the cerebral cortex in normal elderly subjects. Results revealed that candidate miRNAs were linked to changes in cortical thickness (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, and miR-125b), cortical glucose metabolism (miR-29b, miR-125b, and miR-146a), and cognitive performance (miR-9, miR-34a, and miR-125b). While both miR-29b and miR-125b were related to aging-related structural and metabolic cortical changes, only expression levels of miR-125b were associated with patterns of glucose consumption shown by cortical regions that correlated with executive function. Together, these findings suggest that serum expression of AD-related miRNAs are biologically meaningful in aging and may play a role as biomarkers of cerebral vulnerability in late life.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: EphA4 Regulates Hippocampal Neural Precursor Proliferation in the Adult Mouse Brain by d-Serine Modulation of N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy319</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy319/5257446?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a major region of the adult rodent brain in which neurogenesis occurs throughout life. The EphA4 receptor, which regulates neurogenesis and boundary formation in the developing brain, is also expressed in the adult DG, but whether it regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not known. Here, we show that, in the adult mouse brain, EphA4 inhibits hippocampal precursor cell proliferation but does not affect precursor differentiation or survival. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 significantly increased hippocampal precursor proliferation &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt;, by blocking EphA4 forward signaling. EphA4 was expressed by mature hippocampal DG neurons but not neural precursor cells, and an EphA4 antagonist, EphA4-Fc, did not activate clonal cultures of precursors until they were co-cultured with non-precursor cells, indicating an indirect effect of EphA4 on the regulation of precursor activity. Supplementation with &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine blocked the increased precursor proliferation induced by EphA4 inhibition, whereas blocking the interaction between &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) promoted precursor activity, even at the clonal level. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EphA4 indirectly regulates adult hippocampal precursor proliferation and thus plays a role in neurogenesis via &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine-regulated NMDAR signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Temporal Metacognition as the Decoding of Self-Generated Brain Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy318</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy318/5257447?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metacognition, the ability to know about one’s thought process, is self-referential. Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations (β; 15–40 Hz) with increases in early β power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of β power in a low-dimensional space (β state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that β states instantiate an internal variable determining the fate of the timing network’s trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing, suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reorganization of Higher-Order Somatosensory Cortex After Sensory Loss from Hand in Squirrel Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy317</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy317/5257449?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Unilateral dorsal column lesions (DCL) at the cervical spinal cord deprive the hand regions of somatosensory cortex of tactile activation. However, considerable cortical reactivation occurs over weeks to months of recovery. While most studies focused on the reactivation of primary somatosensory area 3b, here, for the first time, we address how the higher-order somatosensory cortex reactivates in the same monkeys after DCL that vary across cases in completeness, post-lesion recovery times, and types of treatments. We recorded neural responses to tactile stimulation in areas 3a, 3b, 1, secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and occasionally areas 2/5. Our analysis emphasized comparisons of the responsiveness, somatotopy, and receptive field size between areas 3b, 1, and S2/PV across DCL conditions and recovery times. The results indicate that the extents of the reactivation in higher-order somatosensory areas 1 and S2/PV closely reflect the reactivation in primary somatosensory cortex. Responses in higher-order areas S2 and PV can be stronger than those in area 3b, thus suggesting converging or alternative sources of inputs. The results also provide evidence that both primary and higher-order fields are effectively activated after long recovery times as well as after behavioral and electrocutaneous stimulation interventions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: erbb4 Deficits in Chandelier Cells of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Confer Cognitive Dysfunctions: Implications for Schizophrenia</title>

Chandelier cells (ChCs, also known as axo-axonic cells) are a distinct GABAergic interneuron subtype that exclusively target the axonal initial segment, which is the site of pyramidal neuron action potential initiation. ChCs are a source of ErbB4 expression and alterations in ChC-pyramidal neuron connectivity occur in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of schizophrenic patients and animal models of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of ErbB4 in mPFC ChCs to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remains unknown. By conditional deletion or knockdown of ErbB4 from mPFC ChCs, we demonstrated that ErbB4 deficits led to impaired ChC-pyramidal neuron connections and cognitive dysfunctions. Furthermore, the cognitive dysfunctions were normalized by L-838417, an agonist of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;α2 receptors enriched in the axonal initial segment. Given that cognitive dysfunctions are a core symptom of schizophrenia, our results may provide a new perspective for understanding the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;α2 receptors may be potential pharmacological targets for its treatment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Wdr1 Deficit Impairs Learning and Memory by Perturbing F-actin Depolymerization in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy301</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;WD repeat protein 1 (Wdr1), known as a cofactor of actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, is conserved among eukaryotes, and it plays a critical role in the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the function of Wdr1 in the central nervous system remains elusive. Using &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; conditional knockout mice, we demonstrated that Wdr1 plays a significant role in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory. The knockout mice exhibited altered reversal spatial learning and fear responses. Moreover, the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; CKO mice showed significant abnormalities in spine morphology and synaptic function, including enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation and impaired long-term depression. Furthermore, we observed that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wdr1&lt;/span&gt; deficiency perturbed actin rearrangement through regulation of the ADF/cofilin activity. Taken together, these results indicate that Wdr1 in the hippocampal CA1 area plays a critical role in actin dynamics in associative learning and postsynaptic receptor availability.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Circuit Models of Low-Dimensional Shared Variability in Cortical Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31043-2?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31043-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Population-wide fluctuations of neural population activity are widely observed in cortical recordings. Huang et al. show that turbulent dynamics in spatially ordered recurrent networks give rise to low-dimensional shared variability, which can be suppressed by depolarizing inhibitory neurons.</description>

	<title>Neuron: The Hippocampus and Neocortical Inhibitory Engrams Protect against Memory Interference</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31051-1?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31051-1?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Koolschijn et al. reveal two distinct mechanisms that protect overlapping memories from interference in the human brain. One involves separating memories in the hippocampus. The other involves neocortical inhibition, which protects against memory interference unless GABA is reduced using brain stimulation.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Positive Allosteric Modulation of AMPAR by PF-4778574 Produced Rapid Onset Antidepressant Actions in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy324</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy324/5253205?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It has been reported that fast-acting antidepressants enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the fast-acting antidepressants lead to an activation of AMPAR pathways remain largely unclear. To address this issue, a novel AMPAR positive allosteric agonist, PF-4778574, was used to test the rapid effects and the role of VGF (nonacronymic)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/AKT signaling in these actions in mice. We found that PF-4778574 rapidly alleviated chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, knock down of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in the PFC of mice induced depression-like behaviors, whereas treatment with PF-4778574 was sufficient to alleviate it, indicating a presynaptic VGLUT1 independent effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibitors of AMPAR or of L-type voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (L-VDCC) blocked the antidepressants’ effect on behaviors and the upregulation on the AMPAR-mediated VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling of PF-4778574. Together, our findings indicate that postsynaptic AMPAR activation followed by activation of L-VDCC and subsequent VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling are required for the rapid antidepressant effects of PF-4778574. Our data support a promising therapeutic profile for PF-4778574 as a new fast-acting antidepressant.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Superficial White Matter in Autism and Its Role in Connectivity Anomalies and Symptom Severity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy321</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the majority of neuroimaging studies have focused on the analysis of cortical morphology. White matter changes remain less understood, particularly their association to cortical structure and function. Here, we focused on region that has gained only little attention in ASD neuroimaging: the superficial white matter (SWM) immediately beneath the cortical interface, a compartment playing a prominent role in corticogenesis that incorporates long- and short-range fibers implicated in corticocortical connectivity. Studying a multicentric dataset of ASD and neurotypical controls, we harnessed surface-based techniques to aggregate microstructural SWM diffusion features. Multivariate analysis revealed SWM anomalies in ASD compared with controls in medial parietal and temporoparietal regions. Effects were similar in children and adolescents/adults and consistent across sites. Although SWM anomalies were more confined when correcting for cortical thickness and surface area, findings were overall robust. Diffusion anomalies modulated functional connectivity reductions in ASD and related to symptom severity. Furthermore, mediation models indicated a link between SWM changes, functional connectivity, and symptom load. Analyses targeting the SWM offer a novel perspective on the interplay between structural and functional network perturbations in ASD, highlighting a potentially important neurobiological substrate contributing to its diverse behavioral phenotype.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31077-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Gentle touch sensation in mammals depends on synaptic transmission from primary sensory cells (Merkel cells) to secondary sensory neurons. Hoffman et al. (2018) identify norepinephrine and β2-adrendergic receptors as the neurotransmitter-receptor pair responsible for sustained touch responses. The findings may deepen understanding of how drugs affect touch and pain sensation.</description>

	<description>Nociceptin opioid peptide receptor agonists interact with mu-opioid receptor agonists for pain relief. A new study by Ding et al. (2018) examines a bifunctional nociceptin- and mu-opioid receptor agonist, AT-121, that provides analgesia without physiological side effects or abuse liability, offering a promising new hope toward better analgesics.</description>

	<description>The nervous system relies on a combinatorial code of protein interactions that determine wiring specificity. Two complementary studies by Cosmanescu et al. (2018) and Xu et al. (2018) present the most comprehensive biophysical and structural analysis of the cell-recognition proteins DIP and Dpr to date, and the discovery of key functions of DIP-α and Dpr6/10 in the wiring of the Drosophila visual system.</description>

Laferrière et al. now establish that TDP-43 assemblies from distinct FTD subtypes have different structures, neurotoxicities, and seeding activities, which correlate with FTD severity. Thus, distinct pathological TDP-43 assemblies akin to prion strains might underpin distinct FTD subtypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/iG3FwIxyfag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Role of De Novo Noncoding Regulatory Mutations in Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>

	<description>Advances in sequencing technology have significantly expanded our understanding of the genetics of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Continued technological improvements and cost reductions have now shifted the focus to investigations into the functional noncoding portions of the genome. There is a patient trend toward an excess of de novo and potentially disruptive mutations among conserved noncoding sequences implicated in the regulation of genes. The signals become stronger when restricted to genes already implicated in NDDs, but de novo mutation in such elements is estimated to account for &amp;lt;5% of patients.</description>
