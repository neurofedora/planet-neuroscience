	<title>Journal of Neurology: Event-related potentials using the auditory novel paradigm in patients with myotonic dystrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10465-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Clinical course of central nervous system demyelinating neurological adverse events associated with anti-TNF therapy</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleomorphic cytokine that can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a wide spectrum of inflammatory pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our aim was to characterize the diagnostic significance of CSF IL-6 among various CNS inflammatory diseases with pseudotumoral lesions (CNSID) and primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively analyzed the CSF IL-6 concentrations in 43 consecutive patients with suspected PCNSL. A total of 28 patients were positively diagnosed with PCNSL and 15 with CNSID. We verified the results with CSF IL-10, an established biomarker for PCNSL.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the PCNSL group, the median CSF IL-6 concentration was 8 pg/ml, interquartile range (IQR) 5–18.5. For the patients with CNSID, the median concentration was 70 pg/ml, IQR 5–1368. A group comparison showed significantly higher CSF IL-6 levels in patients with CNSID than in those with PCNSL (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.032). Moreover, IL-6 was correlated with CSF cell count in the CNSID group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.56, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028), but not in the PCNSL group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.13).&lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We found significantly higher CSF IL-10 levels in patients with PCNSL than in patients with CNS inflammatory lesions (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion and conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our study suggests that CSF IL-6 levels could represent, in addition to CSF IL-10, a useful biomarker in the differential diagnosis of CNSID and suspected PCNSL.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Multifocal neutrophilic meningoencephalitis: a novel disorder responsive to anakinra</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10321-8</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10321-8</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds for patients with severe COVID-19: etiologic hypotheses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10313-8</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10313-8</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0002), higher FiO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04]).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;</description>

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To perform an updated review of the literature on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19-infected patients&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A PRISMA-guideline-based systematic review was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Series reporting neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients were studied.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;39 studies and 68,361 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Up to 21.3% of COVID-19 patients presented neurological symptoms. Headache (5.4%), skeletal muscle injury (5.1%), psychiatric disorders (4.6%), impaired consciousness (2.8%), gustatory/olfactory dysfunction (2.3%), acute cerebrovascular events (1.4%), and dizziness (1.3%), were the most frequently reported neurological manifestations. Ischemic stroke occurred among 1.3% of COVID-19 patients. Other less common neurological manifestations were cranial nerve impairment (0.6%), nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%), epilepsy (0.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.15%). Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were reported in 14% and 4% of patients with a severe disease, respectively, and they were significantly higher compared to non-severe patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Individual patient data from 129 COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were extracted: mean age was 64.4 (SD ± 6.2), 78.5% had anterior circulation occlusions, the mean NIHSS was 15 (SD ± 7), and the intra-hospital mortality rate was 22.8%. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required among 63% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This updated review of literature, shows that headache, skeletal muscle injury, psychiatric disorders, impaired consciousness, and gustatory/olfactory dysfunction were the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were significantly higher among patients with a severe infection. AIS patients required ICU admission in 63% of cases, while intra-hospital mortality rate was close to 23%.&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To report on efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in a case series of patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our preliminary findings suggest that IVIg may represent a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-associated encephalopathy. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08908</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a powerful swarm intelligence meta-heuristic optimization
algorithm called Dynamic Cat Swarm Optimization. The formulation is through
modifying the existing Cat Swarm Optimization. The original Cat Swarm
Optimization suffers from the shortcoming of 'premature convergence', which is
the possibility of entrapment in local optima which usually happens due to the
off-balance between exploration and exploitation phases. Therefore, the
proposed algorithm suggests a new method to provide a proper balance between
these phases by modifying the selection scheme and the seeking mode of the
algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 23 classical
test functions, 10 modern test functions (CEC 2019) and a real world scenario
are used. In addition, the Dimension-wise diversity metric is used to measure
the percentage of the exploration and exploitation phases. The optimization
results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which ranks first
compared to several well-known algorithms available in the literature.
Furthermore, statistical methods and graphs are also used to further confirm
the outperformance of the algorithm. Finally, the conclusion as well as future
directions to further improve the algorithm are discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wave-based analog signal processing holds the promise of extremely fast,
on-the-fly, power-efficient data processing, occurring as a wave propagates
through an artificially engineered medium. Yet, due to the fundamentally weak
non-linearities of traditional wave materials, such analog processors have been
so far largely confined to simple linear projections such as image edge
detection or matrix multiplications. Complex neuromorphic computing tasks,
which inherently require strong non-linearities, have so far remained
out-of-reach of wave-based solutions, with a few attempts that implemented
non-linearities on the digital front, or used weak and inflexible non-linear
sensors, restraining the learning performance. Here, we tackle this issue by
demonstrating the relevance of Time-Floquet physics to induce a strong
non-linear entanglement between signal inputs at different frequencies,
enabling a power-efficient and versatile wave platform for analog extreme deep
learning involving a single, uniformly modulated dielectric layer and a
scattering medium. We prove the efficiency of the method for extreme learning
machines and reservoir computing to solve a range of challenging learning
tasks, from forecasting chaotic time series to the simultaneous classification
of distinct datasets. Our results open the way for wave-based machine learning
with high energy efficiency, speed, and scalability.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Synaptic balancing: a biologically plausible local learning rule that provably increases neural network noise robustness without sacrificing task performance. (arXiv:2107.08530v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08530</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel, biologically plausible local learning rule that
provably increases the robustness of neural dynamics to noise in nonlinear
recurrent neural networks with homogeneous nonlinearities. Our learning rule
achieves higher noise robustness without sacrificing performance on the task
and without requiring any knowledge of the particular task. The plasticity
dynamics -- an integrable dynamical system operating on the weights of the
network -- maintains a multiplicity of conserved quantities, most notably the
network's entire temporal map of input to output trajectories. The outcome of
our learning rule is a synaptic balancing between the incoming and outgoing
synapses of every neuron. This synaptic balancing rule is consistent with many
known aspects of experimentally observed heterosynaptic plasticity, and
moreover makes new experimentally testable predictions relating plasticity at
the incoming and outgoing synapses of individual neurons. Overall, this work
provides a novel, practical local learning rule that exactly preserves overall
network function and, in doing so, provides new conceptual bridges between the
disparate worlds of the neurobiology of heterosynaptic plasticity, the
engineering of regularized noise-robust networks, and the mathematics of
integrable Lax dynamical systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Brain-Computer Interface system is a profoundly developing area of
experimentation for Motor activities which plays vital role in decoding
cognitive activities. Classification of Cognitive-Motor Imagery activities from
EEG signals is a critical task. Hence proposed a unique algorithm for
classifying left/right-hand movements by utilizing Multi-layer Perceptron
Neural Network. Handcrafted statistical Time domain and Power spectral density
frequency domain features were extracted and obtained a combined accuracy of
96.02%. Results were compared with the deep learning framework. In addition to
accuracy, Precision, F1-Score, and recall was considered as the performance
metrics. The intervention of unwanted signals contaminates the EEG signals
which influence the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, a novel approach
was approached to remove the artifacts using Independent Components Analysis
which boosted the performance. Following the selection of appropriate feature
vectors that provided acceptable accuracy. The same method was used on all nine
subjects. As a result, intra-subject accuracy was obtained for 9 subjects
94.72%. The results show that the proposed approach would be useful to classify
the upper limb movements accurately.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm for neural
architecture search, applicable to global search spaces. The algorithm's
architectural representation organizes the topology in multiple hierarchical
modules, while the design process exploits this representation, in order to
explore the search space. We also employ a curation system, which promotes the
utilization of well performing sub-structures to subsequent generations. We
apply our method to Fashion-MNIST and NAS-Bench101, achieving accuracies of
$93.2\%$ and $94.8\%$ respectively in a relatively small number of generations.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08467</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08467</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new stochastic verification algorithm that formally quantifies
the behavioral robustness of any time-continuous process formulated as a
continuous-depth model. The algorithm solves a set of global optimization (Go)
problems over a given time horizon to construct a tight enclosure (Tube) of the
set of all process executions starting from a ball of initial states. We call
our algorithm GoTube. Through its construction, GoTube ensures that the
bounding tube is conservative up to a desired probability. GoTube is
implemented in JAX and optimized to scale to complex continuous-depth models.
Compared to advanced reachability analysis tools for time-continuous neural
networks, GoTube provably does not accumulate over-approximation errors between
time steps and avoids the infamous wrapping effect inherent in symbolic
techniques. We show that GoTube substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
verification tools in terms of the size of the initial ball, speed,
time-horizon, task completion, and scalability, on a large set of experiments.
GoTube is stable and sets the state-of-the-art for its ability to scale up to
time horizons well beyond what has been possible before.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Test Case Selection (TCS) aims to select a subset of the test suite to run
for regression testing. The selection is typically based on past coverage and
execution cost data. Researchers have successfully used multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), such as NSGA-II and its variants, to solve
this problem. These MOEAs use traditional crossover operators to create new
candidate solutions through genetic recombination. Recent studies in numerical
optimization have shown that better recombinations can be made using machine
learning, in particular link-age learning. Inspired by these recent advances in
this field, we propose a new variant of NSGA-II, called L2-NSGA, that uses
linkage learning to optimize test case selection. In particular, we use an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to infer promising patterns among the
solutions (subset of test suites). Then, these patterns are used in the next
iterations of L2-NSGA to create solutions that preserve these inferred
patterns. Our results show that our customizations make NSGA-II more effective
for test case selection. The test suite sub-sets generated by L2-NSGA are less
expensive and detect more faults than those generated by MOEAs used in the
literature for regression testing.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series is an essential
tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. There exist different
entropy measures in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity
of time series. However, these measures have some drawbacks especially in short
time series. To overcome the difficulties, this paper proposes a new method for
estimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet 784:25:10 neural
network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix consists of 19625 elements which is
filled with the time series elements. After that, the network is trained on
MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The accuracy is
considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. A more complex
transformation of the input information by the time series in the reservoir
leads to higher NNetEn values. Many practical time series data have less than
19625 elements. Some duplicating or stretching methods are investigated to
overcome this difficulty and the most successful method is identified for
practical applications. The epochs number in the training process of LogNNet is
considered as the input parameter. A new time series characteristic called time
series learning inertia is introduced to investigate the effect of epochs
number in the efficiency of neural network. To show the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method, it is applied on some chaotic, periodic,
random, binary and constant time series. The NNetEn is compared with some
existing entropy measures. The results show that the proposed method is more
robust and accurate than existing methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This works proposes a methodology to searching for automatically Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN) by using Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA). The goal of
this methodology is to find compact networks whit good performance for
classification problems. The main reason for developing this work is centered
at the difficulties of configuring compact ANNs with good performance rating.
The use of CGAs aims at seeking the components of the RNA in the same way that
a common Genetic Algorithm (GA), but it has the differential of incorporating a
Cellular Automaton (CA) to give location for the GA individuals. The location
imposed by the CA aims to control the spread of solutions in the populations to
maintain the genetic diversity for longer time. This genetic diversity is
important for obtain good results with the GAs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor control is a fundamental process that underlies all voluntary
behavioral responses. Several different theories based on different principles
(task dynamics, equilibrium-point theory, passive-motion paradigm, active
inference, optimal control) account for specific aspects of how actions are
produced, but fail to provide a unified view on this problem. Here we propose a
concise theory of motor control based on three principles: optimal feedback
control, control with a receding time horizon, and task representation by a
series of via-points updated at fixed frequency. By construction, the theory
provides a suitable solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem, i.e. trajectory
formation in the presence of redundancies and noise. We show through computer
simulations that the theory also explains the production of discrete,
continuous, rhythmic and temporally-constrained movements, and their parametric
and statistical properties (scaling laws, power laws, speed/accuracy
tradeoffs). The theory has no free parameters and only limited variations in
its implementation details and in the nature of noise are necessary to
guarantee its explanatory power.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biological agents have meaningful interactions with their environment despite
the absence of immediate reward signals. In such instances, the agent can learn
preferred modes of behaviour that lead to predictable states -- necessary for
survival. In this paper, we pursue the notion that this learnt behaviour can be
a consequence of reward-free preference learning that ensures an appropriate
trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. For this, we
introduce a model-based Bayesian agent equipped with a preference learning
mechanism (pepper) using conjugate priors. These conjugate priors are used to
augment the expected free energy planner for learning preferences over states
(or outcomes) across time. Importantly, our approach enables the agent to learn
preferences that encourage adaptive behaviour at test time. We illustrate this
in the OpenAI Gym FrozenLake and the 3D mini-world environments -- with and
without volatility. Given a constant environment, these agents learn confident
(i.e., precise) preferences and act to satisfy them. Conversely, in a volatile
setting, perpetual preference uncertainty maintains exploratory behaviour. Our
experiments suggest that learnable (reward-free) preferences entail a trade-off
between exploration and preference satisfaction. Pepper offers a
straightforward framework suitable for designing adaptive agents when reward
functions cannot be predefined as in real environments.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Improving Entropic Out-of-Distribution Detection using Isometric Distances and the Minimum Distance Score. (arXiv:2105.14399v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current out-of-distribution detection approaches usually present special
requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model's architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless. Code available at

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Simple and Cheap Setup for Timing Tapping Responses Synchronized to Auditory Stimuli. (arXiv:2105.01570v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring human capabilities to synchronize in time, adapt to perturbations
to timing sequences or reproduce time intervals often require experimental
setups that allow recording response times with millisecond precision. Most
setups present auditory stimuli using either MIDI devices or specialized
hardware such as Arduino and are often expensive or require calibration and
advanced programming skills. Here, we present in detail an experimental setup
that only requires an external sound card and minor electronic skills, works on
a conventional PC, is cheaper than alternatives and requires almost no
programming skills. It is intended for presenting any auditory stimuli and
recording tapping response times with within 2 milliseconds precision (up to
-2ms lag). This paper shows why desired accuracy in recording response times
against auditory stimuli is difficult to achieve in conventional computer
setups, presents an experimental setup to overcome this and explains in detail
how to set it up and use the provided code. Finally, the code for analyzing the
recorded tapping responses was evaluated, showing that no spurious or missing
events were found in 94% of the analyzed recordings.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00434</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several recent works have shown separation results between deep neural
networks, and hypothesis classes with inferior approximation capacity such as
shallow networks or kernel classes. On the other hand, the fact that deep
networks can efficiently express a target function does not mean that this
target function can be learned efficiently by deep neural networks. In this
work we study the intricate connection between learnability and approximation
capacity. We show that learnability with deep networks of a target function
depends on the ability of simpler classes to approximate the target.
Specifically, we show that a necessary condition for a function to be learnable
by gradient descent on deep neural networks is to be able to approximate the
function, at least in a weak sense, with shallow neural networks. We also show
that a class of functions can be learned by an efficient statistical query
algorithm if and only if it can be approximated in a weak sense by some kernel
class. We give several examples of functions which demonstrate depth
separation, and conclude that they cannot be efficiently learned, even by a
hypothesis class that can efficiently approximate them.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Sensitivity -- Local Index to Control Chaoticity or Gradient Globally. (arXiv:2012.13134v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13134</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13134</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, we introduce a fully local index named &quot;sensitivity&quot; for each neuron to
control chaoticity or gradient globally in a neural network (NN). We also
propose a learning method to adjust it named &quot;sensitivity adjustment learning
(SAL)&quot;. The index is the gradient magnitude of its output with respect to its
inputs. By adjusting its time average to 1.0 in each neuron, information
transmission in the neuron changes to be moderate without shrinking or
expanding for both forward and backward computations. That results in moderate
information transmission through a layer of neurons when the weights and inputs
are random. Therefore, SAL can control the chaoticity of the network dynamics
in a recurrent NN (RNN). It can also solve the vanishing gradient problem in
error backpropagation (BP) learning in a deep feedforward NN or an RNN. We
demonstrate that when applying SAL to an RNN with small and random initial
weights, log-sensitivity, which is the logarithm of RMS (root mean square)
sensitivity over all the neurons, is equivalent to the maximum Lyapunov
exponent until it reaches 0.0. We also show that SAL works with BP or BPTT (BP
through time) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in a 300-layer NN or an
RNN that learns a problem with a lag of 300 steps between the first input and
the output. Compared with manually fine-tuning the spectral radius of the
weight matrix before learning, SAL's continuous nonlinear learning nature
prevents loss of sensitivities during learning, resulting in a significant
improvement in learning performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many networks in the brain are sparsely connected, and the brain eliminates
synapses during development and learning. How could the brain decide which
synapses to prune? In a recurrent network, determining the importance of a
synapse between two neurons is a difficult computational problem, depending on
the role that both neurons play and on all possible pathways of information
flow between them. Noise is ubiquitous in neural systems, and often considered
an irritant to be overcome. Here we suggest that noise could play a functional
role in synaptic pruning, allowing the brain to probe network structure and
determine which synapses are redundant. We construct a simple, local,
unsupervised plasticity rule that either strengthens or prunes synapses using
only synaptic weight and the noise-driven covariance of the neighboring
neurons. For a subset of linear and rectified-linear networks, we prove that
this rule preserves the spectrum of the original matrix and hence preserves
network dynamics even when the fraction of pruned synapses asymptotically
approaches 1. The plasticity rule is biologically-plausible and may suggest a
new role for noise in neural computation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Differentiable neural computers extend artificial neural networks with an
explicit memory without interference, thus enabling the model to perform
classic computation tasks such as graph traversal. However, such models are
difficult to train, requiring long training times and large datasets. In this
work, we achieve some of the computational capabilities of differentiable
neural computers with a model that can be trained very efficiently, namely an
echo state network with an explicit memory without interference. This extension
enables echo state networks to recognize all regular languages, including those
that contractive echo state networks provably can not recognize. Further, we
demonstrate experimentally that our model performs comparably to its
fully-trained deep version on several typical benchmark tasks for
differentiable neural computers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the brain communicate with spikes, which are discrete events in
time and value. Functional network models often employ rate units that are
continuously coupled by analog signals. Is there a qualitative difference
implied by these two forms of signaling? We develop a unified mean-field theory
for large random networks to show that first- and second-order statistics in
rate and binary networks are in fact identical if rate neurons receive the
right amount of noise. Their response to presented stimuli, however, can be
radically different. We quantify these differences by studying how nearby state
trajectories evolve over time, asking to what extent the dynamics is chaotic.
Chaos in the two models is found to be qualitatively different. In binary
networks we find a network-size-dependent transition to chaos and a chaotic
submanifold whose dimensionality expands stereotypically with time, while rate
networks with matched statistics are nonchaotic. Dimensionality expansion in
chaotic binary networks aids classification in reservoir computing and optimal
performance is reached within about a single activation per neuron; a fast
mechanism for computation that we demonstrate also in spiking networks. A
generalization of this mechanism extends to rate networks in their respective
chaotic regimes.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Increasing Serotonin to Reduce Parkinsonian Tremor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While current dopamine-based drugs seem to be effective for most Parkinson's disease (PD) motor dysfunctions, they produce variable responsiveness for resting tremor. This lack of consistency could be explained by considering recent evidence suggesting that PD resting tremor can be divided into different partially overlapping phenotypes based on the dopamine response. These phenotypes may be associated with different pathophysiological mechanisms produced by a cortical-subcortical network involving even non-dopaminergic areas traditionally not directly related to PD. In this study, we propose a bio-constrained computational model to study the neural mechanisms underlying a possible type of PD tremor: the one mainly involving the serotoninergic system. The simulations run with the model demonstrate that a physiological serotonin increase can partially recover dopamine levels at the early stages of the disease before the manifestation of overt tremor. This result suggests that monitoring serotonin concentration changes could be critical for early diagnosis. The simulations also show the effectiveness of a new pharmacological treatment for tremor that acts on serotonin to recover dopamine levels. This latter result has been validated by reproducing existing data collected with human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Long Non-coding RNA T-uc.189 Modulates Neural Progenitor Cell Fate by Regulating Srsf3 During Mouse Cerebral Cortex Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis is a complex process that depends on the delicate regulation of spatial and temporal gene expression. In our previous study, we found that transcribed ultra-conserved regions (T-UCRs), a class of long non-coding RNAs that contain UCRs, are expressed in the developing nervous systems of mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans. In this study, we first detected the full-length sequence of T-uc.189, revealing that it was mainly concentrated in the ventricular zone (VZ) and that its expression decreased as the brain matured. Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of T-uc.189 inhibited neurogenesis. In addition, we found that T-uc.189 positively regulated the expression of serine-arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). Taken together, our results are the first to demonstrate that T-uc.189 regulates the expression of Srsf3 to maintain normal neurogenesis during cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Parietal Lobe Reorganization and Widespread Functional Connectivity Integration in Upper-Limb Amputees: A rs-fMRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The right parietal lobe plays an important role in body image, and disorders of body image emerge after lesions in the parietal lobe or with parietal lobe epilepsy. Body image disorder also often accompanies upper-limb amputation, in which the patient misperceives that their missing limb is still part of their body. Cortical reorganization is known to occur after upper-limb amputation, but it is not clear how widespread and to what degree functional connectivity (FC) is reorganized post-amputation, nor whether such changes might be related to misperceptions of body image. Twenty-four subjects who had a traumatically upper-limb amputees (ULAs) and 24 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG_R) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL_R) were defined using BrainNet Viewer. We calculated the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in ROIs and correlated the ROI mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) and mean scores on the phantom limb sensation (PLS) scale and beck depression index (BDI). We also calculated ROIs and whole-brain FC. Compared to the HC group, we observed significantly increased activation (mALFF) in ROIs of the ULA group. Moreover, correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between ROI mALFF and scores on the PLS. There was a significant negative correlation between the SPG_R mALFF and BDI scores. Seed-based, whole-brain FC analysis revealed that FC in the ULA group significantly decreased in many brain regions across the entire brain. The right parietal lobe appears to be involved in some aspect of body awareness and depression in amputation patients. Upper-limb amputation results not only in reorganization in the local brain area formerly representing the missing limb, but also results in more widespread reorganization through FC changes in whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Altered Spontaneous Neural Activity and Functional Connectivity in Parkinson’s Disease With Subthalamic Microlesion</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Transient improvement in motor symptoms are immediately observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) after an electrode has been implanted into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for deep brain stimulation (DBS). This phenomenon is known as the microlesion effect (MLE). However, the underlying mechanisms of MLE is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We utilized resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to evaluate changes in spontaneous brain activity and networks in PD patients during the microlesion period after DBS.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Overall, 37 PD patients and 13 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for this study. Rs-MRI information was collected from PD patients three days before DBS and one day after DBS, whereas the HCs group was scanned once. We utilized the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method in order to analyze differences in spontaneous whole-brain activity among all subjects. Furthermore, functional connectivity (FC) was applied to investigate connections between other brain regions and brain areas with significantly different ALFF before and after surgery in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;Relative to the PD-Pre-DBS group, the PD-Post-DBS group had higher ALFF in the right putamen, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus and lower ALFF in right angular gyrus, right precuneus, right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), left insula, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), bilateral middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral). Functional connectivity analysis revealed that these brain regions with significantly different ALFF scores demonstrated abnormal FC, largely in the temporal, prefrontal cortices and default mode network (DMN).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The subthalamic microlesion caused by DBS in PD was found to not only improve the activity of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, but also reduce the activity of the DMN and executive control network (ECN) related brain regions. Results from this study provide new insights into the mechanism of MLE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dysfunctional Brain Dynamics of Parkinson's Disease and the Effect of Acute Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697909</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697909</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can effectively alleviate PD symptoms. Although previous studies have detected network features of PD and DBS, few studies have considered their dynamic characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: We tested two hypotheses. (1) Reduced brain dynamics, as evidenced by slowed microstate dynamic change, is a characteristic of PD and is related to the movement disorders of patients with PD. (2) Therapeutic acute DBS can partially reverse slow brain dynamics in PD to healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis based on high density (256-channel) EEG to detect the effects of PD and DBS on brain dynamic changes on a sub-second timescale. We compared 21 healthy controls (HCs) with 20 patients with PD who were in either DBS-OFF or DBS-ON states. Assessment of movement disorder using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III was correlated with microstate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HCs, patients with PD displayed a longer mean microstate duration with reduced occurrence per second, which were significantly associated with movement disorders. In patients with PD, some parameters of microstate analysis were restored toward healthy levels after DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Resting-state EEG microstate analysis is an important tool for investigating brain dynamic changes in PD and DBS. PD can slow down brain dynamic change, and therapeutic acute DBS can partially reverse this change toward a healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Squamous and Respiratory Metaplasia After Olfactory Mucosal Resection</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resection of the olfactory mucosa (OM) is sometimes unavoidable during surgery; however, it is not known whether the OM can completely recover thereafter. The aim of this study was to uncover whether the OM fully recovers after mucosal resection and describe the process of OM regeneration. 8-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 18) were subjected to OM resection at the nasal septum; six rats were euthanized for histological examination 0, 30, and 90 days after surgery. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) lineage cells [mature and immature ORNs and ORN progenitors, and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs)], as well as dividing and apoptotic cells. Squamous and respiratory metaplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were also assessed. On day 30 after resection, the mucosa had regenerated, and mainly contained thin nerve bundles, basal cells, and immature ORNs, with a few mature ORNs and OECs. On day 90, the repaired nasal mucosa had degenerated into stratified squamous or ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia, with reducing ORNs. The lamina propria contained numerous macrophages. Partial regeneration was observed within 1 month after OM resection, whereas subsequent degeneration into squamous and respiratory epithelia occurred within 3 months. Given the poor persistence of ORNs and OECs, OM resection is likely to result in olfactory impairment. Overall, surgeons should be cautious not to injure the OM during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Emotional Modulation of Frontal Alpha Asymmetry - a Novel Biomarker of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective findings of brain injury or dysfunction are typically lacking in mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) despite prolonged post-concussion symptoms in some patients. Thus, there is a need for objective biomarkers of MTBI that reflect altered brain physiology underlying subjective symptoms. We have previously reported increased attention to threat-related stimuli in subjects with MTBI, suggesting a physiological vulnerability to depression. Vulnerability to depression has been linked with relatively greater activity of the right than left frontal cortex reflected in inverse pattern in frontal alpha with greater power on the left than right. We investigated whether patients with previous MTBI show this pattern of frontal activity reflected in more negative frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) scores. Furthermore, in search for potential biomarkers of MTBI, we created a novel index, emotional modulation of FAA (eFAA) and investigated whether it correlates with subjective symptoms. EEG was recorded while subjects with previous MTBI and controls performed a computer-based reaction time task integrating different cognitive executive functions and containing either threat-related or emotionally neutral visual stimuli. Post-concussion symptoms and depression were assessed using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and Beck’s depression inventory (BDI). Task-induced FAA was assessed and eFAA calculated by subtracting FAA in the context of neutral stimuli from FAA in the context of emotional stimuli. The MTBI group showed FAA scores reflecting relatively greater right-sided frontal activity compared to healthy controls. eFAA differentiated the symptomatic MTBI from non-symptomatic MTBI group and from healthy controls. eFAA also correlated with RPQ and BDI scores. In conclusion, FAA pattern previously linked with vulnerability to depression, was observed in patients with previous MTBI. Furthermore, eFAA has potential as a biomarker of altered affective brain functions in MTBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum is a very heterogenous brain area, composed of different domains and compartments, albeit lacking visible anatomical demarcations. Two populations of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) build the so-called direct and indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, whose coordinated activity is essential to control locomotion. Dysfunction of striatal SPNs is part of many movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In this mini review article, I will highlight recent studies utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the transcriptional profiles of striatal neurons. These studies discover that SPNs carry a transcriptional signature, indicating both their anatomical location and compartmental identity. Furthermore, the transcriptional profiles reveal the existence of additional distinct neuronal populations and previously unknown SPN sub-populations. In a parallel development, studies in rodent models of PD and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) report that direct pathway SPNs do not react uniformly to L-DOPA therapy, and that only a subset of these neurons is underlying the development of abnormal movements. Together, these studies demonstrate a new level of cellular complexity for striatal (dys-) function and locomotor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Children With Dyscalculia Show Hippocampal Hyperactivity During Symbolic Number Perception</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dyscalculia is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of arithmetical skills in children with normal intelligence and age-appropriate education. Two hypotheses attempt to explain the main cause of dyscalculia. The first hypothesis suggests that a problem with the core mechanisms of perceiving (non-symbolic) quantities is the cause of dyscalculia (core deficit hypothesis), while the alternative hypothesis suggests that dyscalculics have problems only with the processing of numerical symbols (access deficit hypothesis). In the present study, the symbolic and non-symbolic numerosity processing of typically developing children and children with dyscalculia were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Control (n = 15, mean age: 11.26) and dyscalculia (n = 12, mean age: 11.25) groups were determined using a wide-scale screening process. Participants performed a quantity comparison paradigm in the fMRI with two number conditions (dot and symbol comparison) and two difficulty levels (0.5 and 0.7 ratio). The results showed that the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left fusiform gyrus (so-called “number form area”) were activated for number perception as well as bilateral occipital and supplementary motor areas. The task difficulty engaged bilateral insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, IPS, and DLPFC activation. The dyscalculia group showed more activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex, left medial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex than the control group. The dyscalculia group showed left hippocampus activation specifically for the symbolic condition. Increased left hippocampal and left-lateralized frontal network activation suggest increased executive and memory-based compensation mechanisms during symbolic processing for dyscalculics. Overall, our findings support the access deficit hypothesis as a neural basis for dyscalculia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Visuospatial Attention Allocation as an Indicator of Cognitive Deficit in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is defined by changes in brain function resulting from external forces acting on the brain and is typically characterized by a host of physiological and functional changes such as cognitive deficits including attention problems. In the present study, we focused on the effect of TBI on the ability to allocate attention in vision (i.e., the use of endogenous and exogenous visual cues) by systematically reviewing previous literature on the topic. We conducted quantitative synthesis of 16 selected studies of visual attention following TBI, calculating 80 effect size estimates. The combined effect size was large (g = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) with medium heterogeneity (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 68.39%). Subgroup analyses revealed an increase in deficit with moderate-to-severe and severe TBI as compared to mild TBI [F&lt;sub&gt;(2, 76)&lt;/sub&gt; = 24.14, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. Task type was another key source of variability and subgroup analyses indicated that higher order attention processes were severely affected by TBI [F&lt;sub&gt;(2, 77)&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.66, p = 0.0051). Meta-regression analyses revealed significant improvement in visual attention deficit with time [p(mild) = 0.031, p(moderate-to-severe) = 0.002, p(severe) &amp;lt; 0.0001]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that visual attention is affected by TBI and that regular assessment of visual attention, using a systematic attention allocation task, may provide a useful clinical measure of cognitive impairment and change after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neural regulation of glucose homeostasis in normal and challenged conditions involves the modulation of pancreatic islet-cell function. Compromising the pancreas innervation causes islet autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes and islet cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. However, despite the richly innervated nature of the pancreas, islet innervation remains ill-defined. Here, we review the neuroanatomical and humoral basis of the cross-talk between the endocrine pancreas and autonomic and sensory neurons. Identifying the neurocircuitry and neurochemistry of the neuro-insular network would provide clues to neuromodulation-based approaches for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Preserved Thermal Pain in 3xTg-AD Mice With Increased Sensory-Discriminative Pain Sensitivity in Females but Affective-Emotional Dimension in Males as Early Sex-Specific AD-Phenotype Biomarkers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increase of the aging population, where quite chronic comorbid conditions are associated with pain, draws growing interest across its investigation and the underlying nociceptive mechanisms. Burn injuries associated problems might be of relevance in the older adult’s daily life, but in people with dementia, exposure to high temperatures and heat sources poses a significantly increased risk of burns. In this brief report, the hind paws and tail pain withdrawal reflexes and the emotional responses to thermal nociception in 3xTg-AD mice were characterized for the first time in the plantar test and compared to their non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts. We studied a cohort of male and female 3xTg-AD mice at asymptomatic (2 months), early (6 months), middle (9 months), and advanced (12 and 15 months) stages of the disease and as compared to sex- and age-matched NTg control mice with normal aging. At 20 and 40W intensities, the sensorial-discriminative thresholds eliciting the withdrawal responses were preserved from asymptomatic to advanced stages of the disease compared to NTg counterparts. Moreover, 3xTg-AD females consistently showed a greater sensory-discriminative sensitivity already at premorbid ages, whereas increased emotionality was shown in males. False-negative results were found in “blind to sex and age” analysis, warning about the need to study sexes independently. The current results and previous report in cold thermal stimulation provide two paradigms unveiling sex-specific early AD-phenotype nociceptive biomarkers to study the mechanistic underpinnings of sex-, age- and AD-disease-dependent thermal pain sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The T cell receptor (TCR-CD3) initiates T cell activation by binding to peptides of Major Histocompatibility Complexes (pMHC). The TCR-CD3 topology is well understood but the arrangement and dynamics of its cytoplasmic tails remains unknown, limiting our grasp of the signalling mechanism. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and modelling to investigate the entire TCR-CD3 embedded in a model membrane. Our study demonstrates conformational changes in the extracellular and transmembrane domains, and the arrangement of the TCR-CD3 cytoplasmic tails. The cytoplasmic tails formed highly interlaced structures while some tyrosines within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) penetrated the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Interactions between the cytoplasmic tails and phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids in the inner membrane leaflet led to the formation of a distinct anionic lipid fingerprint around the TCR-CD3. These results increase our understanding of the TCR-CD3 dynamics and the importance of membrane lipids in regulating T cell activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2qYGaVMD8Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuansheng Liu, Jinyan Li&lt;/p&gt;

Graphs such as de Bruijn graphs and OLC (overlap-layout-consensus) graphs have been widely adopted for the de novo assembly of genomic short reads. This work studies another important problem in the field: how graphs can be used for high-performance compression of the large-scale sequencing data. We present a novel graph definition named Hamming-Shifting graph to address this problem. The definition originates from the technological characteristics of next-generation sequencing machines, aiming to link all pairs of distinct reads that have a small Hamming distance or a small shifting offset or both. We compute multiple lexicographically minimal &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers to index the reads for an efficient search of the weight-lightest edges, and we prove a very high probability of successfully detecting these edges. The resulted graph creates a full mutual reference of the reads to cascade a code-minimized transfer of every child-read for an optimal compression. We conducted compression experiments on the minimum spanning forest of this extremely sparse graph, and achieved a 10 − 30% more file size reduction compared to the best compression results using existing algorithms. As future work, the separation and connectivity degrees of these giant graphs can be used as economical measurements or protocols for quick quality assessment of wet-lab machines, for sufficiency control of genomic library preparation, and for accurate de novo genome assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g7qspdQGlRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The effect of natural selection on the propagation of protein expression noise to bacterial growth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurens H. J. Krah, Rutger Hermsen&lt;/p&gt;

In bacterial cells, protein expression is a highly stochastic process. Gene expression noise moreover propagates through the cell and adds to fluctuations in the cellular growth rate. A common intuition is that, due to their relatively high noise amplitudes, proteins with a low mean expression level are the most important drivers of fluctuations in physiological variables. In this work, we challenge this intuition by considering the effect of natural selection on noise propagation. Mathematically, the contribution of each protein species to the noise in the growth rate depends on two factors: the noise amplitude of the protein’s expression level, and the sensitivity of the growth rate to fluctuations in that protein’s concentration. We argue that natural selection, while shaping mean abundances to increase the mean growth rate, also affects cellular sensitivities. In the limit in which cells grow optimally fast, the growth rate becomes most sensitive to fluctuations in highly abundant proteins. This causes abundant proteins to overall contribute strongly to the noise in the growth rate, despite their low noise levels. We further explore this result in an experimental data set of protein abundances, and test key assumptions in an evolving, stochastic toy model of cellular growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v5_3LM0wo3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Complex dendritic trees are a distinctive feature of neurons. Alterations to dendritic morphology are associated with developmental, behavioral and neurodegenerative changes. The highly-arborized PVD neuron of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; serves as a model to study dendritic patterning; however, quantitative, objective and automated analyses of PVD morphology are missing. Here, we present a method for neuronal feature extraction, based on deep-learning and fitting algorithms. The extracted neuronal architecture is represented by a database of structural elements for abstracted analysis. We obtain excellent automatic tracing of PVD trees and uncover that dendritic junctions are unevenly distributed. Surprisingly, these junctions are three-way-symmetrical on average, while dendritic processes are arranged orthogonally. We quantify the effect of mutation in &lt;i&gt;git-1&lt;/i&gt;, a regulator of dendritic spine formation, on PVD morphology and discover a localized reduction in junctions. Our findings shed new light on PVD architecture, demonstrating the effectiveness of our objective analyses of dendritic morphology and suggest molecular control mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jnUiVyH0d0U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Oligomers of the amyloid &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-protein (A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through their toxicity towards neurons. Understanding the process of oligomerization may contribute to the development of therapeutic agents, but this has been difficult due to the complexity of oligomerization and the metastability of the oligomers thus formed. To understand the kinetics of oligomer formation, and how that relates to the progression of AD, we developed models of the oligomerization process. Here, we use experimental data from cell viability assays and proxies for rate constants involved in monomer-dimer-trimer kinetics to develop a simple mathematical model linking A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; assembly to oligomer-induced neuronal degeneration. This model recapitulates the rapid growth of disease incidence with age. It does so through incorporation of age-dependent changes in rates of A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; monomer production and elimination. The model also describes clinical progression in genetic forms of AD (e.g., Down’s syndrome), changes in hippocampal volume, AD risk after traumatic brain injury, and spatial spreading of the disease due to foci in which A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; production is elevated. Continued incorporation of clinical and basic science data into the current model will make it an increasingly relevant model system for doing theoretical calculations that are not feasible in biological systems. In addition, terms in the model that have particularly large effects are likely to be especially useful therapeutic targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDgzlEOvp0o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Immune selection suppresses the emergence of drug resistance in malaria parasites but facilitates its spread</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander O. B. Whitlock, Jonathan J. Juliano, Nicole Mideo&lt;/p&gt;

Although drug resistance in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; typically evolves in regions of low transmission, resistance spreads readily following introduction to regions with a heavier disease burden. This suggests that the origin and the spread of resistance are governed by different processes, and that high transmission intensity specifically impedes the origin. Factors associated with high transmission, such as highly immune hosts and competition within genetically diverse infections, are associated with suppression of resistant lineages within hosts. However, interactions between these factors have rarely been investigated and the specific relationship between adaptive immunity and selection for resistance has not been explored. Here, we developed a multiscale, agent-based model of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasites, hosts, and vectors to examine how host and parasite dynamics shape the evolution of resistance in populations with different transmission intensities. We found that selection for antigenic novelty (“immune selection”) suppressed the evolution of resistance in high transmission settings. We show that high levels of population immunity increased the strength of immune selection relative to selection for resistance. As a result, immune selection delayed the evolution of resistance in high transmission populations by allowing novel, sensitive lineages to remain in circulation at the expense of the spread of a resistant lineage.
In contrast, in low transmission settings, we observed that resistant strains were able to sweep to high population prevalence without interference. Additionally, we found that the relationship between immune selection and resistance changed when resistance was widespread. Once resistance was common enough to be found on many antigenic backgrounds, immune selection stably maintained resistant parasites in the population by allowing them to proliferate, even in untreated hosts, when resistance was linked to a novel epitope. Our results suggest that immune selection plays a role in the global pattern of resistance evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/89yNGIjXRys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Do psychiatric diseases follow annual cyclic seasonality?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanxin Zhang, Atif Khan, Qi Chen, Henrik Larsson, Andrey Rzhetsky&lt;/p&gt;

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) famously follows annual cycles, with incidence elevation in the fall and spring. Should some version of cyclic annual pattern be expected from other psychiatric disorders? Would annual cycles be similar for distinct psychiatric conditions? This study probes these questions using 2 very large datasets describing the health histories of 150 million unique U.S. citizens and the entire Swedish population. We performed 2 types of analysis, using “uncorrected” and “corrected” observations. The former analysis focused on counts of daily patient visits associated with each disease. The latter analysis instead looked at the proportion of disease-specific visits within the total volume of visits for a time interval. In the uncorrected analysis, we found that psychiatric disorders’ annual patterns were remarkably similar across the studied diseases in both countries, with the magnitude of annual variation significantly higher in Sweden than in the United States for psychiatric, but not infectious diseases. In the corrected analysis, only 1 group of patients—11 to 20 years old—reproduced all regularities we observed for psychiatric disorders in the uncorrected analysis; the annual healthcare-seeking visit patterns associated with other age-groups changed drastically. Analogous analyses over infectious diseases were less divergent over these 2 types of computation. Comparing these 2 sets of results in the context of published psychiatric disorder seasonality studies, we tend to believe that our uncorrected results are more likely to capture the real trends, while the corrected results perhaps reflect mostly artifacts determined by dominantly fluctuating, health-seeking visits across a given year. However, the divergent results are ultimately inconclusive; thus, we present both sets of results unredacted, and, in the spirit of full disclosure, leave the verdict to the reader.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/U9ZJHlAGrPY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

High-throughput, spatially resolved gene expression techniques are poised to be transformative across biology by overcoming a central limitation in single-cell biology: the lack of information on relationships that organize the cells into the functional groupings characteristic of tissues in complex multicellular organisms. Spatial expression is particularly interesting in the mammalian brain, which has a highly defined structure, strong spatial constraint in its organization, and detailed multimodal phenotypes for cells and ensembles of cells that can be linked to mesoscale properties such as projection patterns, and from there, to circuits generating behavior. However, as with any type of expression data, cross-dataset benchmarking of spatial data is a crucial first step. Here, we assess the replicability, with reference to canonical brain subdivisions, between the Allen Institute’s in situ hybridization data from the adult mouse brain (Allen Brain Atlas (ABA)) and a similar dataset collected using spatial transcriptomics (ST). With the advent of tractable spatial techniques, for the first time, we are able to benchmark the Allen Institute’s whole-brain, whole-transcriptome spatial expression dataset with a second independent dataset that similarly spans the whole brain and transcriptome. We use regularized linear regression (LASSO), linear regression, and correlation-based feature selection in a supervised learning framework to classify expression samples relative to their assayed location. We show that Allen Reference Atlas labels are classifiable using transcription in both data sets, but that performance is higher in the ABA than in ST. Furthermore, models trained in one dataset and tested in the opposite dataset do not reproduce classification performance bidirectionally. While an identifying expression profile can be found for a given brain area, it does not generalize to the opposite dataset. In general, we found that canonical brain area labels are classifiable in gene expression space within dataset and that our observed performance is not merely reflecting physical distance in the brain. However, we also show that cross-platform classification is not robust. Emerging spatial datasets from the mouse brain will allow further characterization of cross-dataset replicability ultimately providing a valuable reference set for understanding the cell biology of the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BK14-kDlgKE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Testing Surrogate-Based Optimization with the Fortified Branin-Hoo Extended to Four Dimensions. (arXiv:2107.08035v1 [math.OC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some popular functions used to test global optimization algorithms have
multiple local optima, all with the same value, making them all global optima.
It is easy to make them more challenging by fortifying them via adding a
localized bump at the location of one of the optima. In previous work the
authors illustrated this for the Branin-Hoo function and the popular
differential evolution algorithm, showing that the fortified Branin-Hoo
required an order of magnitude more function evaluations. This paper examines
the effect of fortifying the Branin-Hoo function on surrogate-based
optimization, which usually proceeds by adaptive sampling. Two algorithms are
considered. The EGO algorithm, which is based on a Gaussian process (GP) and an
algorithm based on radial basis functions (RBF). EGO is found to be more frugal
in terms of the number of required function evaluations required to identify
the correct basin, but it is expensive to run on a desktop, limiting the number
of times the runs could be repeated to establish sound statistics on the number
of required function evaluations. The RBF algorithm was cheaper to run,
providing more sound statistics on performance. A four-dimensional version of
the Branin-Hoo function was introduced in order to assess the effect of
dimensionality. It was found that the difference between the ordinary function
and the fortified one was much more pronounced for the four-dimensional
function compared to the two dimensional one.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is capable of learning, memorizing, and regenerating a
panoply of temporal patterns. A neuro-dynamical mechanism called conceptors
offers a method for controlling the dynamics of a recurrent neural network by
which a variety of temporal patterns can be learned and recalled. However,
conceptors are matrices whose size scales quadratically with the number of
neurons in the recurrent neural network, hence they quickly become impractical.
In the work reported in this thesis, a variation of conceptors is introduced,
called diagonal conceptors, which are diagonal matrices, thus reducing the
computational cost drastically. It will be shown that diagonal conceptors
achieve the same accuracy as conceptors, but are slightly more unstable. This
instability can be improved, but requires further research. Nevertheless,
diagonal conceptors show to be a promising practical alternative to the
standard full matrix conceptors.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning-based heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems has
recently attracted much academic attention. While most of the existing works
only consider the single objective problem with simple constraints, many
real-world problems have the multiobjective perspective and contain a rich set
of constraints. This paper proposes a multiobjective deep reinforcement
learning with evolutionary learning algorithm for a typical complex problem
called the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows (MO-VRPTW).
In the proposed algorithm, the decomposition strategy is applied to generate
subproblems for a set of attention models. The comprehensive context
information is introduced to further enhance the attention models. The
evolutionary learning is also employed to fine-tune the parameters of the
models. The experimental results on MO-VRPTW instances demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed algorithm over other learning-based and
iterative-based approaches.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the constant advancements of genetic engineering, a common concern is to
be able to identify the lab-of-origin of genetically engineered DNA sequences.
For that reason, AltLabs has hosted the genetic Engineering Attribution
Challenge to gather many teams to propose new tools to solve this problem. Here
we show our proposed method to rank the most likely labs-of-origin and generate
embeddings for DNA sequences and labs. These embeddings can also perform
various other tasks, like clustering both DNA sequences and labs and using them
as features for Machine Learning models applied to solve other problems. This
work demonstrates that our method outperforms the classic training method for
this task while generating other helpful information.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Continual learning in computational systems is challenging due to
catastrophic forgetting. We discovered a two layer neural circuit in the fruit
fly olfactory system that addresses this challenge by uniquely combining sparse
coding and associative learning. In the first layer, odors are encoded using
sparse, high dimensional representations, which reduces memory interference by
activating non overlapping populations of neurons for different odors. In the
second layer, only the synapses between odor activated neurons and the output
neuron associated with the odor are modified during learning; the rest of the
weights are frozen to prevent unrelated memories from being overwritten. We
show empirically and analytically that this simple and lightweight algorithm
significantly boosts continual learning performance. The fly associative
learning algorithm is strikingly similar to the classic perceptron learning
algorithm, albeit two modifications, which we show are critical for reducing
catastrophic forgetting. Overall, fruit flies evolved an efficient lifelong
learning algorithm, and circuit mechanisms from neuroscience can be translated
to improve machine computation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantization based model compression serves as high performing and fast
approach for inference that yields models which are highly compressed when
compared to their full-precision floating point counterparts. The most extreme
quantization is a 1-bit representation of parameters such that they have only
two possible values, typically -1(0) or +1, enabling efficient implementation
of the ubiquitous dot product using only additions. The main contribution of
this work is the introduction of a method to smooth the combinatorial problem
of determining a binary vector of weights to minimize the expected loss for a
given objective by means of empirical risk minimization with backpropagation.
This is achieved by approximating a multivariate binary state over the weights
utilizing a deterministic and differentiable transformation of real-valued,
continuous parameters. The proposed method adds little overhead in training,
can be readily applied without any substantial modifications to the original
architecture, does not introduce additional saturating nonlinearities or
auxiliary losses, and does not prohibit applying other methods for binarizing
the activations. Contrary to common assertions made in the literature, it is
demonstrated that binary weighted networks can train well with the same
standard optimization techniques and similar hyperparameter settings as their
full-precision counterparts, specifically momentum SGD with large learning
rates and $L_2$ regularization. To conclude experiments demonstrate the method
performs remarkably well across a number of inductive image classification
tasks with various architectures compared to their full-precision counterparts.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation to multiple cued reward locations has been increasingly used to
study rodent learning. Though deep reinforcement learning agents have been
shown to be able to learn the task, they are not biologically plausible.
Biologically plausible classic actor-critic agents have been shown to learn to
navigate to single reward locations, but which biologically plausible agents
are able to learn multiple cue-reward location tasks has remained unclear. In
this computational study, we show versions of classic agents that learn to
navigate to a single reward location, and adapt to reward location
displacement, but are not able to learn multiple paired association navigation.
The limitation is overcome by an agent in which place cell and cue information
are first processed by a feedforward nonlinear hidden layer with synapses to
the actor and critic subject to temporal difference error-modulated plasticity.
Faster learning is obtained when the feedforward layer is replaced by a
recurrent reservoir network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spike-timing-dependent plasticity(STDP) is a biological process of synaptic
modification caused by the difference of firing order and timing between
neurons. In our separate work, we have rigorously shown that STDP in a network
of neurons transforms periodic input patterns into a geometrical structure
named memory plane, and a proper memory cue near such structure dynamically
revives the stored information. Using these results, in this paper, we
demonstrate the following two encoding/decoding algorithms handling practical
data. First, we perform an auto-associative memory task with a group of images.
The results show that any relevant image to the group can be used as a cue in
order to reconstruct the original images. The next one deals with the process
of semantic memory representations that are embedded from sentences. The
results show that words can recall multiple sentences simultaneously or one
exclusively, depending on their grammatical relations. This implies that the
proposed framework is apt to process multiple groups of associative memories
with a composite structure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Graph neural networks (GNNs) can process graphs of different sizes, but their
ability to generalize across sizes, specifically from small to large graphs, is
still not well understood. In this paper, we identify an important type of data
where generalization from small to large graphs is challenging: graph
distributions for which the local structure depends on the graph size. This
effect occurs in multiple important graph learning domains, including social
and biological networks. We first prove that when there is a difference between
the local structures, GNNs are not guaranteed to generalize across sizes: there
are &quot;bad&quot; global minima that do well on small graphs but fail on large graphs.
We then study the size-generalization problem empirically and demonstrate that
when there is a discrepancy in local structure, GNNs tend to converge to
non-generalizing solutions. Finally, we suggest two approaches for improving
size generalization, motivated by our findings. Notably, we propose a novel
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) task aimed at learning meaningful
representations of local structures that appear in large graphs. Our SSL task
improves classification accuracy on several popular datasets.

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Cortical interaction of bilateral inputs is similar for noxious and innocuous stimuli but leads to different perceptual effects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06175-9</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebral integration of somatosensory inputs from multiple sources is essential to produce adapted behaviors. Previous studies suggest that bilateral somatosensory inputs interact differently depending on stimulus characteristics, including their noxious nature. The aim of this study was to clarify how bilateral inputs evoked by noxious laser stimuli, noxious shocks, and innocuous shocks interact in terms of perception and brain responses. The experiment comprised two conditions (right-hand stimulation and concurrent stimulation of both hands) in which painful laser stimuli, painful shocks and non-painful shocks were delivered. Perception, somatosensory-evoked potentials (P45, N100, P260), laser-evoked potentials (N1, N2 and P2) and event-related spectral perturbations (delta to gamma oscillation power) were compared between conditions and stimulus modalities. The amplitude of negative vertex potentials (N2 or N100) and the power of delta/theta oscillations were increased in the bilateral compared with unilateral condition, regardless of the stimulus type (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). However, gamma oscillation power increased for painful and non-painful shocks (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), but not for painful laser stimuli (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.08). Despite the similarities in terms of brain activity, bilateral inputs interacted differently for painful stimuli, for which perception remained unchanged, and non-painful stimuli, for which perception increased. This may reflect a ceiling effect for the attentional capture by noxious stimuli and warrants further investigations to examine the regulation of such interactions by bottom–up and top–down processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Shifts in Estimated Preferred Directions During Simulated BMI Experiments With No Adaptation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.677688</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.677688</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experiments with brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) reveal that the estimated preferred direction (EPD) of cortical motor units may shift following the transition to brain control. However, the cause of those shifts, and in particular, whether they imply neural adaptation, is an open issue. Here we address this question in simulations and theoretical analysis. Simulations are based on the assumption that the brain implements optimal state estimation and feedback control and that cortical motor neurons encode the estimated state and control vector. Our simulations successfully reproduce apparent shifts in EPDs observed in BMI experiments with different BMI filters, including linear, Kalman and re-calibrated Kalman filters, even with no neural adaptation. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions for reducing those shifts. We demonstrate that simulations that better satisfy those conditions result in smaller shifts in EPDs. We conclude that the observed shifts in EPDs may result from experimental conditions, and in particular correlated velocities or tuning weights, even with no adaptation. Under the above assumptions, we show that if neurons are tuned differently to the estimated velocity, estimated position and control signal, the EPD with respect to actual velocity may not capture the real PD in which the neuron encodes the estimated velocity. Our investigation provides theoretical and simulation tools for better understanding shifts in EPD and BMI experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: From Junk to Function: LncRNAs in CNS Health and Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.714768</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.714768</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies helped to uncover the existence of tens of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that arise from the dark matter of the genome. These lncRNAs were originally thought to be transcriptional noise but an increasing number of studies demonstrate that these transcripts can modulate protein-coding gene expression by a wide variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The spatiotemporal regulation of lncRNA expression is particularly evident in the central nervous system, suggesting that they may directly contribute to specific brain processes, including neurogenesis and cellular homeostasis. Not surprisingly, lncRNAs are therefore gaining attention as putative novel therapeutic targets for disorders of the brain. In this review, we summarize the recent insights into the functions of lncRNAs in the brain, their role in neuronal maintenance, and their potential contribution to disease. We conclude this review by postulating how these RNA molecules can be targeted for the treatment of yet incurable neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Expression Analysis of Ermin and Listerin E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1 Genes in Autistic Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that involves social interaction defects, impairment of non-verbal and verbal interactions, and limited interests along with stereotypic activities. Its incidence has been increasing rapidly in recent decades. Despite numerous attempts to understand the pathophysiology of ASD, its exact etiology is still unclear. Recent data shows the role of accurate myelination and translational regulation in ASD’s pathogenesis. In this study, we assessed Ermin (ERMN) and Listerin E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1 (LTN1) genes expression in Iranian ASD patients and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects’ peripheral blood using quantitative real-time PCR to recognize any probable dysregulation in the expression of these genes and propose this disorder’s mechanisms. Analysis of the expression demonstrated a significant ERMN downregulation in total ASD patients compared to the healthy individuals (posterior beta = −0.794, adjusted P-value = 0.025). LTN1 expression was suggestively higher in ASD patients in comparison with the corresponding control individuals. Considering the gender of study participants, the analysis showed that the mentioned genes’ different expression levels were significant only in male subjects. Besides, a significant correlation was found between expression of the mentioned genes (r = −0.49, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The present study provides further supports for the contribution of ERMN and LTN1 in ASD’s pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT &lt;sub&gt;non−RE&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 21) and post-RT &lt;sub&gt;REproved&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;infollow−up&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Insulin Resistance Exacerbates Alzheimer Disease via Multiple Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687157</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for 60–70% of dementia and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogenesis of this debilitating disorder is still not completely understood. New insights into the pathogenesis of AD are needed in order to develop novel pharmacologic approaches. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that insulin resistance plays a significant role in the development of AD. Over 80% of patients with AD have type II diabetes (T2DM) or abnormal serum glucose, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms of insulin resistance and AD likely overlap. Insulin resistance increases neuroinflammation, which promotes both amyloid β-protein deposition and aberrant tau phosphorylation. By increasing production of reactive oxygen species, insulin resistance triggers amyloid β-protein accumulation. Oxidative stress associated with insulin resistance also dysregulates glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK-3β), which leads to increased tau phosphorylation. Both insulin and amyloid β-protein are metabolized by insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). Defects in this enzyme are the basis for a strong association between T2DM and AD. This review highlights multiple pathogenic mechanisms induced by insulin resistance that are implicated in AD. Several pharmacologic approaches to AD associated with insulin resistance are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bilingualism and multilingualism are highly prevalent. Non-invasive brain imaging has been used to study the neural correlates of native and non-native speech and language production, mainly on the lexical and syntactic level. Here, we acquired continuous fast event-related FMRI during visually cued overt production of exclusively German and English vowels and syllables. We analyzed data from 13 university students, native speakers of German and sequential English bilinguals. The production of non-native English sounds was associated with increased activity of the left primary sensorimotor cortex, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres (lobule VI), left inferior frontal gyrus, and left anterior insula compared to native German sounds. The contrast German &amp;gt; English sounds was not statistically significant. Our results emphasize that the production of non-native speech requires additional neural resources already on a basic phonological level in sequential bilinguals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging in the Diffusion Imaging in Python Project</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.675433</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measurements and models provide information about brain connectivity and are sensitive to the physical properties of tissue microstructure. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue from dMRI. These estimates are of interest because they were shown to be more sensitive to microstructural alterations in health and diseases than measures based on the total anisotropy of diffusion which are highly confounded by tissue dispersion and fiber crossings. In this work, we implemented DKI in the Diffusion in Python (DIPY) project—a large collaborative open-source project which aims to provide well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive implementation of different dMRI techniques. We demonstrate the functionality of our methods in numerical simulations with known ground truth parameters and in openly available datasets. A particular strength of our DKI implementations is that it pursues several extensions of the model that connect it explicitly with microstructural models and the reconstruction of 3D white matter fiber bundles (tractography). For instance, our implementations include DKI-based microstructural models that allow the estimation of biophysical parameters, such as axonal water fraction. Moreover, we illustrate how DKI provides more general characterization of non-Gaussian diffusion compatible with complex white matter fiber architectures and gray matter, and we include a novel mean kurtosis index that is invariant to the confounding effects due to tissue dispersion. In summary, DKI in DIPY provides a well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive reference implementation for DKI. It provides a platform for wider use of DKI in research on brain disorders and in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Open Source-Based BCI Application for Virtual World Tour and Its Usability Evaluation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain–computer interfaces can provide a new communication channel and control functions to people with restricted movements. Recent studies have indicated the effectiveness of brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. Various types of applications have been introduced so far in this field, but the number of those available to the public is still insufficient. Thus, there is a need to expand the usability and accessibility of BCI applications. In this study, we introduce a BCI application for users to experience a virtual world tour. This software was built on three open-source environments and is publicly available through the GitHub repository. For a usability test, 10 healthy subjects participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment and evaluated the system through a questionnaire. As a result, all the participants successfully played the BCI application with 96.6% accuracy with 20 blinks from two sessions and gave opinions on its usability (e.g., controllability, completeness, comfort, and enjoyment) through the questionnaire. We believe that this open-source BCI world tour system can be used in both research and entertainment settings and hopefully contribute to open science in the BCI field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mood Regulatory Actions of Active and Sham Nucleus Accumbens Deep Brain Stimulation in Antidepressant Resistant Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644921</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant actions of deep brain stimulation (DBS) are associated with progressive neuroadaptations within the mood network, modulated in part, by neurotrophic mechanisms. We investigated the antidepressant-like effects of chronic nucleus accumbens (NAc) DBS and its association with change in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL), and the dorsal (dHIP) and ventral (vHIP) subregions of the hippocampus of antidepressant resistant rats. Antidepressant resistance was induced via daily injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 100 μg/day; 15 days) and confirmed by non-response to tricyclic antidepressant treatment (imipramine, 10 mg/kg). Portable microdevices provided continuous bilateral NAc DBS (130 Hz, 200 μA, 90 μs) for 7 days. A control sham electrode group was included, together with ACTH- and saline-treated control groups. Home cage monitoring, open field, sucrose preference, and, forced swim behavioral tests were performed. Post-mortem levels of GSK3 and mTOR, total and phosphorylated, were determined with Western blot. As previously reported, ACTH treatment blocked the immobility-reducing effects of imipramine in the forced swim test. In contrast, treatment with either active DBS or sham electrode placement in the NAc significantly reduced forced swim immobility time in ACTH-treated animals. This was associated with increased homecage activity in the DBS and sham groups relative to ACTH and saline groups, however, no differences in locomotor activity were observed in the open field test, nor were any group differences seen for sucrose consumption across groups. The antidepressant-like actions of NAc DBS and sham electrode placements were associated with an increase in levels of IL and vHIP phospho-GSK3β and phospho-mTOR, however, no differences in these protein levels were observed in the dHIP region. These data suggest that early response to electrode placement in the NAc, irrespective of whether active DBS or sham, has antidepressant-like effects in the ACTH-model of antidepressant resistance associated with distal upregulation of phospho-GSK3β and phospho-mTOR in the IL and vHIP regions of the mood network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: RNA Is a Double-Edged Sword in ALS Pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.708181</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons. Familial ALS accounts for a small subset of cases (&amp;lt;10–15%) and is caused by dominant mutations in one of more than 10 known genes. Multiple genes have been causally or pathologically linked to both ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Many of these genes encode RNA-binding proteins, so the role of dysregulated RNA metabolism in neurodegeneration is being actively investigated. In addition to defects in RNA metabolism, recent studies provide emerging evidence into how RNA itself can contribute to the degeneration of both motor and cortical neurons. In this review, we discuss the roles of altered RNA metabolism and RNA-mediated toxicity in the context of TARDBP, FUS, and C9ORF72 mutations. Specifically, we focus on recent studies that describe toxic RNA as the potential initiator of disease, disease-associated defects in specific RNA metabolism pathways, as well as how RNA-based approaches can be used as potential therapies. Altogether, we highlight the importance of RNA-based investigations into the molecular progression of ALS, as well as the need for RNA-dependent structural studies of disease-linked RNA-binding proteins to identify clear therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) is the predominant pathologic protein in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The production and deposition of Aβ are important factors affecting AD progression and prognosis. The deposition of neurotoxic Aβ contributes to damage of the blood–brain barrier. However, the BBB is also crucial in maintaining the normal metabolism of Aβ, and dysfunction of the BBB aggravates Aβ deposition. This review characterizes Aβ deposition and BBB damage in AD, summarizes their interactions, and details their respective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Structural E/I Balance Constrains the Early Development of Cortical Network Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.687306</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neocortical networks have a characteristic constant ratio in the number of glutamatergic projection neurons (PN) and GABAergic interneurons (IN), and deviations in this ratio are often associated with developmental neuropathologies. Cultured networks with defined cellular content allowed us to ask if initial PN/IN ratios change the developmental population dynamics, and how different ratios impact the physiological excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and the network activity development. During the first week in vitro, the IN content modulated PN numbers, increasing their proliferation in networks with higher IN proportions. The proportion of INs in each network set remained similar to the initial plating ratio during the 4 weeks cultivation period. Results from additional networks generated with more diverse cellular composition, including early-born GABA neurons, suggest that a GABA-dependent mechanism may decrease the survival of additional INs. A large variation of the PN/IN ratio did not change the balance between isolated spontaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents charge transfer (E/I balance) measured in PNs or INs. In contrast, the E/I balance of multisynaptic bursts reflected differences in IN content. Additionally, the spontaneous activity recorded by calcium imaging showed that higher IN ratios were associated with increased frequency of network bursts combined with a decrease of participating neurons per event. In the 4th week in vitro, bursting activity was stereotypically synchronized in networks with very few INs but was more desynchronized in networks with higher IN proportions. These results suggest that the E/I balance of isolated postsynaptic currents in single cells may be regulated independently of PN/IN proportions, but the network bursts E/I balance and the maturation of spontaneous network activity critically depends upon the structural PN/IN ratio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of acupuncture on peripheral immune function, inflammation, and cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VD) rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this study, 2-month-old healthy male Wistar rats (260–280 g) were assigned to the groups as follows: normal group (Gn, n = 10), sham-operated group (Gs, n = 10), and operated group (Go, n = 45). The Go group was established by permanent, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Two months after operation, the operated rats were screened by hidden platform trial and the rats with cognitive dysfunction were further randomly divided into impaired group (Gi), acupoint group (Ga), and non-acupoint group (Gna) with 10 rats in each group. The Ga group was given acupuncture treatment for 14 days with a rest for every 7 days. After treatment, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to evaluate the spatial learning and memory abilities of rats. The lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and spleen of rats were measured by flow cytometry. The levels of cytokines [i.e., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (INF-γ)], chemokines (i.e., macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)), and other inflammatory mediators (i.e., cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) in peripheral blood and hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the Gn group, the Gi rats presented long escape latencies to find the platform. After acupuncture treatment, the escape latencies of the Ga group were rescued markedly when compared with the Gi group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The proportion of CD4 + T lymphocytes in both spleen and peripheral blood in the Ga group increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in comparison with the Gi group. There is an obvious reduction in IL-1β (P &amp;lt; 0.05), IL-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), TNF-α (P &amp;lt; 0.01), INF-γ (P &amp;lt; 0.01), MIP-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and iNOS (P &amp;lt; 0.01), coming along with the increased levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in the Ga group when compared with the Gi group. In addition, the hippocampus proinflammatory factors IL-1β (P &amp;lt; 0.01), IL-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.01), TNF-α (P &amp;lt; 0.05), INF-γ (P &amp;lt; 0.05), MIP-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), iNOS (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and COX-2 decreased in the Ga group, whereas the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 (P &amp;lt; 0.01) increased.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There are abnormal immune function and peripheral inflammation in VD rats. Acupuncture can regulate the peripheral immune function and inflammation of the VD rats and can improve the cognitive dysfunction of the rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Assessing glymphatic function using in-vivo imaging method is of great value for understanding its contribution to major brain diseases. In the present study, we aim to validate the association between a variety of risk factors and a potential index of glymphatic function—Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis Along the Perivascular Space (ALPS index). We enrolled 142 subjects from communities and performed multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging scans. The ALPS index was calculated from diffusion tensor imaging data, and its associations with demographic factors, vascular factors were investigated using regression analyses. We found that the ALPS index was negatively associated with age (β = −0.284, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to males, females had significantly higher ALPS index (β = −0.243, p = 0.001). Hypertensive subjects had significantly lower ALPS index compared to non-hypertensive subjects (β = −0.189, p = 0.013). Furthermore, venous disruption could decrease ALPS index (β = −0.215, p = 0.003). In general, our results are in consistent with previous conceptions and results from animal studies about the pathophysiology of glymphatic dysfunction. Future studies utilizing this method should consider introducing the above-mentioned factors as important covariates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of slow-progressing terminal illnesses characterized by neuronal lesions, such as multiple sclerosis [MS, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Their incidence increases with age, and the associated burden on families and society will become increasingly more prominent with aging of the general population. In recent years, there is growing studies have shown that lactosylceramide (LacCer) plays a crucial role in the progression of neurodegeneration, although these diseases have different pathogenic mechanisms and etiological characteristics. Based on latest research progress, this study expounds the pathogenic role of LacCer in driving central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, as well as the role of membrane microstructure domain (lipid rafts) and metabolite gangliosides, and discusses in detail their links with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with a view to providing new strategies and ideas for the study of pathological mechanisms and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background/Objectives&lt;p&gt;Little is known regarding the prevalence and predictors of prolonged cognitive and psychological symptoms of COVID-19 among community-dwellers. We aimed to quantitatively measure self-reported metrics of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep and identify factors associated with these metrics among United States residents with or without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We solicited 1000 adult United States residents for an online survey conducted February 3–5, 2021 utilizing a commercial crowdsourcing community research platform. The platform curates eligible participants to approximate United States demographics by age, sex, and race proportions. COVID-19 was diagnosed by laboratory testing and/or by exposure to a known positive contact with subsequent typical symptoms. Prolonged COVID-19 was self-reported and coded for those with symptoms ≥ 1 month following initial diagnosis. The primary outcomes were NIH PROMIS/Neuro-QoL short-form T-scores for fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep compared among those with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 without prolonged symptoms and COVID-19 negative subjects. Multivariable backwards step-wise logistic regression models were constructed to predict abnormal Neuro-QoL metrics.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among 999 respondents, the average age was 45 years (range 18–84), 49% were male, 76 (7.6%) had a history of COVID-19 and 19/76 (25%) COVID-19 positive participants reported prolonged symptoms lasting a median of 4 months (range 1–13). Prolonged COVID-19 participants were more often younger, female, Hispanic, and had a history of depression/mood/thought disorder (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). They experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment and financial insecurity, and their symptoms created greater interference with work and household activities compared to other COVID-19 status groups (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for demographics, past medical history and stressor covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 status was independently predictive of worse Neuro-QoL cognitive dysfunction scores (adjusted OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.01–2.28, P = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, or sleep.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Prolonged symptoms occurred in 25% of COVID-19 positive participants, and NeuroQoL cognitive dysfunction scores were significantly worse among COVID-19 positive subjects, even after accounting for demographic and stressor covariates. Fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep scores did not differ between COVID-19 positive and negative respondents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) affect speech and language as well as motor functions. Clinical and neuropathological data indicate a close relationship between these two disorders and the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). We use the recently developed Mini Linguistic State Examination tool (MLSE) to study speech and language disorders in patients with PSP, CBS, and nfvPPA, in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fifty-one patients (PSP N = 13, CBS N = 19, nfvPPA N = 19) and 30 age-matched controls completed the MLSE, the short form of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE), and the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III. Thirty-eight patients and all controls underwent structural MRI at 3 Tesla, with T1 and T2-weighted images processed by surface-based and subcortical segmentation within FreeSurfer 6.0.0 to extract cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. Morphometric differences were compared between groups and correlated with the severity of speech and language impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: CBS and PSP patients showed impaired MLSE performance, compared to controls, with a similar language profile to nfvPPA, albeit less severe. All patient groups showed reduced cortical thickness in bilateral frontal regions and striatal volume. PSP and nfvPPA patients also showed reduced superior temporal cortical thickness, with additional thalamic and amygdalo-hippocampal volume reductions in nfvPPA. Multivariate analysis of brain-wide cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with MLSE domain scores revealed associations between performance on multiple speech and language domains with atrophy of left-lateralised fronto-temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, and caudate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The effect of PSP and CBS on speech and language overlaps with nfvPPA. These three disorders cause a common anatomical pattern of atrophy in the left frontotemporal language network and striatum. The MLSE is a short clinical screening tool that can identify the language disorder of PSP and CBS, facilitating clinical management and patient access to future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: The need for high-quality oocyte mitochondria at extreme ploidy dictates mammalian germline development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69344</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69344</link>
	<description>Selection against deleterious mitochondrial mutations is facilitated by germline processes, lowering the risk of genetic diseases. How selection works is disputed: experimental data are conflicting and previous modelling work has not clarified the issues. Here we develop computational and evolutionary models that compare the outcome of selection at the level of individuals, cells and mitochondria. Using realistic &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutation rates and germline development parameters from mouse and humans, the evolutionary model predicts the observed prevalence of mitochondrial mutations and diseases in human populations. We show the importance of organelle-level selection, seen in the selective pooling of mitochondria into the Balbiani body, in achieving high-quality mitochondria at extreme ploidy in mature oocytes. Alternative mechanisms debated in the literature, bottlenecks and follicular atresia, are unlikely to account for the clinical data, because neither process effectively eliminates mitochondrial mutations under realistic conditions. Our findings explain the major features of female germline architecture, notably the longstanding paradox of over-proliferation of primordial germ cells followed by massive loss. The near-universality of these processes across animal taxa makes sense in light of the need to maintain mitochondrial quality at extreme ploidy in mature oocytes, in the absence of sex and recombination.</description>

	<title>eLife: Analysis of the PcrA-RNA polymerase complex reveals a helicase interaction motif and a role for PcrA/UvrD helicase in the suppression of R-loops</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68829</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68829</link>
	<description>The PcrA/UvrD helicase binds directly to RNA polymerase (RNAP) but the structural basis for this interaction and its functional significance have remained unclear. In this work we used biochemical assays and hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry to study the PcrA-RNAP complex. We find that PcrA binds tightly to a transcription elongation complex in a manner dependent on protein:protein interaction with the conserved PcrA C-terminal Tudor domain. The helicase binds predominantly to two positions on the surface of RNAP. The PcrA C-terminal domain engages a conserved region in a lineage-specific insert within the β subunit which we identify as a helicase interaction motif present in many other PcrA partner proteins, including the nucleotide excision repair factor UvrB. The catalytic core of the helicase binds near the RNA and DNA exit channels and blocking PcrA activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; leads to the accumulation of R-loops. We propose a role for PcrA as an R-loop suppression factor that helps to minimise conflicts between transcription and other processes on DNA including replication.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ferroptotic stress promotes the accumulation of pro-inflammatory proximal tubular cells in maladaptive renal repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68603</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68603</link>
	<description>Overwhelming lipid peroxidation induces ferroptotic stress and ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death that has been implicated in maladaptive renal repair in mice and humans. Using single-cell transcriptomic and mouse genetic approaches, we show that proximal tubular (PT) cells develop a molecularly distinct, pro-inflammatory state following injury. While these inflammatory PT cells transiently appear after mild injury and return to their original state without inducing fibrosis, after severe injury they accumulate and contribute to persistent inflammation. This transient inflammatory PT state significantly downregulates glutathione metabolism genes, making the cells vulnerable to ferroptotic stress. Genetic induction of high ferroptotic stress in these cells after mild injury leads to the accumulation of the inflammatory PT cells, enhancing inflammation and fibrosis. Our study broadens the roles of ferroptotic stress from being a trigger of regulated cell death to include the promotion and accumulation of proinflammatory cells that underlie maladaptive repair.</description>

	<title>eLife: Niche partitioning facilitates coexistence of closely related honey bee gut bacteria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68583</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68583</link>
	<description>Ecological processes underlying bacterial coexistence in the gut are not well understood. Here, we disentangled the effect of the host and the diet on the coexistence of four closely related &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; species colonizing the honey bee gut. We serially passaged the four species through gnotobiotic bees and in liquid cultures in the presence of either pollen (bee diet) or simple sugars. Although the four species engaged in negative interactions, they were able to stably coexist, both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, coexistence was only possible in the presence of pollen, and not in simple sugars, independent of the environment. Using metatranscriptomics and metabolomics, we found that the four species utilize different pollen-derived carbohydrate substrates indicating resource partitioning as the basis of coexistence. Our results show that despite longstanding host association, gut bacterial interactions can be recapitulated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; providing insights about bacterial coexistence when combined with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cortex cis-regulatory switches establish scale colour identity and pattern diversity in Heliconius</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68549</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68549</link>
	<description>In &lt;i&gt;Heliconius&lt;/i&gt; butterflies, wing colour pattern diversity and scale types are controlled by a few genes of large effect that regulate colour pattern switches between morphs and species across a large mimetic radiation. One of these genes, &lt;i&gt;cortex&lt;/i&gt;, has been repeatedly associated with colour pattern evolution in butterflies. Here we carried out CRISPR knockouts in multiple &lt;i&gt;Heliconius&lt;/i&gt; species and show that &lt;i&gt;cortex&lt;/i&gt; is a major determinant of scale cell identity. Chromatin accessibility profiling and introgression scans identified &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory regions associated with discrete phenotypic switches. CRISPR perturbation of these regions in black hindwing genotypes recreated a yellow bar, revealing their spatially limited activity. In the &lt;i&gt;H. melpomene/timareta&lt;/i&gt; lineage, the candidate CRE from yellow-barred phenotype morphs is interrupted by a transposable element, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory structural variation underlies these mimetic adaptations. Our work shows that &lt;i&gt;cortex&lt;/i&gt; functionally controls scale colour fate and that its &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory regions control a phenotypic switch in a modular and pattern-specific fashion.</description>

	<title>eLife: High-resolution, genome-wide mapping of positive supercoiling in chromosomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67236</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67236</link>
	<description>Supercoiling impacts DNA replication, transcription, protein binding to DNA, and the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes. However, there are currently no methods to directly interrogate or map positive supercoils, so their distribution in genomes remains unknown. Here, we describe a method, GapR-seq, based on the chromatin immunoprecipitation of GapR, a bacterial protein that preferentially recognizes overtwisted DNA, for generating high-resolution maps of positive supercoiling. Applying this method to &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we find that positive supercoiling is widespread, associated with transcription, and particularly enriched between convergently-oriented genes, consistent with the 'twin-domain' model of supercoiling. In yeast, we also find positive supercoils associated with centromeres, cohesin binding sites, autonomously replicating sites, and the borders of R-loops (DNA-RNA hybrids). Our results suggest that GapR-seq is a powerful approach, likely applicable in any organism, to investigate aspects of chromosome structure and organization not accessible by Hi-C or other existing methods.</description>

	<description>Carboxy ester prodrugs are widely employed to increase oral absorption and potency of phosphonate antibiotics. Prodrugging can mask problematic chemical features that prevent cellular uptake and may enable tissue specific compound delivery. However, many carboxy ester promoieties are rapidly hydrolyzed by serum esterases, limiting their therapeutic potential. While carboxy ester-based prodrug targeting is feasible, it has seen limited use in microbes as microbial esterase specific promoieties have not been described. Here we identify the bacterial esterases, GloB and FrmB, that activate carboxy ester prodrugs in &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus. &lt;/i&gt;Additionally, we determine the substrate specificities for FrmB and GloB and demonstrate the structural basis of these preferences. Finally, we establish the carboxy ester substrate specificities of human and mouse sera, ultimately identifying several promoieties likely to be serum esterase-resistant and microbially labile. These studies will enable structure-guided design of anti-staphylococcal promoieties and expand the range of molecules to target staphylococcal pathogens.</description>

	<title>eLife: Differential conditioning produces merged long-term memory in Drosophila</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66499</link>
	<description>Multiple spaced trials of aversive differential conditioning can produce two independent long-term memories (LTMs) of opposite valence. One is an aversive memory for avoiding the conditioned stimulus (CS+), and the other is a safety memory for approaching the non-conditioned stimulus (CS-). Here, we show that a single trial of aversive differential conditioning yields one merged LTM (mLTM) for avoiding both CS+ and CS-. Such mLTM can be detected after sequential exposures to the shock-paired CS+ and unpaired CS-, and be retrieved by either CS+ or CS-. The formation of mLTM relies on triggering aversive-reinforcing dopaminergic neurons and subsequent new protein synthesis. Expressing mLTM involves αβ Kenyon cells and corresponding approach-directing mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), in which similar-amplitude long-term depression of responses to CS+ and CS- seems to signal the mLTM. Our results suggest that animals can develop distinct strategies for occasional and repeated threatening experiences.</description>

	<title>eLife: Highly contiguous assemblies of 101 drosophilid genomes</title>

	<description>Over 100 years of studies in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and related species in the genus &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; have facilitated key discoveries in genetics, genomics, and evolution. While high-quality genome assemblies exist for several species in this group, they only encompass a small fraction of the genus. Recent advances in long-read sequencing allow high-quality genome assemblies for tens or even hundreds of species to be efficiently generated. Here, we utilize Oxford Nanopore sequencing to build an open community resource of genome assemblies for 101 lines of 93 drosophilid species encompassing 14 species groups and 35 sub-groups. The genomes are highly contiguous and complete, with an average contig N50 of 10.5 Mb and greater than 97% BUSCO completeness in 97/101 assemblies. We show that Nanopore-based assemblies are highly accurate in coding regions, particularly with respect to coding insertions and deletions. These assemblies, along with a detailed laboratory protocol and assembly pipelines, are released as a public resource and will serve as a starting point for addressing broad questions of genetics, ecology, and evolution at the scale of hundreds of species.</description>

	<title>eLife: Plasmodium falciparum K13 mutations in Africa and Asia impact artemisinin resistance and parasite fitness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66277</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66277</link>
	<description>The emergence of mutant K13-mediated artemisinin (ART) resistance in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum &lt;/i&gt;malaria parasites has led to widespread treatment failure across Southeast Asia. In Africa, &lt;i&gt;K13-&lt;/i&gt;propeller genotyping confirms the emergence of the R561H mutation in Rwanda and highlights the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 elsewhere. Using gene editing, we show that R561H, along with C580Y and M579I, confer elevated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ART resistance in some African strains, contrasting with minimal changes in ART susceptibility in others. C580Y and M579I cause substantial fitness costs, which may slow their dissemination in high-transmission settings, in contrast with R561H that in African 3D7 parasites is fitness neutral. In Cambodia, &lt;i&gt;K13&lt;/i&gt; genotyping highlights the increasing spatio-temporal dominance of C580Y. Editing multiple K13 mutations into a panel of Southeast Asian strains reveals that only the R561H variant yields ART resistance comparable to C580Y. In Asian Dd2 parasites C580Y shows no fitness cost, in contrast with most other K13 mutations tested, including R561H. Editing point mutations in &lt;i&gt;ferredoxin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;mdr2&lt;/i&gt;, earlier associated with resistance, has no impact on ART susceptibility or parasite fitness. These data underline the complex interplay between K13 mutations, parasite survival, growth and genetic background in contributing to the spread of ART resistance.</description>

	<title>eLife: Distinct skeletal stem cell types orchestrate long bone skeletogenesis</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66063</link>
	<description>Skeletal stem and progenitor cell populations are crucial for bone physiology. Characterization of these cell types remains restricted to heterogenous bulk populations with limited information on whether they are unique or overlap with previously characterized cell types. Here we show, through comprehensive functional and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, that postnatal long bones of mice contain at least two types of bone progenitors with bona fide skeletal stem cell (SSC) characteristics. An early osteochondral SSC (ocSSC) facilitates long bone growth and repair, while a second type, a perivascular SSC (pvSSC), co-emerges with long bone marrow and contributes to shape the hematopoietic stem cell niche and regenerative demand. We establish that pvSSCs, but not ocSSCs, are the origin of bone marrow adipose tissue. Lastly, we also provide insight into residual SSC heterogeneity as well as potential crosstalk between the two spatially distinct cell populations. These findings comprehensively address previously unappreciated shortcomings of SSC research.</description>

	<title>eLife: Development of antibacterial compounds that constrain evolutionary pathways to resistance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64518</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64518</link>
	<description>Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide challenge. A potential approach to block resistance is to simultaneously inhibit WT and known escape variants of the target bacterial protein. Here we applied an integrated computational and experimental approach to discover compounds that inhibit both WT and trimethoprim (TMP) resistant mutants of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We identified a novel compound (CD15-3) that inhibits WT DHFR and its TMP resistant variants L28R, P21L and A26T with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 50-75 µM against WT and TMP-resistant strains. Resistance to CD15-3 was dramatically delayed compared to TMP in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evolution. Whole genome sequencing of CD15-3 resistant strains showed no mutations in the target folA locus. Rather, gene duplication of several efflux pumps gave rise to weak (about twofold increase in IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) resistance against CD15-3. Altogether, our results demonstrate the promise of strategy to develop evolution drugs - compounds which constrain evolutionary escape routes in pathogens.</description>

	<title>eLife: KSHV-encoded vCyclin can modulate HIF1α levels to promote DNA replication in hypoxia</title>

	<description>The cellular adaptive response to hypoxia, mediated by high HIF1α levels includes metabolic reprogramming, restricted DNA replication and cell division. In contrast to healthy cells, the genome of cancer cells, and Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infected cells maintains replication in hypoxia. We show that KSHV infection, despite promoting expression of HIF1α in normoxia, can also restrict transcriptional activity, and promoted its degradation in hypoxia. KSHV-encoded vCyclin, expressed in hypoxia, mediated HIF1a cytosolic translocation, and its degradation through a non-canonical lysosomal pathway. Attenuation of HIF1α levels by vCyclin allowed cells to bypass the block to DNA replication and cell proliferation in hypoxia. These results demonstrated that KSHV utilizes a unique strategy to balance HIF1α levels to overcome replication arrest and induction of the oncogenic phenotype, which are dependent on the levels of oxygen in the microenvironment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) enhances cocaine effects in the nucleus accumbens via a dopamine release-based mechanism</title>

	<description>Cocaine use disorder is associated with alterations in immune function including altered expression of multiple peripheral cytokines in humans - several of which correlate with drug use. Individuals suffering from cocaine use disorder show altered immune system responses to drug-associated cues, highlighting the interaction between the brain and immune system as a critical factor in the development and expression of cocaine use disorder. We have previously demonstrated in animal models that cocaine use upregulates expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) - a pleiotropic cytokine - in the serum and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). G-CSF signaling has been causally linked to behavioral responses to cocaine across multiple behavioral domains. The goal of this study was to define whether increases in G-CSF alter the pharmacodynamic effects of cocaine on the dopamine system and whether this occurs via direct mechanisms within local NAc microcircuits. We find that systemic G-CSF injection increases cocaine effects on dopamine terminals. The enhanced dopamine levels in the presence of cocaine occur through a release-based mechanism, rather than through effects on the dopamine transporter - as uptake rates were unchanged following G-CSF treatment. Critically, this effect could be recapitulated by acute bath application of G-CSF to dopamine terminals, an effect that was occluded by prior G-CSF treatment, suggesting a similar mechanistic basis for direct and systemic exposures. This work highlights the critical interaction between the immune system and psychostimulant effects that can alter drug responses and may play a role in vulnerability to cocaine use disorder.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cellular and behavioral effects of altered NaV1.2 sodium channel ion permeability in Scn2aK1422E mice</title>

	<description>Genetic variants in SCN2A, encoding the NaV1.2 voltage-gated sodium channel, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Some variants fit into a framework wherein gain-of-function missense variants that increase neuronal excitability lead to infantile epileptic encephalopathy, while loss-of-function variants that reduce neuronal excitability lead to developmental delay and/or autism spectrum disorder with or without co-morbid seizures. One unique case less easily classified using this binary paradigm is the de novo missense variant SCN2A-p.K1422E, associated with infant-onset developmental delay, infantile spasms, and features of autism spectrum disorder. Prior structure-function studies demonstrated that K1422E substitution alters ion selectivity of NaV1.2, conferring Ca2+ permeability, lowering overall conductance, and conferring resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on heterologous expression of K1422E, we developed a compartmental neuron model that predicted mixed effects on channel function and neuronal activity. We also generated Scn2aK1422E mice and characterized effects on neurons and neurological/neurobehavioral phenotypes. Dissociated neurons from heterozygous Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited a novel TTX-resistant current with a reversal potential consistent with mixed ion permeation. Cortical slice recordings from Scn2aK1422E/+ tissue demonstrated impaired action potential initiation and larger Ca2+ transients at the axon initial segment during the rising phase of the action potential, suggesting mixed effects on channel function. Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited rare spontaneous seizures, interictal EEG abnormalities, altered response to induced seizures, reduced anxiety-like behavior and alterations in olfactory-guided social behavior. Overall, Scn2aK1422E/+ mice present with phenotypes similar yet distinct from Scn2a knockout models, consistent with mixed effects of K1422E on NaV1.2 channel function.</description>

	<description>Sensory input provides incomplete and often misleading information about the physical world. To compensate, the brain uses internal models to predict what the inputs should be from context, experience, and innate biases. For example, when speech is interrupted by noise, humans perceive the missing sounds behind the noise, a perceptual illusion known as phonemic (or auditory) restoration. The neural mechanisms allowing the auditory system to generate predictions that override ascending sensory information remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) exhibits auditory restoration of conspecific song both in a behavioral task and in neural recordings from the equivalent of auditory cortex. Decoding the responses of a population of single units to occluded songs reveals the spectrotemporal structure of the missing syllables. Surprisingly, restoration occurs under anesthesia and for songs that the bird has not heard. These results show that an internal model of the general structure of conspecific vocalizations can bias sensory processing without attention.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The critical role of spiny stellate cells in seizure onset based on dynamic analysis of a neural mass model</title>

	<description>Increasing evidence has shown that excitatory neurons in the brain play a significant role in seizure generation. However, spiny stellate cells are cortical excitatory non-pyramidal neurons in the brain which their basic role in seizure occurrence is not well understood. In the present research, we study the critical role of spiny stellate cells or the excitatory interneurons (EI), for the first time, in epileptic seizure generation using an extended neural mass model introduced originally by Taylor and colleagues in 2014. Applying bifurcation analysis on this modified model, we investigated the rich dynamics corresponding to the epileptic seizure onset and transition between interictal and ictal states due to the EI. Our results indicate that the transition is described by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation which shapes the preictal activity in the model and suggests why before seizure onset, the amplitude and frequency of neural activities increase gradually. Moreover, we showed that 1) the altered function of GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors of EI can cause seizure, and 2) the pathway between the thalamic relay nucleus and EI facilitates the transition from interictal to the ictal activity by decreasing the preictal period. Thereafter, we considered both sensory and cortical periodic inputs to drive the model responses to various harmonic stimulations. Our results from the bifurcation analysis of the model suggest that the initial stage of the brain might be the main cause for the transition between interictal and ictal states as the stimulus frequency changes. The extended thalamocortical model shows also that the amplitude jump phenomenon and nonlinear resonance behavior result from the preictal stage of the brain. These results can be considered as a step forward to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transition from brain normal activities to epileptic activities.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The amplitude of fNIRS hemodynamic response in the visual cortex unmasks autistic traits in typically developing children</title>

	<description>Autistic traits represent a continuum dimension across the population, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) being the extreme end of the distribution. Accumulating evidence shows that neuroanatomical and neurofunctional profiles described in relatives of ASD individuals reflect an intermediate neurobiological pattern between the clinical population and healthy controls. This suggests that quantitative measures detecting autistic traits in the general population represent potential candidates for the development of biomarkers identifying early pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been extensively employed to investigate neural development and function. In contrast, the potential of fNIRS to define reliable biomarkers of brain activity has been barely explored. Features of non-invasiveness, portability, ease of administration and low-operating costs make fNIRS a suitable instrument to assess brain function for differential diagnosis, follow-up, analysis of treatment outcomes and personalized medicine in several neurological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel standardized procedure with high entertaining value to measure hemodynamic responses (HDR) in the occipital cortex of adult subjects and children. We found that the variability of evoked HDR correlates with the autistic traits of children, assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. Interestingly, HDR amplitude was especially linked to social and communication features, representing the core symptoms of ASD. These findings establish a quick and easy strategy for measuring visually-evoked cortical activity with fNIRS that optimize the compliance of young subjects, setting the background for testing the diagnostic value of fNIRS visual measurements in the ASD clinical population.</description>

	<description>Recent emphasis has been placed on gene transduction mediated through recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to manipulate activity of neurons and their circuitry in the primate brain. In the present study, we created a novel AAV vector of which capsid was composed of capsid proteins derived from the serotypes 1 and 2 (AAV1 and AAV2). Following the injection into the frontal cortex of macaque monkeys, this mosaic vector, termed AAV2.1 vector, was found to exhibit the excellence in transgene expression (for the AAV1 vector) and neuron specificity (for the AAV2 vector) simultaneously. To explore its applicability to chemogenetic manipulation and in vivo calcium imaging, the AAV2.1 vector expressing excitatory DREADDs or GCaMP was injected into the striatum or the visual cortex of macaque monkeys, respectively. Our results have defined that such vectors secure intense and stable expression of the target proteins and yield conspicuous modulation and imaging of neuronal activity.</description>

	<description>Neurons are believed to rely on dendritic localization and translation of mRNAs in order to generate activity-dependent changes in the synaptic plasticity. Here, we develop a strategy combining compartment-specific CLIP and TRAP in conditionally tagged mice to precisely define the ribosome bound dendritic transcriptome of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This revealed transcripts that have differentially localized alternative 3'UTR and splicing isoforms. FMRP targets are overrepresented among dendritic mRNAs, and compartment-specific FMRP-CLIP defined 383 dendritic FMRP targets, and also allowed for segregation of whole-cell FMRP targets into functional modules that are locally regulated by FMRP. In the absence of FMRP, dendritic FMRP targets show increased ribosome association, consistent with reported roles for FMRP in translational repression. Together, the data support a model in which distinct patterns of FMRP localization allow it to differentially regulate the expression of nuclear proteins and synaptic proteins within different compartments of a single neuronal cell type.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: EEG Biomarkers of reduced inhibition in human cortical microcircuits in depression</title>

	<description>Major depressive disorder (depression) is a complex condition that involves multiple physiological mechanisms, spanning a range of spatial scales. Altered cortical inhibition is associated with treatment-resistant depression, and reduced dendritic inhibition by somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons has been strongly implicated in this aspect of the pathology. However, whether the effects of reduced SST inhibition on microcircuit activity have signatures detectible in electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains unknown. We used detailed models of human cortical layer 2/3 microcircuits with normal or reduced SST inhibition to simulate resting-state activity together with EEG signals in health and depression. We first show that the healthy microcircuit models exhibit emergent key features of resting-state EEG. We then simulated EEG from depression microcircuits and found a significant power increase in theta, alpha and low beta frequencies (4 - 15 Hz). Following spectral decomposition, we show that the power increase involved a combination of aperiodic broadband component, and a periodic theta and low beta components. Neuronal spiking showed a spike preference for the phase preceding the EEG trough, which did not differ between conditions. Our study thus used detailed computational models to identify EEG biomarkers of reduced SST inhibition in human cortical microcircuits in depression, which may serve to improve the diagnosis and stratification of depression subtypes, and in monitoring the effects of pharmacological modulation of inhibition for treating depression.</description>

	<description>On-line classification of neural recordings can be extremely useful in brain-machine interface, prosthetic applications or therapeutic intervention. In this work we present a feasibility study for developing compact low-power VLSI systems able to classify neural recordings in real-time, using spike-based neuromorphic circuits. We developed a framework for classifying extra-cellular recordings made in rat auditory cortex in response to different auditory stimuli and porting the classification algorithm onto a spiking multi-neuron VLSI chip with programmable synaptic weights. We present recording methods and software classification algorithms; we demonstrate real-time classification in hardware and quantify the system performance; finally, we identify the potential sources of problems in developing such types of systems and propose strategies for overcoming them.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Common molecular mechanisms underlie the transfer of alpha-synuclein, Tau and huntingtin and modulate spontaneous activity in neuronal cells</title>

	<description>The misfolding and accumulation of disease-related proteins are common hallmarks among several neurodegenerative diseases. Alpha-synuclein (aSyn), Tau and huntingtin (wild-type and mutant, 25QHtt and 103QHtt, respectively) were recently shown to be transferred from cell-to-cell through different cellular pathways, thereby contributing to disease progression and neurodegeneration. However, the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms towards the spreading of these different proteins and the overall effect on neuronal function is still unclear. To address this, we exploited different cell-based systems to conduct a systematic comparison of the mechanisms of release of aSyn, Tau and Htt, and evaluated the effects of each protein upon internalization in microglial, astrocytic, and neuronal cells. In the models used, we demonstrate that 25QHtt, aSyn and Tau are released to the extracellular space at higher levels than 103QHtt, and their release can be further augmented with the co-expression of USP19. Furthermore, cortical neurons treated with recombinant monomeric 43QHtt exhibited alterations in neuronal activity that correlated with the toxicity of the polyglutamine expansion. Tau internalization resulted in an increase in neuronal activity, in contrast to slight effects observed with aSyn. Interestingly, all these disease-associated proteins were present at higher levels in ectosomes than in exosomes. The internalization of both types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by microglial or astrocytic cells elicited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoted an increase in autophagy markers. Additionally, the uptake of the EVs modulated neuronal activity in cortical neurons. Overall, our systematic study demonstrates the release of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins through similar cellular pathways. Furthermore, it emphasizes that protein release, both in a free form or in EVs, might contribute to a variety of detrimental effects in receiving cells and to progression of pathology, suggesting they may be exploited as valid targets for therapeutic intervention in different neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Gathering information is crucial for maximizing fitness, but requires diverting resources from searching directly for primary rewards to actively exploring the environment. Optimal decision-making thus maximizes information while reducing effort costs, but little is known about the neural implementation of these tradeoffs. We present a Reinforcement Meta-Learning (RML) computational mechanism that solves the trade-offs between the value and costs of gathering information. We implement the RML in a biologically plausible architecture that links catecholaminergic neuromodulators, the medial prefrontal cortex and topographically organized visual maps and show that it accounts for neural and behavioral findings on information demand motivated by instrumental incentives and intrinsic utility. Moreover, the utility function used by the RML, encoded by dopamine, is an approximation of free-energy. Thus, the RML presents a biologically plausible mechanism through which coordinated motivational, executive and sensory systems generate visual information gathering policies that minimize free energy.</description>

	<description>Neurons preferentially activated by learning have been ascribed the unique potential to encode memory. However, it remains unclear which genetically-defined cell types are recruited as part of such an ensemble, or what role discrete subpopulations play in behavior. Here we show that fear conditioning activates a heterogeneous neural ensemble in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), comprised to a large degree of GABAergic interneurons immunoreactive for somatostatin (SST-INs). Using an intersectional genetic approach, we demonstrate that fear learning-activated SST-INs exhibit distinct circuit properties, are preferentially reactivated during memory retrieval, and mediate the expression of defensive freezing. We further show that a rewarding experience, morphine treatment, activates an orthogonal SST-IN population that exerts opposing control over fear. These results outline an important role for discrete GABAergic ensembles in fear memory encoding, and point to an unappreciated capacity for functional specialization among SST-INs.</description>

	<description>Drosophila melanogaster is a candidate species to replace rodents in some neurobiological studies, encouraging attempts to develop behavioural tests for these flies. This study aimed to develop a behavioural test to simultaneously evaluate ethological (categorical) aspects of the motor and fluid intake activities, which may be used to assess sucrose preference in flies. For that, a lane-maze was 3D-printed to accommodate up to 14 individual flies in a single trial. Each lane had a capillary filled with 5% sucrose solution attached to one of the extremities. To validate a 5-min lane-maze test, male and female flies (adults, 5-6 days of age) underwent 0, 2, 8 or 20 h of food deprivation (FD, n=9-11/group) before testing. Duration of locomotion, immobility and grooming in the lane or capillary were scored from the video-recorded trials using EthoWatcher software. Minor effects of sex or FD were observed in the behaviours of flies. Independent of sex or FD, flies spent proportionally longer on the capillary than on the lane. Flies exhibited a significantly higher preference than expected for the capillary zone when food-deprived for 2h (males) or 20 h (females). Data suggest that short lane-maze test is a feasibly high throughput assessment of sucrose preference in flies, which may be sexually dimorphic as in other species studied so far.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Traces of semantization - from episodic to semantic memory in a spiking cortical network model</title>

	<description>Episodic memory is the recollection of past personal experiences associated with particular times and places. This kind of memory is commonly subject to loss of contextual information or &quot;semantization&quot;, which gradually decouples the encoded memory items from their associated contexts while transforming them into semantic or gist-like representations. Novel extensions to the classical Remember/Know behavioral paradigm attribute the loss of episodicity to multiple exposures of an item in different contexts. Despite recent advancements explaining semantization at a behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we suggest and evaluate a novel hypothesis proposing that Bayesian-Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms might cause semantization of episodic memory. We implement a cortical spiking neural network model with a Bayesian-Hebbian learning rule called Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), which captures the semantization phenomenon and offers a mechanistic explanation for it. Encoding items across multiple contexts leads to item-context decoupling akin to semantization. We compare BCPNN plasticity with the more commonly used spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule in the same episodic memory task. Unlike BCPNN, STDP does not explain the decontextualization process. We also examine how selective plasticity modulation of isolated salient events may enhance preferential retention and resistance to semantization. Our model reproduces important features of episodicity on behavioral timescales under various biological constraints whilst also offering a novel neural and synaptic explanation for semantization, thereby casting new light on the interplay between episodic and semantic memory processes.</description>

	<description>Huntington disease (HD), a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, manifests as progressively impaired movement and cognition. Although early abnormalities of neuronal activity in striatum are well established in HD models, there are fewer in vivo studies of the cortex. Here, we record local field potentials (LFPs) in YAC128 HD model mice versus wild-type mice. In multiple cortical areas, limb sensory stimulation evokes a greater change in LFP power in YAC128 mice. Mesoscopic imaging using voltage-sensitive dyes reveal more extensive spread of evoked sensory signals across the cortical surface in YAC128 mice. YAC128 layer 2/3 sensory cortical neurons ex vivo show increased excitatory events, which could contribute to enhanced sensory responses in vivo. Cortical LFP responses to limb stimulation, visual and auditory input are also significantly increased in zQ175 HD mice. Results presented here extend knowledge of HD beyond ex vivo studies of individual neurons to the intact cortical network.</description>

	<description>Neurons are highly polarized cells that display characteristic differences in the organization of their organelles in axons and dendrites. Mitochondria are of particular importance for neuronal homeostasis due to their high metabolic demand. The kinases SadA and SadB (SadA/B) promote the formation of distinct axonal and dendritic extensions during the development of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Here, we show that SadA/B are required for the axon-specific dynamics of mitochondria. The interaction with Ankyrin B (AnkB) stimulates the activity of SadA/B that function as regulators of mitochondrial dynamics through the phosphorylation of Tau. Suppression of SadA/B or AnkB in cortical neurons induces the elongation of mitochondria by disrupting the balance of fission and fusion. The normal dynamics of axonal mitochondria could be restored by mild actin destabilization. Thus, the elongation after a loss of SadA/B results from an excessive stabilization of actin filaments and reduction of Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria.</description>

	<description>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in regulating multiple behaviors and its dysfunction has been linked to many neural disorders. However, the molecular, cellular and anatomic heterogeneity underlying its functional diversity remains incompletely understood. Here, we generate a cell census of the mouse NAc using high-throughput single cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed error-robust FISH, revealing a high level of cell heterogeneity in this brain region. We show that the transcriptional and spatial diversity of neuron subtypes underlie NAc's anatomic and functional heterogeneity, and possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of different neurological disorders. These findings explain how the seemingly simple neuronal composition of the NAc achieves its highly heterogenous structure and diverse functions. Collectively, our study generates a spatially resolved cell taxonomy for understanding the NAc structure and function, which demonstrates the importance of combining molecular and spatial information in revealing the fundamental features of the nervous system.</description>

	<description>Most human auditory psychophysics research has been conducted with extreme 'auditory hygiene' in carefully controlled environments, with calibrated audio equipment, and potentially hours of repetitive testing with expert, well-characterized listeners. The incompatibility of web-based platforms with such experimental regimes would seem to preclude online auditory psychophysical paradigms, where success may hinge on absolute sound presentation level, reliably estimated perceptual thresholds, and sustained motivation, attention, and vigilance. Here, we introduce and validate a set of procedures that aim to address these challenges and facilitate successful online auditory psychophysics research. First, we establish a simple means of setting sound presentation levels where online participants serve as their own sound level meter. Across a set of three experiments conducted in person, we demonstrate the stability and robustness of this volume setting procedure both 'in the wild' and in controlled settings. Second, we test participants' tone-in-noise thresholds using widely adopted online experiment platforms, and demonstrate that reliable threshold estimates can be derived in approximately one minute of testing. Third, using these sound level setting and thresholding procedures to establish participant-specific stimulus conditions, we show that frequency-selective attention can be reliably demonstrated in individual participants with an online implementation of the classic, yet challenging, probe signal psychophysics paradigm. Finally, we show how threshold and attentional measures relate to well-validated assays of online participant fatigue, task confidence, and apathy acquired at multiple timepoints across the task. In all, this demonstrates the promise of asking new questions in auditory neuroscience with classic, yet challenging, online psychophysics paradigms. The code to duplicate our results is publicly available in JavaScript, through both Pavlovia (pavlovia.org) and Gorilla (gorilla.sc).</description>

	<description>While many people experience potentially threatening events during their life, only a minority develops posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The identification of individuals at risk among those exposed to trauma is crucial for PTSD prevention in the future. Since re-experiencing trauma elements outside of the original trauma-context is a core feature of PTSD, we investigate if the ability to bind memories to their original encoding context (i.e. memory contextualisation) predicts PTSD vulnerability. We hypothesize that pre-trauma neutral memory contextualization (under stress) negatively relates to PTSD-like behavior, in a prospective design using the cut-off behavioral criteria rat model for PTSD. 72 male Sprague Dawley rats were divided in two experimental groups to assess the predictive value of 1) memory contextualization without acute stress (NS-group) and 2) memory contextualization during the recovery phase of the acute stress-response (S-group) for susceptibility to PTSD-like behavior. A powerful extension to regression analysis -path analysis- was used to test this specific hypothesis, together with secondary research questions. Following traumatic predator scent stress, 19.4% of the rats displayed PTSD-like behavior. Results showed a negative relation between pre-trauma memory contextualization and PTSD-like behavior, but only in the NS-group. Pre-trauma memory contextualization was positively related to fear association in the trauma environment, again only in the NS group. If the predictive value of pre-trauma contextualization of neutral information under non-stressful conditions for PTSD susceptibility is replicated in prospective studies in humans, this factor would supplement already known vulnerability factors for PTSD and improve the identification of individuals at risk among the trauma exposed, especially those at high trauma risk such as soldiers deployed on a mission.</description>

	<description>The combination of optical tissue transparency with immunofluorescence allows the molecular characterization of biological tissues in 3D. However, adult human organs are particularly challenging to become transparent because of the autofluorescence contributions of aged tissues. To meet this challenge, we optimized SHORT (SWITCH - H2O2 - antigen Retrieval - TDE), a procedure based on standard histological treatments in combination with a refined clearing procedure to clear and label portions of the human brain. 3D histological characterization with multiple molecules is performed on cleared samples with a combination of multi-colors and multi-rounds labeling. By performing fast 3D imaging of the samples with a custom-made inverted light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM), we reveal fine details of intact human brain slabs at subcellular resolution. Overall, we proposed a scalable and versatile technology that in combination with LSFM allows mapping the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain, paving the way to reconstruct the entire organ.</description>

	<description>Three-dimensional brain cultures can facilitate the study of central nervous system function and disease, and one of the most important components that they present is neuronal activity on a network level. Here we demonstrate network activity in rodent cortical spheroids while maintaining the networks intact in their 3D state. Networks developed by nine days in culture and became more complex over time. To measure network activity, we imaged neurons in rat and mouse spheroids labelled with a calcium indicator dye, and in mouse spheroids expressing GCaMP. Network activity was evident when we electrically stimulated spheroids, was abolished with glutamatergic blockade, and was altered by GABAergic blockade or partial glutamatergic blockade. We quantified correlations and distances between somas with micron-scale spatial resolution. Spheroids seeded at as few as 4,000 cells gave rise to emergent network events, including oscillations. These results are the first demonstration that self-assembled rat and mouse spheroids exhibit network activity consistent with in vivo network events. These results open the door to experiments on neuronal networks that require fewer animals and enable high throughput experiments on network-perturbing alterations in neurons and glia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: APOE2, E3 and E4 differentially modulate cellular homeostasis, cholesterol metabolism and inflammatory response in isogenic iPSC-derived astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.17.452644v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the principal lipid carrier in the CNS and mainly expressed by astrocytes. The three different APOE alleles (E2, E3, and E4) impose differential risk to Alzheimers disease (AD); E2 is protective, E3 is defined as average risk, while E4 is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. Despite recent advances, the fundamental role of different APOE alleles in brain homeostasis is still poorly understood. To uncover the functional role of APOE in human astrocytes, we differentiated human APOE-isogenic iPSCs (E4, E3, E2 and APOE-knockout (KO)) to functional astrocytes (hereafter: iAstrocytes), with a resting, non-proliferating phenotype. Functional assays indicated that polymorphisms in APOE (APOE4&amp;gt;E3&amp;gt;E2=KO) reduced iAstrocyte metabolic and clearance functions including glutamate uptake and receptor-mediated uptake of {beta}-amyloid aggregates. We performed unlabelled mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of iAstrocytes at baseline and after activation with interleukin-1{beta} showing a reduction of cholesterol and lipid metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, and an increase of immunoregulatory pathways at baseline (E4&amp;gt;E3&amp;gt;E2). Cholesterol efflux and biosynthesis were reduced in E4 iAstrocytes, and subcellular localization of cholesterol in lysosomes was increased. In APOE-KO iAstrocytes, APOE-independent mechanisms showed to be proficient in mediating cholesterol biosynthesis and efflux. Proteomic analysis of IL-1{beta}-treated iAstrocytes showed an increase of cholesterol/lipid metabolism and biosynthesis as well as inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, cholesterol efflux, which was reduced in APOE4 iAstrocytes at baseline, was alleviated in activated E4 iAstrocytes. Inflammatory cytokine release was exacerbated upon IL-1{beta} treatment in E4 iAstrocytes (E4&amp;gt;E3&amp;gt;E2&amp;gt;KO), in line with the proteomic data. Taken together, we show that APOE plays a major role in several physiological and metabolic processes in human astrocytes with APOE4 pushing iAstrocytes to a disease-relevant phenotype, causing dysregulated cholesterol/lipid homeostasis, increased inflammatory signalling and reduced {beta}-amyloid uptake while APOE2 iAstrocytes show opposing effects. Our study provides a new reference for AD-relevant proteomic and metabolic changes, mediated by the three main APOE isoforms in human astrocytes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Chloride oscillation in pacemaker neurons regulates circadian rhythms through a chloride-sensing WNK kinase signaling cascade</title>

	<description>Central pacemaker neurons regulate circadian rhythms and undergo diurnal variation in electrical activity in mammals and flies. In mammals, circadian variation in the intracellular chloride concentration of pacemaker neurons has been proposed to influence the response to GABAergic neurotransmission through GABAA receptor chloride channels. However, results have been contradictory, and a recent study demonstrated circadian variation in pacemaker neuron chloride without an effect on GABA response. Therefore, whether and how intracellular chloride regulates circadian rhythms remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate a signaling role for intracellular chloride in the Drosophila ventral lateral (LNv) pacemaker neurons. In control flies, intracellular chloride increases in LNv neurons over the course of the morning. Chloride transport through the sodium-potassium-2-chloride (NKCC) and potassium-chloride (KCC) cotransporters is a major determinant of intracellular chloride concentrations. Drosophila melanogaster with loss-of-function mutations in the NKCC encoded by Ncc69 have abnormally low intracellular chloride six hours after lights on, and a lengthened circadian period. Loss of kcc, which is expected to increase intracellular chloride, suppresses the long-period phenotype of Ncc69 mutant flies. Activation of a chloride-inhibited kinase cascade, consisting of the WNK (With No Lysine (K)) kinase and its downstream substrate, Fray, is necessary and sufficient to prolong period length. Fray activation of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Irk1, is also required for the long-period phenotype. These results indicate that the NKCC-dependent rise in intracellular chloride in Drosophila LNv pacemaker neurons restrains WNK-Fray signaling and overactivation of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel to maintain normal circadian period length.</description>

	<description>The enteric nervous system (ENS) populates the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and controls GI function. In contrast to the central nervous system, macrostructure of the ENS has been largely overlooked. Here, we visually and computationally demonstrate that the ENS is organized in circumferential stripes that regionally differ in development and neuronal composition. This characterization provides a blueprint for future understanding of region-specific GI function and identifying ENS structural correlates of GI disorders.</description>

	<description>Lateralization is a hallmark of somatosensory processing in the mammalian brain. However, in addition to their contralateral representation, unilateral tactile stimuli also modulate neuronal activity in somatosensory cortices of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The cellular organization and functional role of these ipsilateral stimulus responses in awake somatosensory cortices, especially regarding stimulus coding, are unknown. Here, we targeted silicon probe recordings to the vibrissa region of primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed male and female mice while delivering ipsilateral and contralateral whisker stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli drove larger and more reliable responses in S2 than in S1, and activated a larger fraction of stimulus-responsive neurons. Ipsilateral stimulus-responsive neurons were rare in layer 4 of S1, but were located in equal proportion across all layers in S2. Linear classifier analyses further revealed that decoding of the ipsilateral stimulus was more accurate in S2 than S1, while S1 decoded contralateral stimuli most accurately. These results reveal substantial encoding of ipsilateral stimuli in S1 and especially S2, consistent with the hypothesis that higher cortical areas may integrate tactile inputs across larger portions of space, spanning both sides of the body.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Radical pairs can explain magnetic field and lithium effects on the circadian clock</title>

	<description>Drosophila's circadian clock can be perturbed by magnetic fields, as well as by lithium administration. Cryptochromes are critical for the circadian clock. Further, the radical pairs in cryptochrome also can explain magnetoreception in animals. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model of the animal magnetic compass, we show that both magnetic fields and lithium can influence the spin dynamics of the naturally occurring radical pairs and hence modulate the circadian clock's rhythms. Using a simple chemical oscillator model for the circadian clock, we show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the chemical oscillator model, which translates into a change in the circadian period. Our model can reproduce the results of two independent experiments, magnetic fields and lithium effects on the circadian clock. Our model predicts that stronger magnetic fields would shorten the clock's period. We also predict that lithium influences the clock in an isotope-dependent manner. Furthermore, our model also predicts that magnetic fields and hyperfine interactions modulate oxidative stress. The findings of this work suggest that quantum nature and entanglement of radical pairs might play roles in the brain, as another piece of evidence in addition to recent results on xenon anesthesia and lithium effects on hyperactivity.</description>

	<description>Selectivity for direction of motion is a key feature of primary visual cortical neurons. Visual experience is required for direction selectivity in carnivore and primate visual cortex, but the circuit mechanisms of its formation remain incompletely understood. Here we examined how developing lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons may contribute to cortical direction selectivity. Using in vivo electrophysiology techniques, we examined LGN receptive field properties of visually naive female ferrets before and after exposure to 6 hours of motion stimuli in order to assess the effect of acute visual experience on LGN cell development. We found that acute experience with motion stimuli did not significantly affect the weak orientation or direction selectivity of LGN neurons. In addition, we found that neither latency nor sustainedness or transience of LGN neurons significantly changed with acute experience. These results suggest that the direction selectivity that emerges in cortex after acute experience is computed in cortex and cannot be explained by changes in LGN cells.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Spatio-temporal dynamics of stress-induced network reconfigurations reflect negative affectivity</title>

	<description>Background: Chronic stress is an important risk factor in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders, but exact pathomechanisms remain to be understood. Mapping individual differences of acute stress-induced neurophysiological changes, especially on the level of neural activation and functional connectivity (FC), could provide important insights in how variation in the individual stress response is linked to disease risk. Methods: Using an established psycho-social stress task flanked by two resting-state scans, we measured subjective, physiological, and brain responses to acute stress and recovery in 217 unmedicated participants with and without mood and anxiety disorders. To estimate block-wise changes in stress-induced brain activation and FC, we used hierarchical mixed-effects models based on denoised timeseries within a predefined stress network. We predicted inter- and intra-individual differences in stress phases (anticipation vs. acute stress vs. recovery) and transdiagnostic dimensions of stress reactivity using elastic net and support vector machines. Results: We identified four subnetworks showing distinct changes in FC over time. Subnetwork trajectories predicted the stress phase (accuracy: 71%, pperm&amp;lt;.001) and increases in pulse rate (R2 =.10, pperm&amp;lt;.001). Critically, individual spatio-temporal trajectories of changes across networks also predicted negative affectivity ({Delta}R2=.08, pperm=.009), but not the presence or absence of a mood and anxiety disorder. Conclusions: Spatio-temporal dynamics of brain network reconfiguration induced by stress reflect individual differences in the psychopathology dimension negative affectivity. These results support the idea that vulnerability for mood and anxiety disorders can be conceptualized best at the level of network dynamics, which may pave the way for improved prediction of individual risk.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeted tDCS Mitigates Dual‐Task Costs to Gait and Balance in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26156</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26156?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Among older adults, the ability to stand or walk while performing cognitive tasks (ie, dual‐tasking) requires coordinated activation of several brain networks. In this multicenter, double‐blinded, randomized, and sham‐controlled study, we examined the effects of modulating the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L‐DLPFC) and the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on dual‐task performance “costs” to standing and walking.


Methods
Fifty‐seven older adults without overt illness or disease completed 4 separate study visits during which they received 20 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized to facilitate the excitability of the L‐DLPFC and SM1 simultaneously, or each region separately, or neither region (sham). Before and immediately after stimulation, participants completed a dual‐task paradigm in which they were asked to stand and walk with and without concurrent performance of a serial‐subtraction task.


Results
tDCS simultaneously targeting the L‐DLPFC and SM1, as well as tDCS targeting the L‐DLPFC alone, mitigated dual‐task costs to standing and walking to a greater extent than tDCS targeting SM1 alone or sham (p &amp;lt; 0.02). Blinding efficacy was excellent and participant subjective belief in the type of stimulation received (real or sham) did not contribute to the observed functional benefits of tDCS.


Interpretation
These results demonstrate that in older adults, dual‐task decrements may be amenable to change and implicate L‐DPFC excitability as a modifiable component of the control system that enables dual‐task standing and walking. tDCS may be used to improve resilience and the ability of older results to walk and stand under challenging conditions, potentially enhancing everyday functioning and reducing fall risks.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeting Inflammasomes to Treat Neurological Diseases</title>

	<description>Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that can sense a plethora of microbe‐ and damage‐associated molecular signals. They play important roles in innate immunity and are key regulators of inflammation in health and disease. Inflammasome‐mediated processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1β and IL‐18 and induction of pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death, have been associated with the development and progression of common immune‐mediated and degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing number of pharmacological compounds inhibiting inflammasome activation and signaling show therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of the aforementioned disease conditions. Here, we illustrate regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation during CNS homeostasis and tissue injury. We highlight the evidence for inflammasome activation as a mechanistic underpinning in a wide range of CNS diseases and critically discuss the promise and potential limitations of therapeutic strategies that aim to inhibit the inflammasome components in neurological disorders.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CircRNAs belong to a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are generated by exons of genes by alternative mRNA splicing and involved in pathophysiological processes of ischemic stroke by regulating neuro-inflammation. A total of 982 patients were enrolled in our study for stroke recovery analysis. The aim of our study was to first explore the association between the inflammation-related circRNA polymorphism and functional outcome 3 months after ischemic stroke by using multivariate logistic regression model. Next, we further investigated the role of circRNA polymorphism in predicting stroke recurrence by using Cox proportional hazard regression model. Five circRNA polymorphisms were genotyped by using polymerase chain reaction and ligation detection reaction method. We identified circ-STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) rs2293152 GG genotype to be associated with poorer recovery 90 days after stroke (OR = 1.452, 95% CI: 1.165–4.362, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016). After adjusting for confound factors, the association for rs2293152 with 3 months outcome after IS was stronger, suggesting a mechanism that rs2293152 is an independent risk factor for stroke recovery (OR = 2.255, 95% CI: 1.034–2.038, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.031). However, no other circRNA polymorphisms (circ-DLGAP4 rs41274714, circ-TRAF2 rs10870141, circ-ITCH rs10485505, rs4911154) were associated with functional outcome 3 months after stroke in any genetic models. Subgroup analysis revealed that the negative effect of rs2293152 GG genotype was greater in female and older patients, subjects with history of hypertension. Additionally, all the circRNA polymorphisms were not correlated with recurrent risk of ischemic stroke. Our results indicated that circ-STAT3 might be a novel biomarker for predicting functional outcome after stroke and an important contributor to the ischemic stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;How does your brain decide what you will do next? Over the past few decades compelling evidence has emerged that the basal ganglia, a collection of nuclei in the fore- and mid-brain of all vertebrates, are vital to action selection. Gurney, Prescott, and Redgrave published an influential computational account of this idea in Biological Cybernetics in 2001. Here we take a look back at this pair of papers, outlining the “GPR” model contained therein, the context of that model’s development, and the influence it has had over the past twenty years. Tracing its lineage into models and theories still emerging now, we are encouraged that the GPR model is that rare thing, a computational model of a brain circuit whose advances were directly built on by others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Soon after hatching, the young of precocial species, such as domestic chicks or ducklings, learn to recognize their social partner by simply being exposed to it (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;imprinting&lt;/em&gt; process). Even artificial objects or stimuli displayed on monitor screens can effectively trigger filial imprinting, though learning is canalized by spontaneous preferences for animacy signals, such as certain kinds of motion or a face-like appearance. Imprinting is used as a behavioural paradigm for studies on memory formation, early learning and predispositions, as well as number and space cognition, and brain asymmetries. Here, we present an automatized setup to expose and/or test animals for a variety of imprinting experiments. The setup consists of a cage with two high-frequency screens at the opposite ends where stimuli are shown. Provided with a camera covering the whole space of the cage, the behaviour of the animal is recorded continuously. A graphic user interface implemented in Matlab allows a custom configuration of the experimental protocol, that together with Psychtoolbox drives the presentation of images on the screens, with accurate time scheduling and a highly precise framerate. The setup can be implemented into a complete workflow to analyse behaviour in a fully automatized way by combining Matlab (and Psychtoolbox) to control the monitor screens and stimuli, DeepLabCut to track animals’ behaviour, Python (and R) to extract data and perform statistical analyses. The automated setup allows neuro-behavioural scientists to perform standardized protocols during their experiments, with faster data collection and analyses, and reproducible results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;While the unique hunting behavior of archerfish has received considerable scientific attention, the specific social cues that govern behaviors like intraspecific kleptoparasitism in the species are less understood. This paper asks whether the use of a robotic facsimile representing an archerfish can elicit a social response if it approximates an archerfish’s appearance, along with key features of its hunting behavior. We found that the fish respond to the robot when it hunted, as indicated by decreasing distances between the robot and fish (and among the fish) during the robot’s hunting behavior sequence, as well as higher net transfer entropy when the robot was hunting. These effects were present even when the robot’s “hunt” was unproductive and did not result in food. The temporal pattern of fish approach to the robot and each other indicated that the segment of robot hunting behavior proximal to the robotic facsimile shot elicited fish behavior initially. However, earlier cues in the robot’s hunting sequence became important following more experience with a food contingency. This indicates that further studies could use a robotic facsimile to conduct a detailed stimulus analysis, changing aspects of the robot’s appearance and behavior to uncover the basic mechanisms of information transfer among individuals in a social hunting scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: TREM2 impacts brain microglia, oligodendrocytes and endothelial co-expression modules revealing genes and pathways important in Alzheimer s disease</title>

	<description>A microglia response to pathogenic signals in diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) has long been recognised, but recent genetic findings have cemented their direct causal contribution to AD and thus the potential to target them or their effector pathways as a possible treatment strategy. TREM2 is a highly penetrant microglia risk gene for AD, which appears central to the coordination of the damage response by microglia in AD. Its absence has a negative impact on Tau and amyloid symptoms and pathologies. Full knowledge of its pathway and relationships with other brain cells in AD has not been fully characterised, but will be essential to fully evaluate the impact of manipulating this pathway for treatment development and to establish the best targets for achieving this. We used whole genome RNA sequencing of hippocampus and cortical brain samples from control, AD, and AD TREM2 risk carriers to identify TREM2-dependent genes driving changes in pathways, processes and cell types in AD. Through highly influential intra and intermodular hub genes and overall changes in the levels of gene expression, TREM2-DAP12 was found to strongly influence a number of other microglia, oligodendrocyte and endothelial genes, notably those involved in complement and Fc{gamma} receptor function, microglia-associated ribosomal genes and oligodendrocyte genes, particularly proteosomal subunits. These strong TREM2 centred co-expression relationships were significantly disrupted in AD cases with a TREM2 risk variant, revealing for the first time genes and pathways directly impacted by TREM2 in the brains of AD patients. Consistent with its function as a lipid sensor, our data supports a role for TREM2 in mediating oligodendrocyte and/or myelin clearance in AD which may be essential not only for preserving healthy tissue homeostasis but may also serve to minimise the persistence of antigenic peptides and lipids which may lead to detrimental pro-inflammatory sequelae. Further work should expand our knowledge of TREM2 on complement and Fc{gamma} receptor function and its impact on oligodendcrotye and myelin integrity and further evaluate the genes and pathways we have identified as possible treatment targets for AD.</description>

	<description>Vocalizations, like many social displays, are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors that are modulated by a complex combination of cues. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alstons singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), for example, each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguous for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally co-label neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong co-labeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive co-labeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. Although we observe some novel patterns of double-labelling, the progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.</description>

Reward prediction errors (RPEs) and risk preferences have two things in common: both can shape decision making behavior, and both are commonly associated with dopamine. RPEs drive value learning and are thought to be represented in the phasic release of striatal dopamine. Risk preferences bias choices towards or away from uncertainty; they can be manipulated with drugs that target the dopaminergic system. Based on the common neural substrate, we hypothesize that RPEs and risk preferences are linked on the level of behavior as well. Here, we develop this hypothesis theoretically and test it empirically. First, we apply a recent theory of learning in the basal ganglia to predict how RPEs influence risk preferences. We find that positive RPEs should cause increased risk-seeking, while negative RPEs should cause risk-aversion. We then test our behavioral predictions using a novel bandit task in which value and risk vary independently across options. Critically, conditions are included where options vary in risk but are matched for value. We find that our prediction was correct: participants become more risk-seeking if choices are preceded by positive RPEs, and more risk-averse if choices are preceded by negative RPEs. These findings cannot be explained by other known effects, such as nonlinear utility curves or dynamic learning rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ryRvhlwNm14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Knowledge of genes that are critical to a tissue’s function remains difficult to ascertain and presents a major bottleneck toward a mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype links. Here, we present the first machine learning model–FUGUE–combining transcriptional and network features, to predict tissue-relevant genes across 30 human tissues. FUGUE achieves an average cross-validation auROC of 0.86 and auPRC of 0.50 (expected 0.09). In independent datasets, FUGUE accurately distinguishes tissue or cell type-specific genes, significantly outperforming the conventional metric based on tissue-specific expression alone. Comparison of tissue-relevant transcription factors across tissue recapitulate their developmental relationships. Interestingly, the tissue-relevant genes cluster on the genome within topologically associated domains and furthermore, are highly enriched for differentially expressed genes in the corresponding cancer type. We provide the prioritized gene lists in 30 human tissues and an open-source software to prioritize genes in a novel context given multi-sample transcriptomic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q0Vq1zoQvX4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Within the computational neuroscience community, there has been a focus on simulating the electrical activity of neurons, while other components of brain tissue, such as glia cells and the extracellular space, are often neglected. Standard models of extracellular potentials are based on a combination of multicompartmental models describing neural electrodynamics and volume conductor theory. Such models cannot be used to simulate the slow components of extracellular potentials, which depend on ion concentration dynamics, and the effect that this has on extracellular diffusion potentials and glial buffering currents. We here present the electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia (edNEG) model, which we believe is the first model to combine compartmental neuron modeling with an electrodiffusive framework for intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics in a local piece of neuro-glial brain tissue. The edNEG model (i) keeps track of all intraneuronal, intraglial, and extracellular ion concentrations and electrical potentials, (ii) accounts for action potentials and dendritic calcium spikes in neurons, (iii) contains a neuronal and glial homeostatic machinery that gives physiologically realistic ion concentration dynamics, (iv) accounts for electrodiffusive transmembrane, intracellular, and extracellular ionic movements, and (v) accounts for glial and neuronal swelling caused by osmotic transmembrane pressure gradients. The edNEG model accounts for the concentration-dependent effects on ECS potentials that the standard models neglect. Using the edNEG model, we analyze these effects by splitting the extracellular potential into three components: one due to neural sink/source configurations, one due to glial sink/source configurations, and one due to extracellular diffusive currents. Through a series of simulations, we analyze the roles played by the various components and how they interact in generating the total slow potential. We conclude that the three components are of comparable magnitude and that the stimulus conditions determine which of the components that dominate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qd30fYcDUCM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is the most common type of autoimmune encephalitis (AIE). Subacute memory disturbance, temporal lobe seizures, and psychiatric symptoms are clinical hallmarks of the disease. However, little is known on the factors contributing to cognitive functioning in ALE. Hence, we here investigate major determinants of cognitive functioning in ALE. In a retrospective analysis of 102 patients with ALE, we first compared verbal learning capacity, nonverbal learning capacity, and attentional and executive functioning by absence or presence of different types of neural autoantibodies (AABs). Subsequently we established three linear regression models including 63, 38, and 61 patients, respectively to investigate how cognitive functioning in these domains may depend on common markers of ALE such as intrathecal inflammation, blood‐cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐barrier function, mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges and slowing, determined by electroencephalography (EEG) and structural mesiotemporal changes, measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also accounted for possible effects of cancer‐ and immunotherapy and other centrally effective medication. There was no effect of AAB status on cognitive functioning. Although the regression models could not predict verbal and nonverbal learning capacity, structural mesiotemporal neural network alterations on T2‐/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)‐signal‐weighted MRI and mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges or slowing on EEG exerted a significant impact on memory functions. In contrast, the regression model significantly predicted attentional and executive functioning with CSF white blood cell count and centrally effective medication being significant determinants. In this cohort, cognitive functioning in ALE does not depend on the AAB status. Common markers of ALE cannot predict memory functioning that only partially depends on structural and functional alterations of mesiotemporal neural networks. Common markers of ALE significantly predict attentional and executive functioning that is significantly related to centrally effective medication and CSF white blood cell count, which may point toward inflammation affecting brain regions beyond the limbic system.</description>

	<description>Compared with healthy controls, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy patients with a shorter duration of disease showed differences in static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC). Compared with sFNC, dFNC analysis showed more and inconsistent inter‐network functional connectivity abnormalities. At the same time, the variability of inter‐network dFNC is correlated with orienting function.

Abstract
The brain network alterations associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate altered patterns of static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC) in TLE with different durations of disease. In this study, 19 TLE patients with a disease duration of ≤5 years (TLE‐SD), 24 TLE patients with a disease duration of &amp;gt;5 years (TLE‐LD), and 21 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging and attention network test. We used group independent component analysis to determine the target resting‐state networks. Sliding window correlation and k‐means clustering analysis methods were used to obtain different dFNC states, temporal properties, and temporal variability. We then compared sFNC and dFNC between groups and found that compared with HCs, TLE‐SD patients had increased sFNC between the dorsal attention network and sensorimotor network/visual network (VN), but decreased sFNC between the inferior–posterior default mode network and VN. In the strongly connected dFNC state, TLE‐SD patients spent more time, had greater mean dwell time, and showed greater inconsistent abnormal network connectivity. There was a significant negative correlation between the temporal variability of auditory network‐ left fronto‐parietal network connectivity and orienting effect. No significant differences in sFNC and dFNC were detected between TLE‐LD and HC groups. These findings suggest that the damage and functional brain network abnormalities gradually occur in TLE patients after the onset of epilepsy, which might lead to functional network reorganization and compensatory remodeling as the disease progresses.</description>

	<description>The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is functionally subdivided into somatotopic subregions that represent each body part and play crucial roles in sensorimotor functions. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule gene Cdh20, which encodes a Type II cadherin, is expressed in discrete subregions covering the inner orofacial area and a part of the forelimb area in the ventral domain of the DLS in rats.







Abstract
The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rodents is functionally subdivided into somatotopic subregions that represent each body part along both the dorsoventral and anteroposterior (A‐P) axes and play crucial roles in sensorimotor functions via corticostriatal pathways. However, little is known about the spatial gene expression patterns and heterogeneity of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) within somatotopic subregions. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule gene Cdh20, which encodes a Type II cadherin, is expressed in discrete subregions covering the inner orofacial area and part of the forelimb area in the ventral domain of the DLS (v‐DLS) in rats. Cdh20‐expressing cells were localized in the v‐DLS at the intermediate level of the striatum along the A‐P axis and could be classified as direct‐pathway SPNs or indirect‐pathway SPNs. Unexpectedly, comprehensive analysis revealed that Cdh20 is expressed in SPNs in the rat DLS but not in the mouse DLS or the ferret putamen (Pu). Our observations reveal that Cdh20 expression demarcates somatotopic subregions and subpopulations of SPNs specifically in the rat DLS and suggest divergent regulation of genes differentially expressed in the v‐DLS and Pu among mammals.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ephrin‐A3 is required for tonotopic map precision and auditory functions in the mouse auditory brainstem</title>

	<description>We investigated the molecular basis of tonotopic map formation in the mouse auditory brainstem. We found that the axon guidance cue ephrin‐A3 is differentially expressed along the tonotopic map in the mouse auditory brainstem. Ephrin‐A3 is sufficient to repel growing auditory nerve fibers in vitro. In mice lacking ephrin‐A3, the tonotopic map is degraded in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, and auditory activation patterns and the ability to discriminate sound frequency changes are also impaired.







Abstract
Tonotopy is a prominent feature of the vertebrate auditory system and forms the basis for sound discrimination, but the molecular mechanism that underlies its formation remains largely elusive. Ephrin/Eph signaling is known to play important roles in axon guidance during topographic mapping in other sensory systems, so we investigated its possible role in the establishment of tonotopy in the mouse cochlear nucleus. We found that ephrin‐A3 molecules are differentially expressed along the tonotopic axis in the cochlear nucleus during innervation. Ephrin‐A3 forward signaling is sufficient to repel auditory nerve fibers in a developmental stage‐dependent manner. In mice lacking ephrin‐A3, the tonotopic map is degraded and isofrequency bands of neuronal activation upon pure tone exposure become imprecise in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Ephrin‐A3 mutant mice also exhibit a delayed second wave in auditory brainstem responses upon sound stimuli and impaired detection of sound frequency changes. Our findings establish an essential role for ephrin‐A3 in forming precise tonotopy in the auditory brainstem to ensure accurate sound discrimination.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Characterization of Tbr2‐expressing retinal ganglion cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25208</guid>

	<description>Using genetic sparse labeling and recording on a newly engineered T‐brain 2 (Tbr2)CreERT2 mouse line paired with various reporter lines, we identified seven types of Tbr2‐expressing retina ganglion cells, including M1–M6 types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and a Pou4f1+ RGC with bushy and small dendritic arbors stratifying into the OFF sublaminae (in red). Additionally, we identified three types of Tbr2‐expressing amacrine cells, including two widefield and a mediumfield displaced amacrine cell (AC) types, all with dendritic arbors stratifying into the ON sublaminae (in black). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Tbr2 is essential for the survival of these RGCs and displaced ACs, as well as maintaining the expression of Opn4.







Abstract
The mammalian retina contains more than 40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes based on their unique morphologies, functions, and molecular profiles. Among them, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) are the first specified RGC type emerging from a common retinal progenitor pool during development. Previous work has shown that T‐box transcription factor T‐brain 2 (Tbr2) is essential for the formation and maintenance of ipRGCs, and that Tbr2‐expressing RGCs activate Opn4 expression upon native ipRGC ablation, suggesting that Tbr2+ RGCs contain a reservoir for ipRGCs. However, the identity of Tbr2+ RGCs has not been fully vetted. Here, using genetic sparse labeling and single cell recording, we showed that Tbr2‐expressing retinal neurons include RGCs and a subset of GABAergic displaced amacrine cells (dACs). Most Tbr2+ RGCs are intrinsically photosensitive and morphologically resemble native ipRGCs with identical retinofugal projections. Tbr2+ RGCs also include a unique and rare Pou4f1‐expressing OFF RGC subtype. Using a loss‐of‐function strategy, we have further demonstrated that Tbr2 is essential for the survival of these RGCs and dACs, as well as maintaining the expression of Opn4. These data set a strong foundation to study how Tbr2 regulates ipRGC development and survival, as well as the expression of molecular machinery regulating intrinsic photosensitivity.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Axonal injury alters the extracellular glial environment of the axon initial segment and allows substantial mitochondrial influx into axon initial segment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25212</guid>

	<description>Our present focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy analysis demonstrates marked mitochondrial influx into the axon initial segment (AIS) in response to axonal injury. In the healthy (control) AIS, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. On the other hand, after injury, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS (scale bar 5 μm).







Abstract
The axon initial segment (AIS) is structurally and functionally distinct from other regions of the axon, yet alterations in the milieu of the AIS after brain injury have not been well characterized. In this study, we have examined extracellular and intracellular changes in the AIS after hypoglossal nerve injury. Microglial adhesions to the AIS were rarely observed in healthy controls, whereas microglial adhesions to the AIS became apparent in the axonal injury model. Regarding intra‐AIS morphology, we focused on mitochondria because mitochondrial flow into the injured axon appears critical for axonal regeneration. To visualize mitochondria specifically in injured axons, we used Atf3:BAC transgenic mice whose mitochondria were labeled with GFP in response to nerve injury. These mice clearly showed mitochondrial localization in the AIS after nerve injury. To precisely confirm the light microscopic observations, we performed three‐dimensional ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Although the healthy AIS was not surrounded by microglia, tight microglial adhesions with thick processes adhering to the AIS were observed after injury. FIB/SEM simultaneously allowed the observation of mitochondrial localization in the AIS. In the AIS of non‐injured neurons, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. Intriguingly, in the injured AIS, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS. Taken together, axonal injury changes the extracellular glial environment surrounding the AIS and intracellular mitochondrial localization in the AIS. These changes would be crucial responses, perhaps for injured neurons to regenerate after axonal injury.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut Microbiome Signatures of Risk and Prodromal Markers of Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26128</guid>

	<description>Objective
Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.


Methods
Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function, and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α‐/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND (Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study participants.


Results
Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Among other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes‐enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the Bacteroides‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the Prevotella‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history, and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.


Interpretation
Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non–Cell Autonomous Epileptogenesis in Focal Cortical Dysplasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26149</guid>

	<description>Objective
Low‐level somatic mosaicism in the brain has been shown to be a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy. However, how a relatively few mutation‐carrying neurons are able to induce epileptogenesis at the local network level remains poorly understood.


Methods
To probe the origin of epileptogenesis, we measured the excitability of neurons with MTOR mutation and nearby nonmutated neurons recorded by whole‐cell patch‐clamp and array‐based electrodes comparing the topographic distribution of mutation. Computational simulation is used to understand neural network‐level changes based on electrophysiological properties. To examine the underlying mechanism, we measured inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in mutated neurons and nearby neurons by electrophysiological and histological methods using the mouse model and postoperative human brain tissue for cortical dysplasia. To explain non–cell‐autonomous hyperexcitability, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase was injected into mice to enhance adenosine signaling and to mitigate hyperactivity of nearby nonmutated neurons.


Results
We generated mice with a low‐level somatic mutation in MTOR presenting spontaneous seizures. The seizure‐triggering hyperexcitability originated from nonmutated neurons near mutation‐carrying neurons, which proved to be less excitable than nonmutated neurons. Interestingly, the net balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mutated neurons remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that inhibition of adenosine kinase, which affects adenosine metabolism and neuronal excitability, reduced the hyperexcitability of nonmutated neurons.


Interpretation
This study shows that neurons carrying somatic mutations in MTOR lead to focal epileptogenesis via non–cell‐autonomous hyperexcitability of nearby nonmutated neurons. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Organization and neural connections of the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25209</guid>

	<description>Single cell tracer injections suggest that the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust integrates sensory signals with internal compass information to drive descending and premotor neurons that are likely involved in steering of the animal during locomotion. Overlap of inputs and outputs of the central complex in the gall and ovoid body of the lateral complex suggest feedback loops in the sky compass system.







Abstract
The lateral complexes (LXs) are bilaterally paired neuropils in the insect brain that mediate communication between the central complex (CX), a brain center controlling spatial orientation, various sensory processing areas, and thoracic motor centers that execute locomotion. The LX of the desert locust consists of the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), and the medial and lateral bulb. We have analyzed the anatomical organization and the neuronal connections of the LX in the locust, to provide a basis for future functional studies. Reanalyzing the morphology of neurons connecting the CX and the LX revealed likely feedback loops in the sky compass network of the CX via connections in the gall of the LAL and a newly identified neuropil termed ovoid body. In addition, we characterized 16 different types of neuron that connect the LAL with other areas in the brain. Eight types of neuron provide information flow between both LALs, five types are LAL input neurons, and three types are LAL output neurons. Among these are neurons providing input from sensory brain areas such as the lobula and antennal neuropils. Brain regions most often targeted by LAL neurons are the posterior slope, the wedge, and the crepine. Two descending neurons with dendrites in the LAL were identified. Our data support and complement existing knowledge about how the LAL is embedded in the neuronal network involved in processing of sensory information and generation of appropriate behavioral output for goal‐directed locomotion.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum is increasingly attracting scientists interested in basic and clinical research of neuromodulation. Here, we review available studies that used either transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to examine the role of the posterior cerebellum in different aspects of social and affective cognition, from mood regulation to emotion discrimination, and from the ability to identify biological motion to higher-level social inferences (mentalizing). We discuss how at the functional level the role of the posterior cerebellum in these different processes may be explained by a generic prediction mechanism and how the posterior cerebellum may exert this function within different cortico-cerebellar and cerebellar limbic networks involved in social cognition. Furthermore, we suggest to deepen our understanding of the cerebro-cerebellar circuits involved in different aspects of social cognition by employing promising stimulation approaches that have so far been primarily used to study cortical functions and networks, such as paired-pulse TMS, frequency-tuned stimulation, state-dependent protocols, and chronometric TMS. The ability to modulate cerebro-cerebellar connectivity opens up possible clinical applications for improving impairments in social and affective skills associated with cerebellar abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene expression and translation have been extensively studied in human post-mortem brain tissue from subjects with psychiatric disease. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) have received less attention despite their implication by unbiased genetic studies and importance in regulating neuronal and circuit function. Here we review the rationale for studying PTMs in psychiatric disease, recent findings in human post-mortem tissue, the required controls for these types of studies, and highlight the emerging mass spectrometry approaches transforming this research direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Super-Selective Reconstruction of Causal and Direct Connectivity With Application to in vitro iPSC Neuronal Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite advancements in the development of cell-based in-vitro neuronal network models, the lack of appropriate computational tools limits their analyses. Methods aimed at deciphering the effective connections between neurons from extracellular spike recordings would increase utility of in vitro local neural circuits, especially for studies of human neural development and disease based on induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Current techniques allow statistical inference of functional couplings in the network but are fundamentally unable to correctly identify indirect and apparent connections between neurons, generating redundant maps with limited ability to model the causal dynamics of the network. In this paper, we describe a novel mathematically rigorous, model-free method to map effective—direct and causal—connectivity of neuronal networks from multi-electrode array data. The inference algorithm uses a combination of statistical and deterministic indicators which, first, enables identification of all existing functional links in the network and then reconstructs the directed and causal connection diagram via a super-selective rule enabling highly accurate classification of direct, indirect, and apparent links. Our method can be generally applied to the functional characterization of any in vitro neuronal networks. Here, we show that, given its accuracy, it can offer important insights into the functional development of in vitro hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decreased Functional Connectivity of Vermis-Ventral Prefrontal Cortex in Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.711688</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.711688</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To investigate changes in functional connectivity between the vermis and cerebral regions in the resting state among subjects with bipolar disorder (BD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty participants with BD and 28 healthy controls (HC) underwent the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the anterior and posterior vermis was examined. For each participant, rsFC maps of the anterior and posterior vermis were computed and compared across the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: rsFC between the whole vermis and ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) was significantly lower in the BD groups compared to the HC group, and rsFC between the anterior vermis and the middle cingulate cortex was likewise significantly decreased in the BD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limitations: 83.3% of the BD participants were taking medication at the time of the study. Our findings may in part be attributed to treatment differences because we did not examine the effects of medication on rsFC. Further, the mixed BD subtypes in our current study may have confounding effects influencing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These rsFC differences of vermis-VPFC between groups may contribute to the BD mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Blindness Limits the Head-Trunk Coordination Development for Horizontal Reorientation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.699312</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.699312</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;During locomotion, goal-directed orientation movements in the horizontal plane require a high degree of head-trunk coordination. This coordination is acquired during childhood. Since early visual loss is linked to motor control deficits, we hypothesize that it may also affect the development of head-trunk coordination for horizontal rotations. However, no direct evidence exists about such a deficit. To assess this hypothesis, we tested early blind and sighted individuals on dynamic sound alignment through a head-pointing task with sounds delivered in acoustic virtual reality. Participants could perform the head-pointing with no constraints, or they were asked to immobilize their trunk voluntarily. Kinematics of head and trunk were assessed individually and with respect to each other, together with spatial task performance. Results indicated a head-trunk coordination deficit in the early blind group; yet, they could dampen their trunk movements so as not to let their coordination deficit affect spatial performance. This result highlights the role of vision in the development of head-trunk coordination for goal-directed horizontal rotations. It also calls for clarification on the impact of the blindness-related head-trunk coordination deficit on the performance of more complex tasks akin to daily life activities such as steering during locomotion or reaching to targets placed sideways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Functional Changes in Stroke Following Rehabilitation Using Brain-Computer Interface-Assisted Motor Imagery With and Without tDCS: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.692304</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.692304</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proven effective in post-stroke motor function enhancement, yet whether the combination of MI-BCI and tDCS may further benefit the rehabilitation of motor functions remains unknown. This study investigated brain functional activity and connectivity changes after a 2 week MI-BCI and tDCS combined intervention in 19 chronic subcortical stroke patients. Patients were randomized into MI-BCI with tDCS group and MI-BCI only group who underwent 10 sessions of 20 min real or sham tDCS followed by 1 h MI-BCI training with robotic feedback. We derived amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, stroke patients had lower ALFF in the ipsilesional somatomotor network (SMN), lower ReHo in the contralesional insula, and higher ALFF/Reho in the bilateral posterior default mode network (DMN) compared to age-matched healthy controls. After the intervention, the MI-BCI only group showed increased ALFF in contralesional SMN and decreased ALFF/Reho in the posterior DMN. In contrast, no post-intervention changes were detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Furthermore, higher increases in ALFF/ReHo/FC measures were related to better motor function recovery (measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores) in the MI-BCI group while the opposite association was detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain functional re-normalization and network-specific compensation were found in the MI-BCI only group but not in the MI-BCI + tDCS group although both groups gained significant motor function improvement post-intervention with no group difference. MI-BCI and tDCS may exert differential or even opposing impact on brain functional reorganization during post-stroke motor rehabilitation; therefore, the integration of the two strategies requires further refinement to improve efficacy and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prediction of Second Language Proficiency Based on Electroencephalographic Signals Measured While Listening to Natural Speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.665809</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.665809</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study had two goals: to clarify the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) features estimated while non-native speakers listened to a second language (L2) and their proficiency in L2 determined by a conventional paper test and to provide a predictive model for L2 proficiency based on EEG features. We measured EEG signals from 205 native Japanese speakers, who varied widely in English proficiency while they listened to natural speech in English. Following the EEG measurement, they completed a conventional English listening test for Japanese speakers. We estimated multivariate temporal response functions separately for word class, speech rate, word position, and parts of speech. We found significant negative correlations between listening score and 17 EEG features, which included peak latency of early components (corresponding to N1 and P2) for both open and closed class words and peak latency and amplitude of a late component (corresponding to N400) for open class words. On the basis of the EEG features, we generated a predictive model for Japanese speakers’ English listening proficiency. The correlation coefficient between the true and predicted listening scores was 0.51. Our results suggest that L2 or foreign language ability can be assessed using neural signatures measured while listening to natural speech, without the need of a conventional paper test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Determination of Dynamic Brain Connectivity via Spectral Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655576</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655576</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spectral analysis based on neural field theory is used to analyze dynamic connectivity via methods based on the physical eigenmodes that are the building blocks of brain dynamics. These approaches integrate over space instead of averaging over time and thereby greatly reduce or remove the temporal averaging effects, windowing artifacts, and noise at fine spatial scales that have bedeviled the analysis of dynamical functional connectivity (FC). The dependences of FC on dynamics at various timescales, and on windowing, are clarified and the results are demonstrated on simple test cases, demonstrating how modes provide directly interpretable insights that can be related to brain structure and function. It is shown that FC is dynamic even when the brain structure and effective connectivity are fixed, and that the observed patterns of FC are dominated by relatively few eigenmodes. Common artifacts introduced by statistical analyses that do not incorporate the physical nature of the brain are discussed and it is shown that these are avoided by spectral analysis using eigenmodes. Unlike most published artificially discretized “resting state networks” and other statistically-derived patterns, eigenmodes overlap, with every mode extending across the whole brain and every region participating in every mode—just like the vibrations that give rise to notes of a musical instrument. Despite this, modes are independent and do not interact in the linear limit. It is argued that for many purposes the intrinsic limitations of covariance-based FC instead favor the alternative of tracking eigenmode coefficients vs. time, which provide a compact representation that is directly related to biophysical brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurobehavioral, Neuromotor, and Neurocognitive Effects in Agricultural Workers and Their Children Exposed to Pyrethroid Pesticides: A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648171</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648171</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, pyrethroids have emerged as a less toxic alternative to eliminate insect pests. However, some animal studies and studies with children show that these pesticides are toxic and lead to neurobehavioral effects similar to other pesticides, such as organophosphates. The purpose of this review was to systematize the epidemiological scientific evidence about the neurobehavioral, neuromotor, and neurocognitive effects in agricultural workers and their children exposed to pyrethroid pesticides. We conducted two searches (with different terms) in PubMed and Scopus databases, including articles in Spanish and English language on the effects of occupational exposure to pyrethroid pesticides associated with neurobehavioral, neuromotor, and neurocognitive functioning of agricultural workers and their children. There were no filters by year, and the search included studies till march 2021. To develop the search, we followed the recommendations contained in the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO strategy. The results show that in 66.6% of the studies reviewed (8 of 12 studies), agricultural workers or their children occupationally exposed to pyrethroid pesticides have a higher risk of presenting difficulties in their neurocognitive, neuromotor, or neurobehavioral performance, mainly associated with attention, processing speed (linked to hand-eye coordination), and motor coordination. There are still few studies that address this issue. However, the quality of most of the research conducted (83% intermediate or high quality) confirms the risk for neurobehavioral health in agricultural workers due to occupational exposure to pyrethroids. More research is required evaluating the exposure to pyrethroids, including biomarkers and validated neurobehavioral and neuromotor tests, in addition to evaluating the effect of simultaneous exposure to other hazardous pesticides. Assuming that the use of pyrethroids is increasing considerably and faster than the scientific evidence, it is suggested as a precautionary principle to regulate, more strictly, the sale of pyrethroids and other pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Effects of 1p/19q Codeletion on Immune Phenotype in Low Grade Glioma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.704344</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.704344</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Chromosome 1p/19q codeletion is one of the most important genetic alterations for low grade gliomas (LGGs), and patients with 1p/19q codeletion have significantly prolonged survival compared to those without the codeletion. And the tumor immune microenvironment also plays a vital role in the tumor progression and prognosis. However, the effect of 1p/19q codeletion on the tumor immune microenvironment in LGGs is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Immune cell infiltration of 281 LGGs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 543 LGGs from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were analyzed for immune cell infiltration through three bioinformatics tools: ESTIMATE algorithm, TIMER, and xCell. The infiltrating level of immune cells and expression of immune checkpoint genes were compared between different groups classified by 1p/19q codeletion and IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutation status. The differential biological processes and signaling pathways were evaluated through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Correlations were analyzed using Spearman correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: 1p/19q codeletion was associated with immune-related biological processes in LGGs. The infiltrating level of multiple kinds of immune cells and expression of immune checkpoint genes were significantly lower in 1p/19q codeletion LGGs compared to 1p/19q non-codeletion cohorts. There are 127 immune-related genes on chromosome 1p or 19q, such as TGFB1, JAK1, and CSF1. The mRNA expression of these genes was positively correlated with their DNA copy number. These genes are distributed in multiple immune categories, such as chemokines/cytokines, TGF-β family members, and TNF family members, regulating immune cell infiltration and expression of the immune checkpoint genes in tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results indicated that 1p/19q codeletion status is closely associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment in LGGs. LGGs with 1p/19q codeletion display less immune cell infiltration and lower expression of immune checkpoint genes than 1p/19q non-codeletion cases. Mechanistically, this may be, at least in part, due to the deletion of copy number of immune-related genes in LGGs with 1p/19q codeletion. Our findings may be relevant to investigate immune evasion in LGGs and contribute to the design of immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with LGGs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Large-Scale Open Motion Dataset (KFall) and Benchmark Algorithms for Detecting Pre-impact Fall of the Elderly Using Wearable Inertial Sensors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.692865</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.692865</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research on pre-impact fall detection with wearable inertial sensors (detecting fall accidents prior to body-ground impacts) has grown rapidly in the past decade due to its great potential for developing an on-demand fall-related injury prevention system. However, most researchers use their own datasets to develop fall detection algorithms and rarely make these datasets publicly available, which poses a challenge to fairly evaluate the performance of different algorithms on a common basis. Even though some open datasets have been established recently, most of them are impractical for pre-impact fall detection due to the lack of temporal labels for fall time and limited types of motions. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study, we proposed and publicly provided a large-scale motion dataset called “KFall,” which was developed from 32 Korean participants while wearing an inertial sensor on the low back and performing 21 types of activities of daily living and 15 types of simulated falls. In addition, ready-to-use temporal labels of the fall time based on synchronized motion videos were published along with the dataset. Those enhancements make KFall the first public dataset suitable for pre-impact fall detection, not just for post-fall detection. Importantly, we have also developed three different types of latest algorithms (threshold based, support-vector machine, and deep learning), using the KFall dataset for pre-impact fall detection so that researchers and practitioners can flexibly choose the corresponding algorithm. Deep learning algorithm achieved both high overall accuracy and balanced sensitivity (99.32%) and specificity (99.01%) for pre-impact fall detection. Support vector machine also demonstrated a good performance with a sensitivity of 99.77% and specificity of 94.87%. However, the threshold-based algorithm showed relatively poor results, especially the specificity (83.43%) was much lower than the sensitivity (95.50%). The performance of these algorithms could be regarded as a benchmark for further development of better algorithms with this new dataset. This large-scale motion dataset and benchmark algorithms could provide researchers and practitioners with valuable data and references to develop new technologies and strategies for pre-impact fall detection and proactive injury prevention for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Adaptation of Melodic Intonation Therapy to Greek: A Clinical Study in Broca’s Aphasia With Brain Perfusion SPECT Validation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.664581</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.664581</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) is one of the most well-known treatment methods which is based on pitch and rhythm and was developed to increase verbal output in adults with non-fluent aphasia. Although MIT has been adapted to several languages, in Greece it is almost unknown. The aim of the proposed study is twofold: (1) to translate and adapt the MIT to the Greek language, and (2) to conduct an experimental study in order to examine the effect of MIT on Greek patients with Broca’s aphasia. To this aim, a 64-year-old, right-handed male who had a 6-year primary school education level, no musical abilities and poor performance on the recognition of prosody attended the MIT intervention program almost two and a half years after the event of suffering an ischemic stroke. The MIT intervention was administered three times per week for a 12-week period, in which each session lasted from 30 to 40 min. The patient underwent three assessments all using both the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination–Short Form (BDAE-SF) and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); (1) before the MIT, (2) immediately after, and (3) 3 months after the completion of MIT. The results from the BDAE-SF revealed an impressive improvement on both trained and prepositional speech production, immediately after the completion of the MIT, and a stable improved performance 3 months after MIT. The SPECT scan revealed reactivation of the perilesional areas of the left hemisphere, and considerably improved perfusion of the frontal lobe, the anterior temporal lobe, and the upper part of the parietal lobe of the right hemisphere. The improvement persisted and even expanded 3 months after MIT. Therefore, MIT is a promising intervention program and its positive effects last for at least 3 months after the completion of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging are widely used methods for measuring physiological activity with single-cell resolution across large populations of cortical neurons. While each of these two modalities has distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither provides complete, unbiased information about the underlying neural population. Here, we compare evoked responses in visual cortex recorded in awake mice under highly standardized conditions using either imaging of genetically expressed GCaMP6f or electrophysiology with silicon probes. Across all stimulus conditions tested, we observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging, which was partially reconciled by applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data. However, the forward model could only reconcile differences in responsiveness when restricted to neurons with low contamination and an event rate above a minimum threshold. This work established how the biases of these two modalities impact functional metrics that are fundamental for characterizing sensory-evoked responses.</description>

	<title>eLife: Distinct Synaptic Transfer Functions in Same-Type Photoreceptors</title>

	<description>Many sensory systems use ribbon-type synapses to transmit their signals to downstream circuits. The properties of this synaptic transfer fundamentally dictate which aspects in the original stimulus will be accentuated or suppressed, thereby partially defining the detection limits of the circuit. Accordingly, sensory neurons have evolved a wide variety of ribbon geometries and vesicle pool properties to best support their diverse functional requirements. However, the need for diverse synaptic functions does not only arise across neuron types, but also &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that UV-cones, a single type of photoreceptor of the larval zebrafish eye, exhibit striking differences in their synaptic ultrastructure and consequent calcium to glutamate transfer function depending on their location in the eye. We arrive at this conclusion by combining serial section electron microscopy and simultaneous “dual-colour” 2-photon imaging of calcium and glutamate signals from the same synapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We further use the functional dataset to fit a cascade-like model of the ribbon synapse with different vesicle pool sizes, transfer rates and other synaptic properties. Exploiting recent developments in simulation-based inference, we obtain full posterior estimates for the parameters and compare these across different retinal regions. The model enables us to extrapolate to new stimuli and to systematically investigate different response behaviours of various ribbon configurations. We also provide an interactive, easy-to-use version of this model as an online tool. Overall, we show that already on the synaptic level of single neuron types there exist highly specialized mechanisms which are advantageous for the encoding of different visual features.</description>

	<title>eLife: Homo-oligomerization of the human adenosine A2a receptor is driven by the intrinsically disordered C-terminus</title>

	<description>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have long been shown to exist as oligomers with functional properties distinct from those of the monomeric counterparts, but the driving factors of oligomerization remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we focus on the human adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R), a model GPCR that forms oligomers both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Combining experimental and computational approaches, we discover that the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R drives receptor homo-oligomerization. The formation of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R oligomers declines progressively with the shortening of the C-terminus. Multiple interaction types are responsible for A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R oligomerization, including disulfide linkages, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions are enhanced by depletion interactions, giving rise to a tunable network of bonds that allow A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R oligomers to adopt multiple interfaces. This study uncovers the disordered C-terminus as a prominent driving factor for the oligomerization of a GPCR, offering important insight into the effect of C-terminus modification on receptor oligomerization of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R and other GPCRs reconstituted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; for biophysical studies.</description>

	<description>Vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (VNTs) mediate the selective uptake and enrichment of small molecule neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs) and are therefore a major determinant of the synaptic output of specific neurons. To identify novel VNTs expressed on SVs (thus identifying new neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators), we conducted localization profiling of 361 solute carrier (SLC) transporters tagging with a fluorescent protein in neurons, which revealed 40 possible candidates through comparison with a known SV marker. We parallelly performed proteomics analysis of immunoisolated SVs and identified 7 transporters in overlap. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed one of the transporters, SLC35D3, localized to SVs. Finally, by combining metabolite profiling with a radiolabeled substrate transport assay, we identified UDP-glucose as the principal substrate for SLC35D3. These results provide new insights into the functional role of SLC transporters in neurotransmission and improve our understanding of the molecular diversity of chemical transmitters.</description>

	<title>eLife: Action potential-coupled Rho GTPase signaling drives presynaptic plasticity</title>

	<description>In contrast to their postsynaptic counterparts, the contributions of activity-dependent cytoskeletal signaling to presynaptic plasticity remain controversial and poorly understood. To identify and evaluate these signaling pathways, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the presynaptic cytomatrix using in vivo biotin identification (iBioID). The resultant proteome was heavily enriched for actin cytoskeleton regulators, including Rac1, a Rho GTPase that activates the Arp2/3 complex to nucleate branched actin filaments. Strikingly, we find Rac1 and Arp2/3 are closely associated with synaptic vesicle membranes in adult mice. Using three independent approaches to alter presynaptic Rac1 activity (genetic knockout, spatially restricted inhibition, and temporal optogenetic manipulation), we discover that this pathway negatively regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, bidirectionally sculpting short-term synaptic depression. Finally, we use two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging to show that presynaptic Rac1 activation is coupled to action potentials by voltage-gated calcium influx. Thus, this study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism of actin-regulated short-term presynaptic plasticity that is conserved across excitatory and inhibitory terminals. It also provides a new proteomic framework for better understanding presynaptic physiology, along with a blueprint of experimental strategies to isolate the presynaptic effects of ubiquitously expressed proteins.</description>

	<description>Actin filaments are central to numerous biological processes in all domains of life. Driven by the interplay with molecular motors, actin binding and actin modulating proteins, the actin cytoskeleton exhibits a variety of geometries. This includes structures with a curved geometry such as axon-stabilizing actin rings, actin cages around mitochondria and the cytokinetic actomyosin ring, which are generally assumed to be formed by short linear filaments held together by actin cross-linkers. However, whether individual actin filaments in these structures could be curved and how they may assume a curved geometry remains unknown. Here, we show that 'curly', a region from the IQGAP family of proteins from three different organisms, comprising the actin-binding calponin-homology domain and a C-terminal unstructured domain, stabilizes individual actin filaments in a curved geometry when anchored to lipid membranes. Whereas F-actin is semi-flexible with a persistence length of ~10 mm, binding of mobile curly within lipid membranes generates actin filament arcs and full rings of high curvature with radii below 1 mm. Higher rates of fully formed actin rings are observed in the presence of the actin-binding coiled-coil protein tropomyosin and when actin is directly polymerized on lipid membranes decorated with curly. Strikingly, curly induced actin filament rings contract upon the addition of muscle myosin II filaments and expression of curly in mammalian cells leads to highly curved actin structures in the cytoskeleton. Taken together, our work identifies a new mechanism to generate highly curved actin filaments, which opens a range of possibilities to control actin filament geometries, that can be used, for example, in designing synthetic cytoskeletal structures.</description>

What humans do when exposed to uncertainty, incomplete information, and a dynamic environment influenced by other agents remains an open scientific challenge with important implications in both science and engineering applications. In these contexts, humans handle social situations by employing elaborate cognitive mechanisms such as theory of mind and risk sensitivity. Here we resort to a novel theoretical model, showing that both mechanisms leverage coordinated behaviors among self-regarding individuals. Particularly, we resort to cumulative prospect theory and level-&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; recursions to show how biases towards optimism and the capacity of planning ahead significantly increase coordinated, cooperative action. These results suggest that the reason why humans are good at coordination may stem from the fact that we are cognitively biased to do so.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zFZqp0O5tk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Data integration uncovers the metabolic bases of phenotypic variation in yeast</title>

The relationship between different levels of integration is a key feature for understanding the genotype-phenotype map. Here, we describe a novel method of integrated data analysis that incorporates protein abundance data into constraint-based modeling to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation. Specifically, we studied yeast genetic diversity at three levels of phenotypic complexity in a population of yeast obtained by pairwise crosses of eleven strains belonging to two species, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. uvarum&lt;/i&gt;. The data included protein abundances, integrated traits (life-history/fermentation) and computational estimates of metabolic fluxes. Results highlighted that the negative correlation between production traits such as population carrying capacity (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;) and traits associated with growth and fermentation rates (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) is explained by a differential usage of energy production pathways: a high &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; was associated with high TCA fluxes, while a high &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was associated with high glycolytic fluxes. Enrichment analysis of protein sets confirmed our results.
This powerful approach allowed us to identify the molecular and metabolic bases of integrated trait variation, and therefore has a broad applicability domain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cMLQvW4dQ3c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sperm migration in the genital tract—&lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments identify key factors for reproductive success</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorin Diemer, Jens Hahn, Björn Goldenbogen, Karin Müller, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

Sperm migration in the female genital tract controls sperm selection and, therefore, reproductive success as male gametes are conditioned for fertilization while their number is dramatically reduced. Mechanisms underlying sperm migration are mostly unknown, since &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; investigations are mostly unfeasible for ethical or practical reasons. By presenting a spatio-temporal model of the mammalian female genital tract combined with agent-based description of sperm motion and interaction as well as parameterizing it with bovine data, we offer an alternative possibility for studying sperm migration &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;. The model incorporates genital tract geometry as well as biophysical principles of sperm motion observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; such as positive rheotaxis and thigmotaxis. This model for sperm migration from vagina to oviducts was successfully tested against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from literature. We found that physical sperm characteristics such as velocity and directional stability as well as sperm-fluid interactions and wall alignment are critical for success, i.e. sperms reaching the oviducts. Therefore, we propose that these identified sperm parameters should be considered in detail for conditioning sperm in artificial selection procedures since the natural processes are normally bypassed in reproductive &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; technologies. The tremendous impact of mucus flow to support sperm accumulation in the oviduct highlights the importance of a species-specific optimum time window for artificial insemination regarding ovulation. Predictions from our extendable &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experimental system will improve assisted reproduction in humans, endangered species, and livestock.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gms45Y-L5pM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Accumulation of continuously time-varying sensory evidence constrains neural and behavioral responses in human collision threat detection</title>

Evidence accumulation models provide a dominant account of human decision-making, and have been particularly successful at explaining behavioral and neural data in laboratory paradigms using abstract, stationary stimuli. It has been proposed, but with limited in-depth investigation so far, that similar decision-making mechanisms are involved in tasks of a more embodied nature, such as movement and locomotion, by directly accumulating externally measurable sensory quantities of which the precise, typically continuously time-varying, magnitudes are important for successful behavior. Here, we leverage collision threat detection as a task which is ecologically relevant in this sense, but which can also be rigorously observed and modelled in a laboratory setting. Conventionally, it is assumed that humans are limited in this task by a perceptual threshold on the optical expansion rate–the visual looming–of the obstacle. Using concurrent recordings of EEG and behavioral responses, we disprove this conventional assumption, and instead provide strong evidence that humans detect collision threats by accumulating the continuously time-varying visual looming signal. Generalizing existing accumulator model assumptions from stationary to time-varying sensory evidence, we show that our model accounts for previously unexplained empirical observations and full distributions of detection response. We replicate a pre-response centroparietal positivity (CPP) in scalp potentials, which has previously been found to correlate with accumulated decision evidence. In contrast with these existing findings, we show that our model is capable of predicting the onset of the CPP signature rather than its buildup, suggesting that neural evidence accumulation is implemented differently, possibly in distinct brain regions, in collision detection compared to previously studied paradigms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PDboPX3U6m4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells polarize their movement or growth toward external directional cues in many different contexts. For example, budding yeast cells grow toward potential mating partners in response to pheromone gradients. Directed growth is controlled by polarity factors that assemble into clusters at the cell membrane. The clusters assemble, disassemble, and move between different regions of the membrane before eventually forming a stable polarity site directed toward the pheromone source. Pathways that regulate clustering have been identified but the molecular mechanisms that regulate cluster mobility are not well understood. To gain insight into the contribution of chemical noise to cluster behavior we simulated clustering within the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) framework to account for molecular-level fluctuations. RDME simulations are a computationally efficient approximation, but their results can diverge from the underlying microscopic dynamics. We implemented novel concentration-dependent rate constants that improved the accuracy of RDME-based simulations of cluster behavior, allowing us to efficiently investigate how cluster dynamics might be regulated. Molecular noise was effective in relocating clusters when the clusters contained low numbers of limiting polarity factors, and when Cdc42, the central polarity regulator, exhibited short dwell times at the polarity site. Cluster stabilization occurred when abundances or binding rates were altered to either lengthen dwell times or increase the number of polarity molecules in the cluster. We validated key results using full 3D particle-based simulations. Understanding the mechanisms cells use to regulate the dynamics of polarity clusters should provide insights into how cells dynamically track external directional cues.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ep8HAQv7VdA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Origins of 1/f-like tissue oxygenation fluctuations in the murine cortex</title>

The concentration of oxygen in the brain spontaneously fluctuates, and the distribution of power in these fluctuations has a 1/f-like spectra, where the power present at low frequencies of the power spectrum is orders of magnitude higher than at higher frequencies. Though these oscillations have been interpreted as being driven by neural activity, the origin of these 1/f-like oscillations is not well understood. Here, to gain insight of the origin of the 1/f-like oxygen fluctuations, we investigated the dynamics of tissue oxygenation and neural activity in awake behaving mice. We found that oxygen signal recorded from the cortex of mice had 1/f-like spectra. However, band-limited power in the local field potential did not show corresponding 1/f-like fluctuations. When local neural activity was suppressed, the 1/f-like fluctuations in oxygen concentration persisted. Two-photon measurements of erythrocyte spacing fluctuations and mathematical modeling show that stochastic fluctuations in erythrocyte flow could underlie 1/f-like dynamics in oxygenation. These results suggest that the discrete nature of erythrocytes and their irregular flow, rather than fluctuations in neural activity, could drive 1/f-like fluctuations in tissue oxygenation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4DhxNkqSHqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The body of most creatures is composed of interconnected joints. During motion, the spatial location of these joints changes, but they must maintain their distances to one another, effectively moving semirigidly. This pattern, termed “biological motion” in the literature, can be used as a visual cue, enabling many animals (including humans) to distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Crucially, even artificially created scrambled stimuli, with no recognizable structure but that maintains semirigid movement patterns, are perceived as animated. However, to date, biological motion perception has only been reported in vertebrates. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex visual behaviors, we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from nonbiological motion using point-light display stimuli. These kinds of stimuli maintain motion information while being devoid of structure. By constraining spiders on a spherical treadmill, we simultaneously presented 2 point-light displays with specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing which pattern they turned toward. Spiders clearly demonstrated the ability to discriminate between biological motion and random stimuli, but curiously turned preferentially toward the latter. However, they showed no preference between biological and scrambled displays, results that match responses produced by vertebrates. Crucially, spiders turned toward the stimuli when these were only visible by the lateral eyes, evidence that this task may be eye specific. This represents the first demonstration of biological motion recognition in an invertebrate, posing crucial questions about the evolutionary history of this ability and complex visual processing in nonvertebrate systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jQzDXvO9mUw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

PhD-trained scientists are essential contributors to the workforce in diverse employment sectors that include academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations. Hence, best practices for training the future biomedical workforce are of national concern. Complementing coursework and laboratory research training, many institutions now offer professional training that enables career exploration and develops a broad set of skills critical to various career paths. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded academic institutions to design innovative programming to enable this professional development through a mechanism known as Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST). Programming at the NIH BEST awardee institutions included career panels, skill-building workshops, job search workshops, site visits, and internships. Because doctoral training is lengthy and requires focused attention on dissertation research, an initial concern was that students participating in additional complementary training activities might exhibit an increased time to degree or diminished research productivity. Metrics were analyzed from 10 NIH BEST awardee institutions to address this concern, using time to degree and publication records as measures of efficiency and productivity. Comparing doctoral students who participated to those who did not, results revealed that across these diverse academic institutions, there were no differences in time to degree or manuscript output. Our findings support the policy that doctoral students should participate in career and professional development opportunities that are intended to prepare them for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SSF8SOyNgz4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Orexin (hypocretin) mediates light‐dependent fluctuation of hippocampal function in a diurnal rodent</title>

	<description>Abstract
Environmental lighting conditions play a central role in cognitive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing a diurnal rodent model, the Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), we previously found that daytime light intensity affects hippocampal function in this species in a manner similar to its effects in humans. Compared to animals housed in a 12:12 h bright light–dark (brLD) cycle, grass rats kept in a 12:12 h dim light–dark (dimLD) cycle showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. The present study explored the neural substrates mediating the effects of daylight intensity on hippocampal function focusing on the hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system. First, animals housed in dimLD were treated with daily intranasal administration of orexin A peptide over five training days of the MWM task. Compared to vehicle controls, this treatment led to superior spatial memory accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II α and glutamate receptor 1 within the CA1. To assess the role of hippocampal orexinergic signaling, an adeno‐associated viral vector (AAV) expressing an orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) shRNA was injected into the dorsal hippocampus targeting the CA1 of animals housed in brLD. AAV‐mediated knockdown of OX1R within the hippocampus resulted in deficits in MWM performance and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. These results are consistent with the view that the hypothalamic orexinergic system underlies the modulatory role of daytime illumination on hippocampal function in diurnal mammals.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral striatum, also called nucleus accumbens (NAc), has long been known to integrate information from cortical, thalamic, midbrain and limbic nuclei to mediate goal-directed behaviors. Until recently thalamic afferents have been overlooked when studying the functions and connectivity of the NAc. However, findings from recent studies have shed light on the importance and roles of precise Thalamus to NAc connections in motivated behaviors and in addiction. In this review, we summarize studies using techniques such as chemo- and optogenetics, electrophysiology and in vivo calcium imaging to elucidate the complex functioning of the thalamo-NAc afferents, with a particular highlight on the projections from the Paraventricular Thalamus (PVT) to the NAc. We will focus on the recent advances in the understanding of the roles of these neuronal connections in motivated behaviors, with a special emphasis on their implications in addiction, from cue-reward association to the mechanisms driving relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Plasticity of GluN1 at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the infralimbic cortex (IL) is not thought to play a role in fear acquisition, recent experiments found evidence that synaptic plasticity is occurring at ventral hippocampal (vHPC) synapses in IL during auditory fear acquisition as measured by changes in the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents in male rats. These electrophysiological data suggest that fear conditioning changes the expression of NMDA receptors on vHPC-to-IL synapses. To further evaluate the plasticity of NMDA receptors at this specific synapse, we injected AAV particles expressing channelrhodopsin-EYFP into the vHPC of male and female rats to label vHPC projections with EYFP. To test for NMDA receptor changes in vHPC-to-IL synapses after fear learning, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to quantify synaptosomes isolated from IL tissue punches that were positive for EYFP and the obligatory GluN1 subunit. More EYFP+/GluN1+ synaptosomes with greater average expression of GluN1 were isolated from male rats exposed to auditory fear conditioning (AFC) than those exposed to context and tones only or to contextual fear conditioning (CFC), suggesting that AFC increased NMDA receptor expression in males. In a second experiment, we found that pairing the tones and shocks was required to induce the molecular changes and that fear extinction did not reverse the changes. In contrast, females showed similar levels of EYFP+/GluN1+ synaptosomes in all behavioral groups. These findings suggest that AFC induces synaptic plasticity of NMDA receptors in the vHPC-to-IL projection in males, while female rats rely on different synaptic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuromodulation and Behavioral Flexibility in Larval Zebrafish: From Neurotransmitters to Circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals adapt their behaviors to their ever-changing needs. Internal states, such as hunger, fear, stress, and arousal are important behavioral modulators controlling the way an organism perceives sensory stimuli and reacts to them. The translucent zebrafish larva is an ideal model organism for studying neuronal circuits regulating brain states, owning to the possibility of easy imaging and manipulating activity of genetically identified neurons while the animal performs stereotyped and well-characterized behaviors. The main neuromodulatory circuits present in mammals can also be found in the larval zebrafish brain, with the advantage that they contain small numbers of neurons. Importantly, imaging and behavioral techniques can be combined with methods for generating targeted genetic modifications to reveal the molecular underpinnings mediating the functions of such circuits. In this review we discuss how studying the larval zebrafish brain has contributed to advance our understanding of circuits and molecular mechanisms regulating neuromodulation and behavioral flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cell-Type-Specific High Throughput Toxicity Testing in Human Midbrain Organoids</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.715054</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Toxicity testing is a crucial step in the development and approval of chemical compounds for human contact and consumption. However, existing model systems often fall short in their prediction of human toxicity in vivo because they may not sufficiently recapitulate human physiology. The complexity of three-dimensional (3D) human organ-like cell culture systems (“organoids”) can generate potentially more relevant models of human physiology and disease, including toxicity predictions. However, so far, the inherent biological heterogeneity and cumbersome generation and analysis of organoids has rendered efficient, unbiased, high throughput evaluation of toxic effects in these systems challenging. Recent advances in both standardization and quantitative fluorescent imaging enabled us to dissect the toxicities of compound exposure to separate cellular subpopulations within human organoids at the single-cell level in a framework that is compatible with high throughput approaches. Screening a library of 84 compounds in standardized human automated midbrain organoids (AMOs) generated from two independent cell lines correctly recognized known nigrostriatal toxicants. This approach further identified the flame retardant 3,3′,5,5′-tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) as a selective toxicant for dopaminergic neurons in the context of human midbrain-like tissues for the first time. Results were verified with high reproducibility in more detailed dose-response experiments. Further, we demonstrate higher sensitivity in 3D AMOs than in 2D cultures to the known neurotoxic effects of the pesticide lindane. Overall, the automated nature of our workflow is freely scalable and demonstrates the feasibility of quantitatively assessing cell-type-specific toxicity in human organoids in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: How to Arrange Follow-Up Time-Intervals for Longitudinal Brain MRI Studies in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal brain MRI monitoring in neurodegeneration potentially provides substantial insights into the temporal dynamics of the underlying biological process, but is time- and cost-intensive and may be a burden to patients with disabling neurological diseases. Thus, the conceptualization of follow-up time-intervals in longitudinal MRI studies is an essential challenge and substantial for the results. The objective of this work is to discuss the association of time-intervals and the results of longitudinal trends in the frequently used design of one baseline and two follow-up scans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Different analytical approaches for calculating the linear trend of longitudinal parameters were studied in simulations including their performance of dealing with outliers; these simulations were based on the longitudinal striatum atrophy in MRI data of Huntington’s disease patients, detected by atlas-based volumetry (ABV).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For the design of one baseline and two follow-up visits, the simulations with outliers revealed optimum results for identical time-intervals between baseline and follow-up scans. However, identical time-intervals between the three acquisitions lead to the paradox that, depending on the fit method, the first follow-up scan results do not influence the final results of a linear trend analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;This theoretical study analyses how the design of longitudinal imaging studies with one baseline and two follow-up visits influences the results. Suggestions for the analysis of longitudinal trends are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Evaluation of Multilevel Surgeries in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy Based on Surface Electromyography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680645</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680645</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The root mean square (RMS) of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal can respond to neuromuscular function, which displays a positive correlation with muscle force and muscle tension under positive and passive conditions, respectively. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in muscle force and tension after multilevel surgical treatments, functional selective posterior rhizotomy (FSPR) and tibial anterior muscle transfer surgery, and evaluate their clinical effect in children with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) during walking. Children with diplegia (n = 13) and hemiplegia (n = 3) with ages from 4 to 18 years participated in this study. They were requested to walk barefoot at a self-selected speed on a 15-m-long lane. The patient's joints' range of motion (ROM) and sEMG signal of six major muscles were assessed before and after the multilevel surgeries. The gait cycle was divided into seven phases, and muscle activation state can be divided into positive and passive conditions during gait cycle. For each phase, the RMS of the sEMG signal amplitude was calculated and also normalized by a linear envelope (10-ms running RMS window). The muscle tension of the gastrocnemius decreased significantly during the loading response, initial swing, and terminal swing (p &amp;lt; 0.05), which helped the knee joint to get the maximum extension when the heel is on the ground and made the heel land smoothly. The muscle force of the gastrocnemius increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during the mid-stance, terminal stance, and pre-swing, which could generate the driving force for the human body to move forward. The muscle tension of the biceps femoris and semitendinosus decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during the terminal stance, pre-swing, and initial swing. The decreased muscle tension could relieve the burden of the knee flexion when the knee joint was passively flexed. At the terminal swing, the muscle force of the tibial anterior increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05), which could improve the ankle dorsiflexion ability and prevent foot drop and push forward. Thus, the neuromuscular function of cerebral palsy during walking can be evaluated by the muscle activation state and the RMS of the sEMG signal, which showed that multilevel surgical treatments are feasible and effective to treat SCP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Computerized Dual-Task Testing of Gait Visuomotor and Cognitive Functions in Parkinson’s Disease: Test-Retest Reliability and Validity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.706230</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Mobility and cognitive impairments in Parkinson’s disease (PD) often coexist and are prognostic of adverse health events. Consequently, assessment and training that simultaneously address both gait function and cognition are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy aging. For this purpose, a computer game-based rehabilitation treadmill platform (GRP) was developed for dual-task (DT) assessment and training.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The first objective was to establish the test-retest reliability of the GRP assessment protocol for DT gait, visuomotor and executive cognitive function in PD patients. The second objective was to examine the effect of task condition [single task (ST) vs. DT] and disease severity (stage 2 vs. stage 3) on gait, visuomotor and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty individuals aged 55 to 70 years, diagnosed with PD; 15 each at Hoehn and Yahr scale stage 2 (PD-2) and 3 (PD-3) performed a series of computerized visuomotor and cognitive game tasks while sitting (ST) and during treadmill walking (DT). A treadmill instrumented with a pressure mat was used to record center of foot pressure and compute the average and coefficient of variation (COV) of step time, step length, and drift during 1-min, speed-controlled intervals. Visuomotor and cognitive game performance measures were quantified using custom software. Testing was conducted on two occasions, 1 week apart.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;With few exceptions, the assessment protocol showed moderate to high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values under both ST and DT conditions for the spatio-temporal gait measures (average and COV), as well as the visuomotor tracking and cognitive game performance measures. A significant decline in gait, visuomotor, and cognitive game performance measures was observed during DT compared to ST conditions, and in the PD-3 compared to PD-2 groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The high to moderate ICC values along with the lack of systematic errors in the measures indicate that this tool has the ability to repeatedly record reliable DT interference (DTI) effects over time. The use of interactive digital media provides a flexible method to produce and evaluate DTI for a wide range of executive cognitive activities. This also proves to be a sensitive tool for tracking disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03232996.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Interbrain Synchrony of Team Collaborative Decision-Making: An fNIRS Hyperscanning Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.702959</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.702959</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many situations, decision-making behaviors are mostly composed of team patterns (i.e., more than two persons). However, brain-based models that inform how team interactions contribute and impact team collaborative decision-making (TCDM) behavior, is lacking. To examine the neural substrates activated during TCDM in realistic, interpersonal interaction contexts, dyads were asked to model TCDM toward their opponent, in a multi-person prisoner’s dilemma game, while neural activity was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy. These experiments resulted in two main findings. First, there are different neural substrates between TCDM and ISDM, which were modulated by social environmental cues. i.e., the low incentive reward yielded higher activation within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), in individual separately decision-making (ISDM) stage while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the middle frontopolar area was activated in TCDM stage. The high incentive reward evoked a higher interbrain synchrony (IBS) value in the right IFG in TCDM stage. Second, males showed higher activation in the DLPFC and the middle frontopolar area during ISDM, while females evoked higher IBS in the right IFG during TCDM. These sex effects suggest that in individual social dilemma situations, males and females may separately depend on non-social and social cognitive ability to make decisions, while in the social interaction situations of TCDM, females may depend on both social and non-social cognitive abilities. This study provide a compelling basis and interesting perspective for future neuroscience work of TCDM behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Adaptation of the Compensatory Stepping Response Following Predictable and Unpredictable Perturbation Training</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674960</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Effective training of the backward step response could be beneficial to improve postural stability and prevent falls. Unpredicted perturbation-based balance training (PBT), widely known as compensatory-step training, may enhance the fear of falling and the patterns of postural muscle co-contraction. Contrastingly, PBT with predictable direction or both direction and timing would suppress the fear and the co-contraction patterns during training, but the efficacy of predictable PBT for unpredictable perturbations is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To compare the adaptation effects of compensatory-step training with and without predictable perturbations on backward stepping against unpredictable perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-three healthy young adults were randomly assigned to one of the following step training groups: Unpredicted, Predicted, and Self-initiated. In training sessions, participants were perturbed to induce a compensatory step with (Predicted group) or without (Unpredicted group) knowledge of the perturbation’s direction or while knowing both the direction and timing of the perturbation (Self-initiated group). In test sessions (pre- and post-training), participants were instructed to recover their postural stability in response to an unpredicted perturbation. The margin of stability (MOS), center of mass (COM) shift, and step characteristics were measured during a backward step in both test and training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All three groups showed a significant increase in the step length and velocity in the post-training sessions compared to those in the pre-training sessions. Moreover, in the Unpredicted and Predicted groups, but not in the Self-initiated group, the MOS at step contact was significantly increased following the training session. In addition, the Self-initiated group showed a significant increase in COM shift at 50 ms after slip onset during training compared to the Unpredicted and Predicted groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Unpredicted and predicted PBT improve step characteristics during backward stepping against unpredictable perturbations. Moreover, the unpredictable PBT and PBT with direction-predictable perturbations enhance the feedback postural control reflected as the postural stability at step contact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Cortical Connectivity Related to Postural Control in Patients Six Weeks After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655116</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655116</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas initial findings have already identified cortical patterns accompanying proprioceptive deficiencies in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), little is known about compensatory sensorimotor mechanisms for re-establishing postural control. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore leg dependent patterns of cortical contributions to postural control in patients 6 weeks following ACLR. A total of 12 patients after ACLR (25.1 ± 3.2 years, 178.1 ± 9.7 cm, 77.5 ± 14.4 kg) and another 12 gender, age, and activity matched healthy controls participated in this study. All subjects performed 10 × 30 s. single leg stances on each leg, equipped with 64-channel mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Postural stability was quantified by area of sway and sway velocity. Estimations of the weighted phase lag index were conducted as a cortical measure of functional connectivity. The findings showed significant group × leg interactions for increased functional connectivity in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injured leg, predominantly including fronto−parietal [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 22)&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.41, p ≤ 0.008, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.28], fronto−occipital [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 22)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.43, p ≤ 0.047, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17], parieto−motor [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 22)&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.30, p ≤ 0.004, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.32], occipito−motor [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 22)&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.21, p ≤ 0.032, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19], and occipito−parietal [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 22)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.60, p ≤ 0.043, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17] intra−hemispherical connections in the contralateral hemisphere and occipito−motor [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 22)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.33, p ≤ 0.013, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.25] on the ipsilateral hemisphere to the injured leg. Higher functional connectivity in patients after ACLR, attained by increased emphasis of functional connections incorporating the somatosensory and visual areas, may serve as a compensatory mechanism to control postural stability of the injured leg in the early phase of rehabilitation. These preliminary results may help to develop new neurophysiological assessments for detecting functional deficiencies after ACLR in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intrinsic Network Brain Dysfunction Correlates With Temporal Complexity in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.647518</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.647518</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are the two severe subtypes of anxiety disorders (ADs), which are similar in clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, and treatment. Earlier studies have taken a whole-brain perspective on GAD and PD in the assumption that intrinsic fluctuations are static throughout the entire scan. However, it has recently been suggested that the dynamic alternations in functional connectivity (FC) may reflect the changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying the critical aspects of cognition and behavior, and thus may act as biomarkers of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, the resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected from 26 patients with GAD, 22 patients with PD, and 26 healthy controls (HCs). We investigated dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) by using the group spatial independent component analysis, a sliding window approach, and the k-means clustering methods. For group comparisons, the temporal properties of DFC states were analyzed statistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The dynamic analysis demonstrated two discrete connectivity “States” across the entire group, namely, a more segregated State I and a strongly integrated State II. Compared with HCs, patients with both GAD and PD spent more time in the weakly within-network State I, while performing fewer transitions and dwelling shorter in the integrated State II. Additionally, the analysis of DFC strength showed that connections associated with ADs were identified including the regions that belonged to default mode (DM), executive control (EC), and salience (SA) networks, especially the connections between SA and DM networks. However, no significant difference was found between the GAD and PD groups in temporal features and connection strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: More common but less specific alterations were detected in the GAD and PD groups, which implied that they might have similar state-dependent neurophysiological mechanisms and, in addition, could hopefully help us better understand their abnormal affective and cognitive performances in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Multiple Sources of Cholinergic Input to the Superior Olivary Complex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.715369</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.715369</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The superior olivary complex (SOC) is a major computation center in the brainstem auditory system. Despite previous reports of high expression levels of cholinergic receptors in the SOC, few studies have addressed the functional role of acetylcholine in the region. The source of the cholinergic innervation is unknown for all but one of the nuclei of the SOC, limiting our understanding of cholinergic modulation. The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a key inhibitory link in monaural and binaural circuits, receives cholinergic input from other SOC nuclei and also from the pontomesencephalic tegmentum. Here, we investigate whether these same regions are sources of cholinergic input to other SOC nuclei. We also investigate whether individual cholinergic cells can send collateral projections bilaterally (i.e., into both SOCs), as has been shown at other levels of the subcortical auditory system. We injected retrograde tract tracers into the SOC in gerbils, then identified retrogradely-labeled cells that were also immunolabeled for choline acetyltransferase, a marker for cholinergic cells. We found that both the SOC and the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT) send cholinergic projections into the SOC, and these projections appear to innervate all major SOC nuclei. We also observed a small cholinergic projection into the SOC from the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus of the reticular formation. These various sources likely serve different functions; e.g., the PMT has been associated with things such as arousal and sensory gating whereas the SOC may provide feedback more closely tuned to specific auditory stimuli. Further, individual cholinergic neurons in each of these regions can send branching projections into both SOCs. Such projections present an opportunity for cholinergic modulation to be coordinated across the auditory brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Single Cell Transcriptomics of Ependymal Cells Across Age, Region and Species Reveals Cilia-Related and Metal Ion Regulatory Roles as Major Conserved Ependymal Cell Functions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ependymal cells are ciliated-epithelial glial cells that develop from radial glia along the surface of the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They play a critical role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis, brain metabolism, and the clearance of waste from the brain. These cells have been implicated in disease across the lifespan including developmental disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. Despite this, ependymal cells remain largely understudied. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data extracted from publicly available datasets, we make key findings regarding the remarkable conservation of ependymal cell gene signatures across age, region, and species. Through this unbiased analysis, we have discovered that one of the most overrepresented ependymal cell functions that we observed relates to a critically understudied role in metal ion homeostasis. Our analysis also revealed distinct subtypes and states of ependymal cells across regions and ages of the nervous system. For example, neonatal ependymal cells maintained a gene signature consistent with developmental processes such as determination of left/right symmetry; while adult ventricular ependymal cells, not spinal canal ependymal cells, appeared to express genes involved in regulating cellular transport and inflammation. Together, these findings highlight underappreciated functions of ependymal cells, which will be important to investigate in order to better understand these cells in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Temporal Activity of CA1 Neurons Underlying Short-Term Memory for Social Recognition Altered in PTEN Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory-guided social recognition identifies someone from previous encounters or experiences, but the mechanisms of social memory remain unclear. Here, we find that a short-term memory from experiencing a stranger mouse lasting under 30 min interval is essential for subsequent social recognition in mice, but that interval prolonged to hours by replacing the stranger mouse with a familiar littermate. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal CA1 neuronal activity during trials or inter-trial intervals disrupted short-term memory-guided social recognition, without affecting the ability of being sociable or long-term memory-guided social recognition. Postnatal knockdown or knockout of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-associated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene in dorsal hippocampal CA1 similarly impaired neuronal firing rate in vitro and altered firing pattern during social recognition. These PTEN mice showed deficits in social recognition with stranger mouse rather than littermate and exhibited impairment in T-maze spontaneous alternation task for testing short-term spatial memory. Thus, we suggest that a temporal activity of dorsal CA1 neurons may underlie formation of short-term memory to be critical for organizing subsequent social recognition but that is possibly disrupted in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decades, microbiome research has evolved rapidly and became a hot topic in basic, preclinical and clinical research, for the pharmaceutical industry and for the general public. With the help of new high-throughput sequencing technologies tremendous progress has been made in the characterization of host-microbiota interactions identifying the microbiome as a major factor shaping mammalian physiology. This development also led to the discovery of the gut-brain axis as the crucial connection between gut microbiota and the nervous system. Consequently, a rapidly growing body of evidence emerged suggesting that the commensal gut microbiota plays a vital role in brain physiology. Moreover, it became evident that the communication along this microbiota-gut-brain axis is bidirectional and primarily mediated by biologically active microbial molecules and metabolites. Further, intestinal dysbiosis leading to changes in the bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota and the nervous system was linked to the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurological disorders. Here, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiota on the brain in health and disease, specifically as regards to neuronal homeostasis, development and normal aging as well as their role in neurological diseases of the highest socioeconomic burden such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. Subsequently, we utilize Alzheimer’s disease and stroke to examine the translational research value of current mouse models in the spotlight of microbiome research. Finally, we propose future strategies on how we could conduct translational microbiome research in the field of neuroscience that may lead to the identification of novel treatments for human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ferroptosis and Its Role in Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common symptoms of many neurological disorders. The typical excessive, synchronous and aberrant firing of neurons originating from different cerebral areas cause spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures. Prolonged epilepsy can lead to neuronal damage and cell death. The mechanisms underlying epileptic pathogenesis and neuronal death remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of regulated cell death that is characterized by the overload of intracellular iron ions, leading to the accumulation of lethal lipid-based reactive oxygen species (ROS). To date, studies have mainly focused on its role in tumors and various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Current research shows that inhibition of ferroptosis is likely to be an effective therapeutic approach for epilepsy. In this review, we outline the pathogenesis of ferroptosis, regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis, related regulatory molecules, and their effects on epilepsy, providing a new direction for discovering new therapeutic targets in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytic Ca2+ Signaling in Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders – estimated to affect at least 65 million worldwide. Most of the epilepsy research has so far focused on how to dampen neuronal discharges and to explain how changes in intrinsic neuronal activity or network function cause seizures. As a result, pharmacological therapy has largely been limited to symptomatic treatment targeted at neurons. Given the expanding spectrum of functions ascribed to the non-neuronal constituents of the brain, in both physiological brain function and in brain disorders, it is natural to closely consider the roles of astrocytes in epilepsy. It is now widely accepted that astrocytes are key controllers of the composition of the extracellular fluids, and may directly interact with neurons by releasing gliotransmitters. A central tenet is that astrocytic intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals promote release of such signaling substances, either through synaptic or non-synaptic mechanisms. Accruing evidence suggests that astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals play important roles in both seizures and epilepsy, and this review aims to highlight the current knowledge of the roles of this central astrocytic signaling mechanism in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Overexpression of mGluR7 in the Prefrontal Cortex Attenuates Autistic Behaviors in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with a range of abnormalities pertaining to socialization, communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Owing to its complexity, the etiology of ASD remains incompletely understood. The presynaptic G protein-coupled glutamate receptor metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7) is known to be essential for synaptic transmission and is also tightly linked with ASD incidence. Herein, we report that prefrontal cortex (PFC) mGluR7 protein levels were decreased in C57BL/6J mice exposed to valproic acid (VPA) and BTBR T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Itpr3&lt;sup&gt;tf&lt;/sup&gt;/J mice. The overexpression of mGluR7 in the PFC of these mice using a lentiviral vector was sufficient to reduce the severity of ASD-like behavioral patterns such that animals exhibited decreases in abnormal social interactions and communication, anxiety-like, and stereotyped/repetitive behaviors. Intriguingly, patch-clamp recordings revealed that the overexpression of mGluR7 suppressed neuronal excitability by inhibiting action potential discharge frequencies, together with enhanced action potential threshold and increased rheobase. These data offer a scientific basis for the additional study of mGluR7 as a promising therapeutic target in ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Novel Small Molecule Neurotrophin-3 Analogue Promotes Inner Ear Neurite Outgrowth and Synaptogenesis In vitro</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.666706</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss is irreversible and is associated with the loss of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and sensory hair cells within the inner ear. Improving spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis could lead to significant gains for hearing-impaired patients. There has therefore been intense interest in the use of neurotrophic factors in the inner ear to promote both survival of SGNs and re-wiring of sensory hair cells by surviving SGNs. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) represent the primary neurotrophins in the inner ear during development and throughout adulthood, and have demonstrated potential for SGN survival and neurite outgrowth. We have pioneered a hybrid molecule approach to maximize SGN stimulation in vivo, in which small molecule analogues of neurotrophins are linked to bisphosphonates, which in turn bind to cochlear bone. We have previously shown that a small molecule BDNF analogue coupled to risedronate binds to bone matrix and promotes SGN neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in vitro. Because NT-3 has been shown in a variety of contexts to have a greater regenerative capacity in the cochlea than BDNF, we sought to develop a similar approach for NT-3. 1Aa is a small molecule analogue of NT-3 that has been shown to activate cells through TrkC, the NT-3 receptor, although its activity on SGNs has not previously been described. Herein we describe the design and synthesis of 1Aa and a covalent conjugate of 1Aa with risedronate, Ris-1Aa. We demonstrate that both 1Aa and Ris-1Aa stimulate neurite outgrowth in SGN cultures at a significantly higher level compared to controls. Ris-1Aa maintained its neurotrophic activity when bound to hydroxyapatite, the primary mineral component of bone. Both 1Aa and Ris-1Aa promote significant synaptic regeneration in cochlear explant cultures, and both 1Aa and Ris-1Aa appear to act at least partly through TrkC. Our results provide the first evidence that a small molecule analogue of NT-3 can stimulate SGNs and promote regeneration of synapses between SGNs and inner hair cells. Our findings support the promise of hydroxyapatite-targeting bisphosphonate conjugation as a novel strategy to deliver neurotrophic agents to SGNs encased within cochlear bone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Estrogen Deficiency Induces Mitochondrial Damage Prior to Emergence of Cognitive Deficits in a Postmenopausal Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.713819</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.713819</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Estrogen deficiency contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in menopausal women. In the current study, we examined the impact of estrogen deficiency on mitochondrial function and cognition using a postmenopausal mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Bilateral ovariectomy was conducted in adult females C57BL/6J. Cognitive function was examined using the Morris water maze (MWM) test at 2 weeks, 1, 2, and 3 months after ovariectomy. Neurodegeneration was assessed using an immunofluorescence assay of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the hippocampus and immunoblotting against postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95). Mitochondrial function in the hippocampus was assessed using immunoblotting for NDUFB8, SDHB, UQCRC2, MTCO1, and ATP5A1. Mitochondrial biogenesis was examined using immunoblotting for PGC-1α, NRF1, and mtTFA. Mitochondrion fission was assessed with immunoblotting for Drp1, whereas mitochondrion fusion was analyzed with immunoblotting for OPA1 and Mfn2. Mitophagy was examined with immunoblotting for PINK1 and LC3B. Mice receiving sham surgery were used as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ovariectomy resulted in significant learning and memory deficits in the MWM test at 3 months, but not at any earlier time points. At 2 weeks after ovariectomy, levels of Drp1 phosphorylated at Ser637 decreased in the hippocampus. At 1 month after ovariectomy, hippocampal levels of NDUFB8, SDHB, PGC-1α, mtTFA, OPA1, and Mfn2 were significantly reduced. At 2 months after ovariectomy, hippocampal levels of MAP2, PSD95, MTCO1, NRF1, and Pink1 were also reduced. At 3 months, levels of LC3B-II were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The cognitive decline associated with estrogen deficiency is preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis, irregular mitochondrial dynamics, and decreased mitophagy. Thus, mitochondrial damage may contribute to cognitive impairment associated with estrogen deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Management Based on Multimodal Brain Monitoring May Improve Functional Connectivity and Post-operative Neurocognition in Elderly Patients Undergoing Spinal Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.705287</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common condition in elderly patients undergoing surgery. Sedation, analgesia, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and body temperature are known to be associated with PND, but few studies have examined the contribution of these factors combined in detail. This prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study investigated whether anesthesia management based on multimodal brain monitoring—an anesthesia management algorithm designed by our group—could improve the post-operative cognitive function and brain functional connectivity (FC) in elderly patients undergoing elective spinal surgery with general anesthesia. The patients (aged ≥65 years) were randomized into two groups [control (Group C), n = 12 and intervention (Group I), n = 14]. Patients in Group I were managed with multimodal brain monitoring (patient state index, spectral edge frequency, analgesia nociception index, rSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and temperature), and those in Group C were managed with routine anesthesia management. All patients were pre- and post-operatively evaluated (7 days after surgery) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and FC were analyzed after resting-state functional MRI. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipopolysaccharide levels were measured, and the correlation between FC and changes in inflammatory marker levels was analyzed. Mean post-operative MoCA score was higher in Group I (24.80 ± 2.09) than in Group C (22.56 ± 2.24) (p = 0.04), with no difference in PND incidence between groups (28.57 vs. 16.67%; p = 0.47). Group I also showed significantly increased ALFF values in several brain regions after surgery (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and FC between the left hippocampus and left orbital inferior frontal gyrus (FG), left middle FG, left superior temporal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus was enhanced (p &amp;lt; 0.05), which was negatively correlated with the change in serum CRP (pre vs. post-intervention) (R = −0.58, p = 0.01). These results suggest that management of elderly patients undergoing surgery by multimodal brain monitoring may improve post-operative neurocognition and FC by reducing systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx, identifier: ChiCTR1900028024.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial autophagy is an early defense and protection process that selectively clears dysfunctional or excessive mitochondria through a distinctive mechanism to maintain intracellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction during cerebral stroke involves metabolic disbalance, oxidative stress, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and abnormal mitochondrial autophagy. This article reviews the research progress on the mechanism of mitochondrial autophagy in ischemic stroke to provide a theoretical basis for further research on mitochondrial autophagy and the treatment of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: RNF213 p.R4810K (c.14429G &gt; A) Variant Determines Anatomical Variations of the Circle of Willis in Cerebrovascular Disease</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of the RING finger protein 213 (RNF213) gene impairs vascular formation in experimental animal models. In addition, vascular abnormalities in the circle of Willis are associated with cerebrovascular disease. Here, we evaluated the relationship between the East Asian founder variant RNF213 p.R4810K and consequent anatomical variations in the circle of Willis in cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;Patients and Methods&lt;p&gt;The present study is an observational cross-sectional study. It included patients with acute anterior circulation non-cardioembolic stroke admitted to our institution within 7 days of symptom onset or last-known-well from 2011 to 2019, and those who participated in the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Biobank. We compared anatomical variations of the vessels constituting the circle of Willis between RNF213 p.R4810K (c.14429G &amp;gt; A) variant carriers and non-carriers using magnetic resonance angiography and assessed the association between the variants and the presence of the vessels constituting the circle of Willis. Patients with moyamoya disease were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Four hundred eighty-one patients [146 women (30%); median age 70 years; median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 5] were analyzed. The RNF213 p.R4810K variant carriers (n = 25) were more likely to have both posterior communicating arteries (PComAs) than the variant non-carriers (n = 456) (56% vs. 13%, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Furthermore, variant carriers were less likely to have an anterior communicating artery (AComA) than non-carriers (68% vs. 84%, P = 0.04). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the association of RNF213 p.R4810K variant carriers with the presence of both PComAs and the absence of AComA remained significant.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the RNF213 p.R4810K variant is an important factor in determining anatomical variations in the circle of Willis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Cryo-EM structures of the caspase activated protein XKR9 involved in apoptotic lipid scrambling</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69800</link>
	<description>The exposure of the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine on the cell-surface, catalyzed by lipid scramblases, is an important signal for the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. The protein XKR9 is a member of a conserved family that has been associated with apoptotic lipid scrambling. Here, we describe structures of full-length and caspase-treated XKR9 from &lt;i&gt;Rattus norvegicus&lt;/i&gt; in complex with a synthetic nanobody determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The 43 kDa monomeric membrane protein can be divided into two structurally related repeats, each containing four membrane-spanning segments and a helix that is partly inserted into the lipid bilayer. In the full-length protein, the C-terminus interacts with a hydrophobic pocket located at the intracellular side acting as an inhibitor of protein function. Cleavage by caspase-3 at a specific site releases 16 residues of the C-terminus thus making the pocket accessible to the cytoplasm. Collectively, the work has revealed the unknown architecture of the XKR family and has provided initial insight into its activation by caspases.</description>

	<title>eLife: A plant-like mechanism coupling m6A reading to polyadenylation safeguards transcriptome integrity and developmental gene partitioning in Toxoplasma</title>

	<description>Correct 3'end processing of mRNAs is one of the regulatory cornerstones of gene expression. In a parasite that must adapt to the regulatory requirements of its multi-host life style, there is a need to adopt additional means to partition the distinct transcriptional signatures of the closely and tandemly-arranged stage specific genes. In this study, we report our findings in &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; of an m6A-dependent 3'end polyadenylation serving as a transcriptional barrier at these &lt;i&gt;loci&lt;/i&gt;. We identify the core polyadenylation complex within &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; and establish CPSF4 as a reader for m6A-modified mRNAs, via a YTH domain within its C-terminus, a feature which is shared with plants. We bring evidence of the specificity of this interaction both biochemically, and by determining the crystal structure at high resolution of the &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; CPSF4-YTH in complex with an m6A modified RNA. We show that the loss of m6A, both at the level of its deposition or its recognition was associated with an increase in aberrantly elongated chimeric mRNAs emanating from impaired transcriptional termination, a phenotype previously noticed in the plant model &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing shows the occurrence of transcriptional read-through breaching into downstream repressed stage-specific genes, in the absence of either CPSF4 or the m6A RNA methylase components in both &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. Taken together, our results shed light on an essential regulatory mechanism coupling the pathways of m6A metabolism directly to the cleavage and polyadenylation processes, one that interestingly seem to serve, in both &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, as a guardian against aberrant transcriptional read-throughs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Functional development of a V3/glycan-specific broadly neutralizing antibody isolated from a case of HIV superinfection</title>

	<description>Stimulating broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) directly from germline remains a barrier for HIV vaccines. HIV superinfection elicits bnAbs more frequently than single infection, providing clues of how to elicit such responses. We used longitudinal antibody sequencing and structural studies to characterize bnAb development from a superinfection case. BnAb QA013.2 bound initial and superinfecting viral Env, despite its probable naïve progenitor only recognizing the superinfecting strain, suggesting both viruses influenced this lineage. A 4.15 Å cryo-EM structure of QA013.2 bound to native-like trimer showed recognition of V3 signatures (N301/N332 and GDIR). QA013.2 relies less on CDRH3 and more on framework and CDRH1 for affinity and breadth compared to other V3/glycan-specific bnAbs. Antigenic profiling revealed that viral escape was achieved by changes in the structurally-defined epitope and by mutations in V1. These results highlight shared and novel properties of QA013.2 relative to other V3/glycan-specific bnAbs in the setting of sequential, diverse antigens.</description>

	<title>eLife: Functional interdependence of the actin nucleator Cobl and Cobl-like in dendritic arbor development</title>

	<description>Local actin filament formation is indispensable for development of the dendritic arbor of neurons. We show that, surprisingly, the action of single actin filament-promoting factors was insufficient for powering dendritogenesis. Instead, this required the actin nucleator Cobl and its only evolutionary distant ancestor Cobl-like acting interdependently. This coordination between Cobl-like and Cobl was achieved by physical linkage by syndapins. Syndapin I formed nanodomains at convex plasma membrane areas at the base of protrusive structures and interacted with three motifs in Cobl-like, one of which was Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-regulated. Consistently, syndapin I, Cobl-like’s newly identified N terminal calmodulin-binding site and the single Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-responsive syndapin-binding motif all were critical for Cobl-like’s functions. In dendritic arbor development, local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM-controlled actin dynamics thus relies on regulated and physically coordinated interactions of different F-actin formation-promoting factors and only together they have the power to bring about the sophisticated neuronal morphologies required for neuronal network formation in mammals.</description>

	<title>eLife: Rapid spread of a densovirus in a major crop pest following wide-scale adoption of Bt-cotton in China</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66913</link>
	<description>&lt;i&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis &lt;/i&gt;(Bt) crops have been widely planted and the effects of Bt-crops on populations of the target and non-target insect pests have been well studied. However, the effects of Bt-crops exposure on microorganisms that interact with crop pests have not previously been quantified. Here, we use laboratory and field data to show that infection of &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt; with a densovirus (HaDV2) is associated with its enhanced growth and tolerance to Bt-cotton. Moreover, field monitoring showed a much higher incidence of cotton bollworm infection with HaDV2 in regions cultivated with Bt-cotton than in regions without it, with the rate of densovirus infection increasing with increasing use of Bt-cotton. RNA-seq suggested tolerance to both baculovirus and Cry1Ac were enhanced via the immune-related pathways. These findings suggest that exposure to Bt-crops has selected for beneficial interactions between the target pest and a mutualistic microorganism that enhances its performance on Bt-crops under field conditions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Non-canonical H3K79me2-dependent pathways promote the survival of MLL-rearranged leukemia</title>

	<description>MLL-rearranged leukemia depends on H3K79 methylation. Depletion of this transcriptionally-activating mark by DOT1L deletion or high concentrations of the inhibitor pinometostat downregulates &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEIS1&lt;/i&gt;, and consequently reduces leukemia survival. Yet some MLL-rearranged leukemias are inexplicably susceptible to low-dose pinometostat, far below concentrations that downregulate this canonical proliferation pathway. In this context, we define alternative proliferation pathways that more directly derive from H3K79me2 loss. By ICeChIP-seq, H3K79me2 is markedly depleted at pinometostat-downregulated and MLL-fusion targets, with paradoxical increases of H3K4me3 and loss of H3K27me3. Although downregulation of polycomb components accounts for some of the proliferation defect, transcriptional downregulation of FLT3 is the major pathway. Loss-of-FLT3-function recapitulates the cytotoxicity and gene expression consequences of low-dose pinometostat, whereas overexpression of constitutively active &lt;i&gt;STAT5A&lt;/i&gt;, a target of FLT3-ITD-signalling, largely rescues these defects. This pathway also depends on MLL1, indicating combinations of DOT1L, MLL1 and FLT3 inhibitors should be explored for treating &lt;i&gt;FLT3-&lt;/i&gt;mutant leukemia.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alpha oscillations and event related potentials reflect distinct dynamics of attribute construction and evidence accumulation in dietary decision making</title>

	<description>How does regulatory focus alter attribute value construction (AVC) and evidence accumulation (EA)? We recorded EEG during food choices while participants responded naturally or regulated their choices by attending to health attributes or decreasing attention to taste attributes. Using a drift diffusion model, we predicted the time course of neural signals associated with AVC and EA. Results suggested that event-related-potentials (ERPs) correlated with the time course of model-predicted taste-attribute signals, with no modulation by regulation. By contrast, suppression of frontal and occipital alpha power correlated with the time course of EA, tracked tastiness according to its goal relevance, and predicted individual variation in successful down-regulation of tastiness. Additionally, an earlier rise in frontal and occipital theta power represented food tastiness more strongly during regulation, and predicted a weaker influence of food tastiness on behaviour. Our findings illuminate how regulation modifies the representation of attributes during the process of evidence accumulation.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Toll‐like receptor 10 controls TLR2‐induced cytokine production in monocytes from patients with Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24916</guid>

	<description>Parkinson's disease (PD) patients present higher frequency of intermediate monocytes expressing TLR10. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2‐induced cytokine production.

Abstract
Peripheral inflammation, particularly mediated by monocytes, can cause neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the mechanism of TLR2‐induced cytokine impairment in peripheral monocytes from PD patients and the association between the presence of CD14+TLR10+ monocytes and PD severity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients and healthy individuals were evaluated for TLR expression on monocyte subsets (CD14 and CD16 expression) using flow cytometry. Moreover, cytokines were evaluated using flow cytometry after stimulation with Pam3Cys (TLR2/TLR1 agonist) in the absence or presence of neutralizing antibodies to TLR10. The severity of PD was assessed using the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) and motor activity, anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and fatigue (PD Fatigue Scale‐16) scales. The frequency of CD14+TLR10+ monocytes and expression intensity of TLR2 and TLR10 were higher in patients with PD than healthy individuals. The frequency of intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+) was not significantly increased in patients with PD, but was the main monocyte subset expressing TLR10. The TLR2/TLR1‐impaired cytokine production (IL‐6, TNFα, IL‐8, and IL‐10) in PD patients was reversed by neutralizing TLR10. The high frequency of total CD14+TLR10+ monocytes was associated with a reduction in the severity of PD according to the evaluation of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Peripheral monocytes from patients with PD showed phenotypic and functional alterations. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2‐induced cytokine production. Furthermore, data suggested that a low frequency of CD14+TLR10+ monocytes indicates the severity of PD. The results identified new opportunities for the development of novel PD neuroprotective therapies.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genome‐Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci for Cluster Headache</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26150</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26150?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to identify susceptibility loci for cluster headache and obtain insights into relevant disease pathways.


Methods
We carried out a genome‐wide association study, where 852 UK and 591 Swedish cluster headache cases were compared with 5,614 and 1,134 controls, respectively. Following quality control and imputation, single variant association testing was conducted using a logistic mixed model for each cohort. The 2 cohorts were subsequently combined in a merged analysis. Downstream analyses, such as gene‐set enrichment, functional variant annotation, prediction and pathway analyses, were performed.


Results
Initial independent analysis identified 2 replicable cluster headache susceptibility loci on chromosome 2. A merged analysis identified an additional locus on chromosome 1 and confirmed a locus significant in the UK analysis on chromosome 6, which overlaps with a previously known migraine locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were rs113658130 (p = 1.92 × 10−17, odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37–1.66) and rs4519530 (p = 6.98 × 10−17, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.34–1.61) on chromosome 2, rs12121134 on chromosome 1 (p = 1.66 × 10−8, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.22–1.52), and rs11153082 (p = 1.85 × 10−8, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.19–1.42) on chromosome 6. Downstream analyses implicated immunological processes in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.


Interpretation
We identified and replicated several genome‐wide significant associations supporting a genetic predisposition in cluster headache in a genome‐wide association study involving 1,443 cases. Replication in larger independent cohorts combined with comprehensive phenotyping, in relation to, for example, treatment response and cluster headache subtypes, could provide unprecedented insights into genotype–phenotype correlations and the pathophysiological pathways underlying cluster headache.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It was quickly established that both the symptoms and the disease severity may vary from one case to another and several strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. To gain a better understanding of the wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 strains and their associated symptoms, thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced in dozens of countries. In this article, we introduce COVIDomic, a multi-omics online platform designed to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the large amount of health data collected from patients with COVID-19. The COVIDomic platform provides a comprehensive set of bioinformatic tools for the multi-modal metatranscriptomic data analysis of COVID-19 patients to determine the origin of the coronavirus strain and the expected severity of the disease. An integrative analytical workflow, which includes microbial pathogens community analysis, COVID-19 genetic epidemiology and patient stratification, allows to analyze the presence of the most common microbial organisms, their antibiotic resistance, the severity of the infection and the set of the most probable geographical locations from which the studied strain could have originated. The online platform integrates a user friendly interface which allows easy visualization of the results. We envision this tool will not only have immediate implications for management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but will also improve our readiness to respond to other infectious outbreaks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aRubFGCY5Cw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: On the influence of prior information evaluated by fully Bayesian criteria in a personalized whole-brain model of epilepsy spread</title>

Individualized anatomical information has been used as prior knowledge in Bayesian inference paradigms of whole-brain network models. However, the actual sensitivity to such personalized information in priors is still unknown. In this study, we introduce the use of fully Bayesian information criteria and leave-one-out cross-validation technique on the subject-specific information to assess different epileptogenicity hypotheses regarding the location of pathological brain areas based on a priori knowledge from dynamical system properties. The Bayesian Virtual Epileptic Patient (BVEP) model, which relies on the fusion of structural data of individuals, a generative model of epileptiform discharges, and a self-tuning Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, is used to infer the spatial map of epileptogenicity across different brain areas. Our results indicate that measuring the out-of-sample prediction accuracy of the BVEP model with informative priors enables reliable and efficient evaluation of potential hypotheses regarding the degree of epileptogenicity across different brain regions. In contrast, while using uninformative priors, the information criteria are unable to provide strong evidence about the epileptogenicity of brain areas. We also show that the fully Bayesian criteria correctly assess different hypotheses about both structural and functional components of whole-brain models that differ across individuals. The fully Bayesian information-theory based approach used in this study suggests a patient-specific strategy for epileptogenicity hypothesis testing in generative brain network models of epilepsy to improve surgical outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HyXFmV4yg94&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During the last decade, a consensus has emerged that the stochastic triggering of an excitable system drives pseudopod formation and subsequent migration of amoeboid cells. The presence of chemoattractant stimuli alters the threshold for triggering this activity and can bias the direction of migration. Though noise plays an important role in these behaviors, mathematical models have typically ignored its origin and merely introduced it as an external signal into a series of reaction-diffusion equations. Here we consider a more realistic description based on a reaction-diffusion master equation formalism to implement these networks. In this scheme, noise arises naturally from a stochastic description of the various reaction and diffusion terms. Working on a three-dimensional geometry in which separate compartments are divided into a tetrahedral mesh, we implement a modular description of the system, consisting of G-protein coupled receptor signaling (GPCR), a local excitation-global inhibition mechanism (LEGI), and signal transduction excitable network (STEN). Our models implement detailed biochemical descriptions whenever this information is available, such as in the GPCR and G-protein interactions. In contrast, where the biochemical entities are less certain, such as the LEGI mechanism, we consider various possible schemes and highlight the differences between them. Our stimulations show that even when the LEGI mechanism displays perfect adaptation in terms of the mean level of proteins, the variance shows a dose-dependence. This differs between the various models considered, suggesting a possible means for determining experimentally among the various potential networks. Overall, our simulations recreate temporal and spatial patterns observed experimentally in both wild-type and perturbed cells, providing further evidence for the excitable system paradigm. Moreover, because of the overall importance and ubiquity of the modules we consider, including GPCR signaling and adaptation, our results will be of interest beyond the field of directed migration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UWwAEhrOslA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) are mutualistic interactions formed between soil fungi and plant roots. AM symbiosis is a fundamental and widespread trait in plants with the potential to sustainably enhance future crop yields. However, improving AM fungal association in crop species requires a fundamental understanding of host colonisation dynamics across varying agronomic and ecological contexts. To this end, we demonstrate the use of betalain pigments as in vivo visual markers for the occurrence and distribution of AM fungal colonisation by &lt;i&gt;Rhizophagus irregularis&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; roots. Using established and novel AM-responsive promoters, we assembled multigene reporter constructs that enable the AM-controlled expression of the core betalain synthesis genes. We show that betalain colouration is specifically induced in root tissues and cells where fungal colonisation has occurred. In a rhizotron setup, we also demonstrate that betalain staining allows for the noninvasive tracing of fungal colonisation along the root system over time. We present MycoRed, a useful innovative method that will expand and complement currently used fungal visualisation techniques to advance knowledge in the field of AM symbiosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4_Ck3iMJ2Do&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
The events of 2020, including the pandemic which highlighted the extent of health disparities in the United States, combined with the Black Lives Matter protests, have focused public attention on the systemic inequities that continue to afflict our nation. Publicly available data from the National Center for Education Statistics show that our discipline of neuroscience shows the same types of disparities, particularly for African‐American students. I have drawn on data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Survey of U.S. colleges and universities to show that while the number of graduates from neuroscience undergraduate and graduate degree programs has grown dramatically in this century, only a small percentage of those graduates are African American, and the numbers are growing very slowly. I also present data on the neuroscience PhD program at my institution, Delaware State University, the only Historically Black University in the United States to offer a PhD in neuroscience. Because a high percentage of our students and graduates are African American, our small, young program has the potential for great impact in diversifying our discipline of neuroscience. While elite colleges and research‐intensive universities have been engaged for decades in efforts to increase diversity in their academic programs, change is slow, and large inequities remain. With Delaware State University's neuroscience PhD program as an example, I hope to convince readers that it is time for our nation to recognize the institutions that are best positioned to serve students from communities of color, and direct resources to support their growth and success.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Astrocytes play essential roles in development, homeostasis, injury, and repair of the central nervous system (CNS). Their development is tightly regulated by distinct spatial and temporal cues during embryogenesis and into adulthood throughout the CNS. Astrocytes have several important responsibilities such as regulating blood flow and permeability of the blood‐CNS barrier, glucose metabolism and storage, synapse formation and function, and axon myelination. In CNS pathologies, astrocytes also play critical parts in both injury and repair mechanisms. Upon injury, they undergo a robust phenotypic shift known as “reactive astrogliosis,” which results in both constructive and deleterious outcomes. Astrocyte activation and migration at the site of injury provides an early defense mechanism to minimize the extent of injury by enveloping the lesion area. However, astrogliosis also contributes to the inhibitory microenvironment of CNS injury and potentiate secondary injury mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity, which facilitate neurodegeneration in CNS pathologies. Intriguingly, reactive astrocytes are increasingly a focus in current therapeutic strategies as their activation can be modulated toward a neuroprotective and reparative phenotype. This review will discuss recent advancements in knowledge regarding the development and role of astrocytes in the healthy and pathological CNS. We will also review how astrocytes have been genetically modified to optimize their reparative potential after injury, and how they may be transdifferentiated into neurons and oligodendrocytes to promote repair after CNS injury and neurodegeneration.</description>

	<description>Immunohistochemical staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) reveals the subcortical white matter neurons, or white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), deep to the grey matter of the parietal neocortex in the brain of a squirrel monkey. GM – grey matter, WM – white matter, dashed line indicates the approximate GM/WM border.






Abstract
In the current study we examined the number, distribution, and aspects of the neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), in the brains of a southern lesser galago (Galago moholi), a black‐capped squirrel monkey (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis) and a crested macaque (Macaca nigra). Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most dense close to inner cortical border, decreasing in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN‐immunopositive cells revealed estimates of approximately 1.1 million, 10.8 million, and 37.7 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the galago, squirrel monkey and crested macaque, respectively. The total numbers of WMICs form a distinct negative allometric relationship with brain mass and white matter volume when examined in a larger sample of primates where similar measures have been obtained. In all three primates studied, the highest densities of WMICs were in the white matter of the frontal lobe, with the occipital lobe having the lowest. Immunostaining revealed significant subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calretinin, with very few WMICs containing parvalbumin, and none containing calbindin. The nNOS and calretinin immunopositive WMICs, represent approximately 21% of the total WMIC population; however, variances in the proportions of these neurochemical phenotypes were noted. Our results indicate that both the squirrel monkey and crested macaque might be informative animal models for the study of WMICs in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders in humans.

	<description>Abstract
In 1994, Burrill and Easter described the retinal projections in embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term “arborization fields” (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital Max Planck Zebrafish Brain Atlas. In our system, individual AFs are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei; AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation, and activation experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the synergy created by merging classical neuroanatomy with a cellular‐resolution digital brain atlas resource and functional imaging in larval zebrafish.</description>

	<description>Objective
Identifying common genetic variants that confer genetic risk for cluster headache.


Methods
We conducted a case–control study in the Dutch Leiden University Cluster headache neuro‐Analysis program (LUCA) study population (n = 840) and unselected controls from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study (NEO; n = 1,457). Replication was performed in a Norwegian sample of 144 cases from the Trondheim Cluster headache sample and 1,800 controls from the Nord‐Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, blood cell‐derived RNA‐sequencing of genes around the risk loci and linkage disequilibrium score regression were part of the downstream analyses.


Results
An association was found with cluster headache for 4 independent loci (r2 &amp;lt; 0.1) with genomewide significance (p &amp;lt; 5 × 10−8), rs11579212 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33–1.72 near RP11‐815 M8.1), rs6541998 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.37–1.74 near MERTK), rs10184573 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.26–1.61 near AC093590.1), and rs2499799 (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.54–0.73 near UFL1/FHL5), collectively explaining 7.2% of the variance of cluster headache. SNPs rs11579212, rs10184573, and rs976357, as proxy SNP for rs2499799 (r2 = 1.0), replicated in the Norwegian sample (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Gene‐based mapping yielded ASZ1 as possible fifth locus. RNA‐sequencing indicated differential expression of POLR1B and TMEM87B in cluster headache patients.


Interpretation
This genomewide association study (GWAS) identified and replicated genetic risk loci for cluster headaches with effect sizes larger than those typically seen in complex genetic disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Sex Differences in the Ventral Tegmental Area and Nucleus Accumbens Proteome at Baseline and Following Nicotine Exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.657064</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sex differences in behaviors relevant to nicotine addiction have been observed in rodent models and human subjects. Behavioral, imaging, and epidemiological studies also suggest underlying sex differences in mesolimbic dopamine signaling pathways. In this study we evaluated the proteome in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in male and female mice. Experimental groups included two mouse strains (C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J) at baseline, a sub-chronic, rewarding regimen of nicotine in C3H/HeJ mice, and chronic nicotine administration and withdrawal in C57BL/6J mice. Isobaric labeling with a TMT 10-plex system, sample fractionation, and tandem mass spectrometry were used to quantify changes in protein abundance. In C3H/HeJ mice, similar numbers of proteins were differentially regulated between sexes at baseline compared with within each sex after sub-chronic nicotine administration. In C57BL/6J mice, there were significantly greater numbers of proteins differentially regulated between sexes at baseline compared with within each sex after chronic nicotine administration and withdrawal. Despite differences by sex, strain, and nicotine exposure parameters, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32, Ppp1r1b) were repeatedly identified as significantly altered proteins, especially in the VTA. Further, network analyses showed sex- and nicotine-dependent regulation of a number of signaling pathways, including dopaminergic signaling. Sub-chronic nicotine exposure in female mice increased proteins related to dopaminergic signaling in the NAc shell but decreased them in the VTA, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in male mice. In contrast, dopaminergic signaling pathways were similarly upregulated in both male and female VTA after chronic nicotine and withdrawal. Overall, this study identifies significant sex differences in the proteome of the mesolimbic system, at baseline and after nicotine reward or withdrawal, which may help explain differential trajectories and susceptibility to nicotine addiction in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Cognitive Impairment and the Brain Lipidome in a Cuprizone-Induced Mouse Model of Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.706786</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.706786</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The protective effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on myelin integrity have been extensively studied, and growing evidence suggests that rTMS is beneficial in improving cognitive functions and promoting myelin repair. However, the association between cognitive improvement due to rTMS and changes in brain lipids remains elusive. In this study, we used the Y-maze and 3-chamber tests, as well as a mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach in a CPZ-induced demyelination model in mice to assess the protective effects of rTMS on cuprizone (CPZ)-induced cognitive impairment and evaluate changes in lipid composition in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum. We found that CPZ induced cognitive impairment and remarkable changes in brain lipids, specifically in glycerophospholipids. Moreover, the changes in lipids within the prefrontal cortex were more extensive, compared to those observed in the hippocampus and striatum. Notably, rTMS ameliorated CPZ-induced cognitive impairment and partially normalized CPZ-induced lipid changes. Taken together, our data suggest that rTMS may reverse cognitive behavioral changes caused by CPZ-induced demyelination by modulating the brain lipidome, providing new insights into the therapeutic mechanism of rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mapping Knowledge Structure and Research Frontiers of Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening: A Scientometric Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.706105</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.706105</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Among the effective approaches developed for blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, ultrasound is recognized as a non-invasive technique that can induce localized BBB opening transiently and repeatedly. This technique has aroused broad attention from researchers worldwide, and numerous articles have been published recently. However, no existing study has systematically examined this field from a scientometric perspective. The aim of this study was to summarize the knowledge structure and identify emerging trends and potential hotspots in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Publications related to ultrasound-induced BBB opening published from 1998 to 2020 were retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection. The search strategies were as follows: topic: (“blood brain barrier” OR “BBB”) AND topic: (ultrasound OR ultrason* OR acoustic* OR sonopora*). The document type was set to articles or reviews with language restriction to English. Three different analysis tools including one online platform, VOS viewer1.6.16, and CiteSpace V5.7.R2 software were used to conduct this scientometric study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 1,201 valid records were included in the final analysis. The majority of scientific publication was produced by authors from North America, Eastern Asia, and Western Europe. Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology was the most prominent journal. The USA, China, and Canada were the most productive countries. Hynynen K, and Mcdannold N were key researchers with considerable academic influence. According to analysis of keywords, four main research directions were identified: cluster 1 (microbubbles study), cluster 2 (management of intracranial tumors), cluster 3 (ultrasound parameters and mechanisms study), and cluster 4 (treatment of neurodegenerative diseases). The current research hotspot has shifted from the basic research of ultrasound and microbubbles to management of intracranial tumors and neurodegenerative diseases. Burst detection analysis showed that Parkinson's disease, doxorubicin, gold nanoparticle, glioblastoma, gene therapy, and Alzheimer's disease may continue to be the research frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Ultrasound-induced BBB opening research is in a period of robust development. This study is a starting point, providing a comprehensive overview, development landscape, and future opportunities of this technology, which standout as a useful reference for researchers and decision makers interested in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Changes in Resting-State Spontaneous Brain Activity in Patients With Allergic Rhinitis: A Pilot Neuroimaging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697299</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697299</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory disorder of the nose caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immune response to allergens. Apart from the typical symptoms of sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion, behavioral complications were also reported to be associated with the progression of AR, such as cognitive deficits, mood changes, memory decline, attention deficiency, poor school performance, anxiety, and depression. Recent human studies have suggested that alterations in brain function caused by allergen exposure may precipitate high levels of anxiety and emotional reactivity in asthma patients. But until now, there is no direct evidence of the relationship between brain activity and allergic rhinitis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to excavate whether there remain functional changes of brain activity in AR patients. We measured the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and the z conversion of ALFF (zALFF) in 20 patients with AR and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) using the rs-fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with healthy controls, AR patients exhibited lower ALFF values in the precuneus (PCUN) and higher ALFF values in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ALFF values of these features were significantly correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) scores, the subscales of RQLQ, and specific IgE, partly.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found changes in resting-state spontaneous brain activity in AR patients with hypoactivity in the PCUN and hyperactivity of the ACC. The brain-related symptoms of AR might be another potential clinical intervention target for improving the life quality of AR patients. Further attention to brain activity is essential for a deeper understanding of AR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Topological Properties of Static/Dynamic Functional Networks and Cognitive Function After Radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Using Resting-State fMRI</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to (1) explore the changes in topological properties of static and dynamic brain functional networks after nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT) using rs-fMRI and graph theoretical analysis, (2) explore the correlation between cognitive function and changes in brain function, and (3) add to the understanding of the pathogenesis of radiation brain injury (RBI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four patients were divided into 3 groups according to time after RT: PT1 (0–6 months); PT2 (&amp;gt;6 to ≤12 months); and PT3 (&amp;gt;12 months). 29 normal controls (NCs) were included. The subjects’ topological properties were evaluated by graph-theoretic network analysis, the functional connectivity of static functional networks was calculated using network-based statistics, and the dynamic functional network matrix was subjected to cluster analysis. Finally, correlation analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between the altered network parameters and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Assortativity, hierarchy, and network efficiency were significantly abnormal in the PT1 group compared with the NC or PT3 group. The small-world variance in the PT3 group was smaller than that in NCs. The Nodal ClustCoeff of Postcentral_R in the PT2 group was significantly smaller than that in PT3 and NC groups. Functional connectivities were significantly reduced in the patient groups. Most of the functional connectivities of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) were shown to be significantly reduced in all three patient groups. Most of the functional connectivities of the insula showed significantly reduced in the PT1 and PT3 groups, and most of the functional connectivities in brain regions such as frontal and parietal lobes showed significantly reduced in the PT2 and PT3 groups. These abnormal functional connectivities were correlated with scores on multiple scales that primarily assessed memory, executive ability, and overall cognitive function. The frequency F of occurrence of various states in each subject differed significantly, and the interaction effect of group and state was significant.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The disruption of static and dynamic functional network stability, reduced network efficiency and reduced functional connectivity may be potential biomarkers of RBI. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RBI from the perspective of functional networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Study of Human Tacit Knowledge Based on Electroencephalogram Signal Characteristics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tacit knowledge is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. In the mineral grinding process, the proficiency of the operators depends on the tacit knowledge gained from their experience and training rather than on knowledge learned from a handbook. This article proposed a method combining the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and the industrial process to detect the proficiency of the operators in the mineral grinding process to reveal the effect of tacit knowledge on the functional cortical connection. The functional brain networks of operators were established based on partial direct coherence and directed transfer function of EEG, and the multi-classifiers were used with the graph-theoretic indexes of the FBNs as input to distinguish the trained operators (Hps) from the non-trained operators (Lps). The results showed that the brain networks of Hps had a better connectivity than those of Lps (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and the accuracy of classification was up to 94.2%. Our studies confirm that based on the performance of EEG features and the combination of industrial operational operation and cognitive processes, the proficiency of the operators can be detected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Dual-Threshold-Based Microstate Analysis on Characterizing Temporal Dynamics of Affective Process and Emotion Recognition From EEG Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689791</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, emotion classification from electroencephalogram (EEG) data has attracted much attention. As EEG is an unsteady and rapidly changing voltage signal, the features extracted from EEG usually change dramatically, whereas emotion states change gradually. Most existing feature extraction approaches do not consider these differences between EEG and emotion. Microstate analysis could capture important spatio-temporal properties of EEG signals. At the same time, it could reduce the fast-changing EEG signals to a sequence of prototypical topographical maps. While microstate analysis has been widely used to study brain function, few studies have used this method to analyze how brain responds to emotional auditory stimuli. In this study, the authors proposed a novel feature extraction method based on EEG microstates for emotion recognition. Determining the optimal number of microstates automatically is a challenge for applying microstate analysis to emotion. This research proposed dual-threshold-based atomize and agglomerate hierarchical clustering (DTAAHC) to determine the optimal number of microstate classes automatically. By using the proposed method to model the temporal dynamics of auditory emotion process, we extracted microstate characteristics as novel temporospatial features to improve the performance of emotion recognition from EEG signals. We evaluated the proposed method on two datasets. For public music-evoked EEG Dataset for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals, the microstate analysis identified 10 microstates which together explained around 86% of the data in global field power peaks. The accuracy of emotion recognition achieved 75.8% in valence and 77.1% in arousal using microstate sequence characteristics as features. Compared to previous studies, the proposed method outperformed the current feature sets. For the speech-evoked EEG dataset, the microstate analysis identified nine microstates which together explained around 85% of the data. The accuracy of emotion recognition achieved 74.2% in valence and 72.3% in arousal using microstate sequence characteristics as features. The experimental results indicated that microstate characteristics can effectively improve the performance of emotion recognition from EEG signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Synaptic Plasticity in Memristive Artificial Synapses and Their Robustness Against Noisy Inputs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging brain-inspired neuromorphic computing paradigms require devices that can emulate the complete functionality of biological synapses upon different neuronal activities in order to process big data flows in an efficient and cognitive manner while being robust against any noisy input. The memristive device has been proposed as a promising candidate for emulating artificial synapses due to their complex multilevel and dynamical plastic behaviors. In this work, we exploit ultrastable analog BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BFO)-based memristive devices for experimentally demonstrating that BFO artificial synapses support various long-term plastic functions, i.e., spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), cycle number-dependent plasticity (CNDP), and spiking rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP). The study on the impact of electrical stimuli in terms of pulse width and amplitude on STDP behaviors shows that their learning windows possess a wide range of timescale configurability, which can be a function of applied waveform. Moreover, beyond SRDP, the systematical and comparative study on generalized frequency-dependent plasticity (FDP) is carried out, which reveals for the first time that the ratio modulation between pulse width and pulse interval time within one spike cycle can result in both synaptic potentiation and depression effect within the same firing frequency. The impact of intrinsic neuronal noise on the STDP function of a single BFO artificial synapse can be neglected because thermal noise is two orders of magnitude smaller than the writing voltage and because the cycle-to-cycle variation of the current–voltage characteristics of a single BFO artificial synapses is small. However, extrinsic voltage fluctuations, e.g., in neural networks, cause a noisy input into the artificial synapses of the neural network. Here, the impact of extrinsic neuronal noise on the STDP function of a single BFO artificial synapse is analyzed in order to understand the robustness of plastic behavior in memristive artificial synapses against extrinsic noisy input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NIRS-ICA: A MATLAB Toolbox for Independent Component Analysis Applied in fNIRS Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.683735</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Independent component analysis (ICA) is a multivariate approach that has been widely used in analyzing brain imaging data. In the field of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), its promising effectiveness has been shown in both removing noise and extracting neuronal activity-related sources. The application of ICA remains challenging due to its complexity in usage, and an easy-to-use toolbox dedicated to ICA processing is still lacking in the fNIRS community. In this study, we propose NIRS-ICA, an open-source MATLAB toolbox to ease the difficulty of ICA application for fNIRS studies. NIRS-ICA incorporates commonly used ICA algorithms for source separation, user-friendly GUI, and quantitative evaluation metrics assisting source selection, which facilitate both removing noise and extracting neuronal activity-related sources. The options used in the processing can also be reported easily, which promotes using ICA in a more reproducible way. The proposed toolbox is validated and demonstrated based on both simulative and real fNIRS datasets. We expect the release of the toolbox will extent the application for ICA in the fNIRS community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain-Computer Interfaces for Children With Complex Communication Needs and Limited Mobility: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.643294</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent a new frontier in the effort to maximize the ability of individuals with profound motor impairments to interact and communicate. While much literature points to BCIs' promise as an alternative access pathway, there have historically been few applications involving children and young adults with severe physical disabilities. As research is emerging in this sphere, this article aims to evaluate the current state of translating BCIs to the pediatric population. A systematic review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, and Ovid Medline databases. Studies of children and adolescents that reported BCI performance published in English in peer-reviewed journals between 2008 and May 2020 were included. Twelve publications were identified, providing strong evidence for continued research in pediatric BCIs. Research evidence was generally at multiple case study or exploratory study level, with modest sample sizes. Seven studies focused on BCIs for communication and five on mobility. Articles were categorized and grouped based on type of measurement (i.e., non-invasive and invasive), and the type of brain signal (i.e., sensory evoked potentials or movement-related potentials). Strengths and limitations of studies were identified and used to provide requirements for clinical translation of pediatric BCIs. This systematic review presents the state-of-the-art of pediatric BCIs focused on developing advanced technology to support children and youth with communication disabilities or limited manual ability. Despite a few research studies addressing the application of BCIs for communication and mobility in children, results are encouraging and future works should focus on customizable pediatric access technologies based on brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Kinesthetic Contribution to Motor Imagery of Body Parts: Tongue, Hands, and Feet</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.602723</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery (MI) is assimilated to a perception-action process, which is mentally represented. Although several models suggest that MI, and its equivalent motor execution, engage very similar brain areas, the mechanisms underlying MI and their associated components are still under investigation today. Using 22 Ag/AgCl EEG electrodes, 19 healthy participants (nine males and 10 females) with an average age of 25.8 years old (sd = 3.5 years) were required to imagine moving several parts of their body (i.e., first-person perspective) one by one: left and right hand, tongue, and feet. Network connectivity analysis based on graph theory, together with a correlational analysis, were performed on the data. The findings suggest evidence for motor and somesthetic neural synchronization and underline the role of the parietofrontal network for the tongue imagery task only. At both unilateral and bilateral cortical levels, only the tongue imagery task appears to be associated with motor and somatosensory representations, that is, kinesthetic representations, which might contribute to verbal actions. As such, the present findings suggest the idea that imagined tongue movements, involving segmentary kinesthetic actions, could be the prerequisite of language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Structural Features of the Human Connectome That Facilitate the Switching of Brain Dynamics via Noradrenergic Neuromodulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structural connectivity of human brain allows the coexistence of segregated and integrated states of activity. Neuromodulatory systems facilitate the transition between these functional states and recent computational studies have shown how an interplay between the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems define these transitions. However, there is still much to be known about the interaction between the structural connectivity and the effect of neuromodulation, and to what extent the connectome facilitates dynamic transitions. In this work, we use a whole brain model, based on the Jasen and Rit equations plus a human structural connectivity matrix, to find out which structural features of the human connectome network define the optimal neuromodulatory effects. We simulated the effect of the noradrenergic system as changes in filter gain, and studied its effects related to the global-, local-, and meso-scale features of the connectome. At the global-scale, we found that the ability of the network of transiting through a variety of dynamical states is disrupted by randomization of the connection weights. By simulating neuromodulation of partial subsets of nodes, we found that transitions between integrated and segregated states are more easily achieved when targeting nodes with greater connection strengths—local feature—or belonging to the rich club—meso-scale feature. Overall, our findings clarify how the network spatial features, at different levels, interact with neuromodulation to facilitate the switching between segregated and integrated brain states and to sustain a richer brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Quantitative Assessment of Stress Through EEG During a Virtual Reality Stress-Relax Session</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.684423</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.684423</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have addressed stress level classification via electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning. These works typically use EEG-based features, like power spectral density (PSD), to develop stress classifiers. Nonetheless, these classifiers are usually limited to the discrimination of two (stress and no stress) or three (low, medium, and high) stress levels. In this study we propose an alternative for quantitative stress assessment based on EEG and regression algorithms. To this aim, we conducted a group of 23 participants (mean age 22.65 ± 5.48) over a stress-relax experience while monitoring their EEG. First, we stressed the participants via the Montreal imaging stress task (MIST), and then we led them through a 360-degree virtual reality (VR) relaxation experience. Throughout the session, the participants reported their self-perceived stress level (SPSL) via surveys. Subsequently, we extracted spectral features from the EEG of the participants and we developed individual models based on regression algorithms to predict their SPSL. We evaluated stress regression performance in terms of the mean squared percentage error (MSPE) and the correlation coefficient (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The results yielded from this evaluation (MSPE = 10.62 ± 2.12, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.02) suggest that our approach predicted the stress level of the participants with remarkable performance. These results may have a positive impact in diverse areas that could benefit from stress level quantitative prediction. These areas include research fields like neuromarketing, and training of professionals such as surgeons, industrial workers, or firefighters, that often face stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Local Cisplatin Delivery in Mouse Reliably Models Sensorineural Ototoxicity Without Systemic Adverse Effects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.701783</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cisplatin is a lifesaving chemotherapeutic drug with marked ototoxic adverse effects. Cisplatin-induced hearing loss affects a significant part of cancer-surviving patients and is an unmet clinical need with important socioeconomic consequences. Unfortunately, in current preclinical animal models of cisplatin ototoxicity, which are mainly based on systemic delivery, important morbidity is observed, leading to premature death. This methodology not only raises obvious animal welfare concerns but also increases the number of animals used in ototoxicity studies to compensate for dropouts related to early death. To overcome these important limitations, we developed a local delivery model based on the application of a cisplatin solution directly into the otic bulla through a retroauricular approach. The local delivery model reliably induced significant hearing loss with a mean threshold shift ranging from 10 to 30 dB, strongly affecting the high frequencies (22 and 32 kHz). Importantly, mice did not show visible stress or distress indicators and no significant morbidity in comparison with a traditional systemic delivery control group of mice injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg cisplatin, where significant weight loss &amp;gt;10% in all treated animals (without any recovery) led to premature abortion of experiments on day 3. Mass spectrometry confirmed the absence of relevant systemic uptake after local delivery, with platinum accumulation restricted to the cochlea, whereas important platinum concentrations were detected in the liver and kidney of the systemic cisplatin group. A clear correlation between the cochlear platinum concentration and the auditory threshold shift was observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed statistically significant loss of outer hair cells in the basal and apical turns of the cochlea and an important and statistically significant loss of auditory neurons and synapses in all cochlear regions. In conclusion, local cisplatin delivery induces robust hearing loss with minimal morbidity, thereby offering a reliable rodent model for human cisplatin ototoxicity, reducing the number of animals required and showing improved animal welfare compared with traditional systemic models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Platelets in the Stimulation of Neuronal Synaptic Plasticity, Electric Activity, and Oxidative Phosphorylation: Possibilities for New Therapy of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) is highly vascularized where neuronal cells are located in proximity to endothelial cells, astroglial limitans, and neuronal processes constituting integrated neurovascular units. In contrast to many other organs, the CNS has a blood-brain barrier (BBB), which becomes compromised due to infection, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, traumatic brain injury, and other reasons. BBB disruption is presumably involved in neuronal injury during epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, many types of neuropsychological disorders are accompanied by an increase in BBB permeability leading to direct contact of circulating blood cells in the capillaries with neuronal cells in the CNS. The second most abundant type of blood cells are platelets, which come after erythrocytes and outnumber ~100-fold circulating leukocytes. When BBB becomes compromised, platelets swiftly respond to the vascular injury and become engaged in thrombosis and hemostasis. However, more recent studies demonstrated that platelets could also enter CNS parenchyma and directly interact with neuronal cells. Within CNS, platelets become activated by recognizing major brain gangliosides on the surface of astrocytes and neurons and releasing a milieu of pro-inflammatory mediators, neurotrophic factors, and neurotransmitters. Platelet-derived factors directly stimulate neuronal electric and synaptic activity and promote the formation of new synapses and axonal regrowth near the site of damage. Despite such active involvement in response to CNS damage, the role of platelets in neurological disorders was not extensively studied, which will be the focus of this review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Otoferlin Is Required for Proper Synapse Maturation and for Maintenance of Inner and Outer Hair Cells in Mouse Models for DFNB9</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.677543</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.677543</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deficiency of otoferlin causes profound prelingual deafness in humans and animal models. Here, we closely analyzed developmental deficits and degenerative mechanisms in Otof knock-out (Otof&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice over the course of 48 weeks. We found otoferlin to be required for proper synapse development in the immature rodent cochlea: In absence of otoferlin, synaptic pruning was delayed, and postsynaptic boutons appeared enlarged at 2 weeks of age. At postnatal day 14 (P14), we found on average ∼15 synapses per inner hair cell (IHC) in Otof&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; cochleae as well as in wild-type controls. Further on, the number of synapses in Otof&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs was reduced to ∼7 at 8 weeks of age and to ∼6 at 48 weeks of age. In the same period, the number of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) declined in Otof&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; animals. Importantly, we found an age-progressive loss of IHCs to an overall number of 75% of wildtype IHCs. The IHC loss more prominently but not exclusively affected the basal aspects of the cochlea. For outer hair cells (OHCs), we observed slightly accelerated age-dependent degeneration from base to apex. This was associated with a progressive decay in DPOAE amplitudes for high frequency stimuli, which could first be observed at the age of 24 weeks in Otof&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Our data will help to plan and predict the outcome of a gene therapy applied at various ages of DFNB9 patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for the Treatment of Essential Tremor: A 2-Year Outcome Study of Chinese People</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.697029</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.697029</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder among elderly individuals worldwide and is occasionally associated with a high risk for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. This retrospective study aimed to determine the clinical outcome of unilateral magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy in Chinese patients with ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In total, 31 male and 17 female patients with drug-refractory ET were enrolled in this research study from January 2017 to September 2019. The severity of tremor and disability were assessed using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) within a 2-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age of the participants was 59.14 ± 13.5 years. The mean skull density ratio (SDR) was 0.5 ± 0.1. The mean highest temperature was 57.0 ± 2.4°C. The mean number of sonications was 10.0 ± 2.6. The average maximum energy was 19,710.5 ± 8,624.9 J. The total CRST scores and sub-scores after MRgFUS thalamotomy significantly reduced during each follow-up (p &amp;lt; 0.001). All but four (8.3%) of the patients had reversible adverse events (AEs) after the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: MRgFUS had sustained clinical efficacy 2 years after treatment for intractable ET. Only few patients presented with thalamotomy-related AEs including numbness, weakness, and ataxia for an extended period. Most Chinese patients were treated safely and effectively despite their low SDR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cortical Engagement Metrics During Reactive Balance Are Associated With Distinct Aspects of Balance Behavior in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684743</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heightened reliance on the cerebral cortex for postural stability with aging is well-known, yet the cortical mechanisms for balance control, particularly in relation to balance function, remain unclear. Here we aimed to investigate motor cortical activity in relation to the level of balance challenge presented during reactive balance recovery and identify circuit-specific interactions between motor cortex and prefrontal or somatosensory regions in relation to metrics of balance function that predict fall risk. Using electroencephalography, we assessed motor cortical beta power, and beta coherence during balance reactions to perturbations in older adults. We found that individuals with greater motor cortical beta power evoked following standing balance perturbations demonstrated lower general clinical balance function. Individual older adults demonstrated a wide range of cortical responses during balance reactions at the same perturbation magnitude, showing no group-level change in prefrontal- or somatosensory-motor coherence in response to perturbations. However, older adults with the highest prefrontal-motor coherence during the post-perturbation, but not pre-perturbation, period showed greater cognitive dual-task interference (DTI) and elicited stepping reactions at lower perturbation magnitudes. Our results support motor cortical beta activity as a potential biomarker for individual level of balance challenge and implicate prefrontal-motor cortical networks in distinct aspects of balance control involving response inhibition of reactive stepping in older adults. Cortical network activity during balance may provide a neural target for precision-medicine efforts aimed at fall prevention with aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neurological Mechanisms of Animal-Assisted Intervention in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Hypothetical Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder with aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau as the pathological hallmarks. AD is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline of cognition. The failure of pharmacological approaches to treat AD has resulted in an increased focus on non-pharmacological interventions that can mitigate cognitive decline and delay disease progression in patients with AD. Animal-assisted intervention (AAI), a non-pharmacological intervention, improves emotional, social, and cognitive dysfunction in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, AAI is reported to mitigate the effects of cognitive impairment in patients with AD. Despite the positive effects of AAI on cognitive dysfunction in patients with AD, there have been no studies on how AAI affects AD-related pathologies. This review postulates potential neurological mechanisms of emotional or social interaction through AAI in countering AD-related pathologies, such as Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), and proposes insights for future research by organizing accumulated previous evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Screening Tools and Assessment Methods of Cognitive Decline Associated With Age-Related Hearing Loss: A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.677090</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.677090</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Strong links between hearing and cognitive function have been confirmed by a growing number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Seniors with age-related hearing loss (ARHL) have a significantly higher cognitive impairment incidence than those with normal hearing. The correlation mechanism between ARHL and cognitive decline is not fully elucidated to date. However, auditory intervention for patients with ARHL may reduce the risk of cognitive decline, as early cognitive screening may improve related treatment strategies. Currently, clinical audiology examinations rarely include cognitive screening tests, partly due to the lack of objective quantitative indicators with high sensitivity and specificity. Questionnaires are currently widely used as a cognitive screening tool, but the subject’s performance may be negatively affected by hearing loss. Numerous electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies analyzed brain structure and function changes in patients with ARHL. These objective electrophysiological tools can be employed to reveal the association mechanism between auditory and cognitive functions, which may also find biological markers to be more extensively applied in assessing the progression towards cognitive decline and observing the effects of rehabilitation training for patients with ARHL. In this study, we reviewed clinical manifestations, pathological changes, and causes of ARHL and discussed their cognitive function effects. Specifically, we focused on current cognitive screening tools and assessment methods and analyzed their limitations and potential integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association of Tau Pathology With Clinical Symptoms in the Subfields of Hippocampal Formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.672077</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.672077</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To delineate the relationship between clinical symptoms and tauopathy of the hippocampal subfields under different amyloid statuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and forty-three subjects were obtained from the ADNI project, including 87 individuals with normal cognition, 46 with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). All subjects underwent the tau PET, amyloid PET, T1W, and high-resolution T2W scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognition 13 (ADAS-cog-13) total score, comprising memory and executive function scores. The hippocampal subfields including Cornu Ammonis (CA1–3), subiculum (Sub), and dentate gyrus (DG), as well as the adjacent para-hippocampus (PHC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC), were segmented automatically using the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software. The relationship between tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal subfields and assessment scores was calculated using partial correlation analysis under different amyloid status, by controlling age, gender, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele ɛ4 carrier status, and, time interval between the acquisition time of tau PET and amyloid PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with amyloid negative (A−) group, individuals from amyloid positive (A+) group are more impaired based on the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE; p = 3.82e-05), memory (p = 6.30e-04), executive function (p = 0.0016), and ADAS-cog-13 scores (p = 5.11e-04). Significant decrease of volume (CA1, DG, and Sub) and increase of tau deposition (CA1, Sub, ERC, and PHC) of the hippocampal subfields of both hemispheres were observed for the A+ group compared to the A- group. Tauopathy of ERC is significantly associated with memory score for the A- group, and the associated regions spread into Sub and PHC for the A+ group. The relationship between the impairment of behavior or executive function and tauopathy of the hippocampal subfield was discovered within the A+ group. Leftward asymmetry was observed with the association between assessment scores and tauopathy of the hippocampal subfield, which is more prominent for the NPI score for the A+ group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The associations of tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal subfields with clinical symptoms provide additional insight into the understanding of local changes of the human HF during the AD continuum and can be used as a reference for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Brain Frequency-Specific Changes in the Spontaneous Neural Activity Are Associated With Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Presbycusis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Presbycusis (PC) is characterized by preferential hearing loss at high frequencies and difficulty in speech recognition in noisy environments. Previous studies have linked PC to cognitive impairment, accelerated cognitive decline and incident Alzheimer’s disease. However, the neural mechanisms of cognitive impairment in patients with PC remain unclear. Although resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have explored low-frequency oscillation (LFO) connectivity or amplitude of PC-related neural activity, it remains unclear whether the abnormalities occur within all frequency bands or within specific frequency bands. Fifty-one PC patients and fifty-one well-matched normal hearing controls participated in this study. The LFO amplitudes were investigated using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) at different frequency bands (slow-4 and slow-5). PC patients showed abnormal LFO amplitudes in the Heschl’s gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), frontal eye field and key nodes of the speech network exclusively in slow-4, which suggested that abnormal spontaneous neural activity in PC was frequency dependent. Our findings also revealed that stronger functional connectivity between the dlPFC and the posterodorsal stream of auditory processing, as well as lower functional coupling between the PCC and key nodes of the DMN, which were associated with cognitive impairments in PC patients. Our study might underlie the cross-modal plasticity and higher-order cognitive participation of the auditory cortex after partial hearing deprivation. Our findings indicate that frequency-specific analysis of ALFF could provide valuable insights into functional alterations in the auditory cortex and non-auditory regions involved in cognitive impairment associated with PC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: A locomotor neural circuit persists and functions similarly in larvae and adult Drosophila </title>

	<description>Individual neurons can undergo drastic structural changes, known as neuronal remodeling or structural plasticity. One example of this is in response to hormones, such as during puberty in mammals or metamorphosis in insects. However, in each of these examples it remains unclear whether the remodeled neuron resumes prior patterns of connectivity, and if so, whether the persistent circuits drive similar behaviors. Here, we utilize a well-characterized neural circuit in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;larva: the Moonwalking Descending Neuron (MDN) circuit. We previously showed that larval MDN induces backward crawling, and synapses onto the Pair1 interneuron to inhibit forward crawling (Carreira-Rosario et al., 2018). MDN is remodeled during metamorphosis and regulates backward walking in the adult fly. We investigated whether Pair1 is remodeled during metamorphosis and functions within the MDN circuit during adulthood. We assayed morphology and molecular markers to demonstrate that Pair1 is remodeled during metamorphosis and persists in the adult fly. MDN-Pair1 connectivity is lost during early pupal stages, when both neurons are severely pruned back, but connectivity is re-established at mid-pupal stages and persist into the adult. In the adult, optogenetic activation of Pair1 resulted in arrest of forward locomotion, similar to what is observed in larvae. Thus, the MDN-Pair1 neurons are an interneuronal circuit - a pair of synaptically connected interneurons – that is re-established during metamorphosis, yet generates similar locomotor behavior at both larval and adult stages.</description>

	<title>eLife: Single-cell analysis of the ventricular-subventricular zone reveals signatures of dorsal &amp; ventral adult neurogenesis</title>

	<description>The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), on the walls of the lateral ventricles, harbors the layrgest neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain. Previous work has shown that neural steym/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in different locations within the V-SVZ produce different subtypes of new neurons for the olfactory bulb. The molecular signatures that underlie this regional heterogeneity remain largely unknown. Here we present a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of the adult mouse V-SVZ revealing two populations of NSPCs that reside in largely non-overlapping domains in either the dorsal or ventral V-SVZ. These regional differences in gene expression were further validated using a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing reference dataset of regionally microdissected domains of the V-SVZ and by immunocytochemistry and RNAscope localization. We also identify two subpopulations of young neurons that have gene expression profiles consistent with a dorsal or ventral origin. Interestingly, a subset of genes are dynamically expressed, but maintained, in the ventral or dorsal lineages. The study provides novel markers and territories to understand the region-specific regulation of adult neurogenesis.</description>

	<description>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that is associated with multiple neurological manifestations. Previously, we demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; loss in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) can cause altered social behavior in mice. Here, we performed detailed transcriptional and translational analyses of &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient PCs to understand the molecular alterations in these cells. We found that target transcripts of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) are reduced in mutant PCs with evidence of increased degradation. Surprisingly, we observed unchanged ribosomal binding for many of these genes using translating ribosome affinity purification. Finally, we found that multiple FMRP targets, including SHANK2, were reduced, suggesting that compensatory increases in ribosomal binding efficiency may be unable to overcome reduced transcript levels. These data further implicate dysfunction of FMRP and its targets in TSC and suggest that treatments aimed at restoring the function of these pathways may be beneficial.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Unconventional animal models for traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24920</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of death worldwide. It is a complex injury that influences cellular physiology, causes neuronal cell death, and affects molecular pathways in the brain. This in turn can result in sensory, motor, and behavioral alterations that deeply impact the quality of life. Repetitive mild TBI can progress into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative condition linked to severe behavioral changes. While current animal models of TBI and CTE such as rodents, are useful to explore affected pathways, clinical findings therein have rarely translated into clinical applications, possibly because of the many morphofunctional differences between the model animals and humans. It is therefore important to complement these studies with alternative animal models that may better replicate the individuality of human TBI. Comparative studies in animals with naturally evolved brain protection such as bighorn sheep, woodpeckers, and whales, may provide preventive applications in humans. The advantages of an in‐depth study of these unconventional animals are threefold. First, to increase knowledge of the often‐understudied species in question; second, to improve common animal models based on the study of their extreme counterparts; and finally, to tap into a source of biological inspiration for comparative studies and translational applications in humans.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathogenic MAST3 Variants in the STK Domain Are Associated with Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26147</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26147?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The MAST family of microtubule‐associated serine–threonine kinases (STKs) have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature human and mouse brain. To date, only MAST1 has been conclusively associated with neurological disease, with de novo variants in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, including a mega corpus callosum.


Methods
Using exome sequencing, we identify MAST3 missense variants in individuals with epilepsy. We also assess the effect of these variants on the ability of MAST3 to phosphorylate the target gene product ARPP‐16 in HEK293T cells.


Results
We identify de novo missense variants in the STK domain in 11 individuals, including 2 recurrent variants p.G510S (n = 5) and p.G515S (n = 3). All 11 individuals had developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with 8 having normal development prior to seizure onset at &amp;lt;2 years of age. All patients developed multiple seizure types, 9 of 11 patients had seizures triggered by fever and 9 of 11 patients had drug‐resistant seizures. In vitro analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with MAST3 cDNA carrying a subset of these patient‐specific missense variants demonstrated variable but generally lower expression, with concomitant increased phosphorylation of the MAST3 target, ARPP‐16, compared to wild‐type. These findings suggest the patient‐specific variants may confer MAST3 gain‐of‐function. Moreover, single‐nuclei RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry shows that MAST3 expression is restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex late in prenatal development and postnatally.


Interpretation
In summary, we describe MAST3 as a novel epilepsy‐associated gene with a potential gain‐of‐function pathogenic mechanism that may be primarily restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A β-Wrapin Targeting the N-Terminus of α-Synuclein Monomers Reduces Fibril-Induced Aggregation in Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.696440</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reducing α-synuclein pathology constitutes a plausible strategy against Parkinson’s disease. As we recently demonstrated, the β-wrapin protein AS69 binds an N-terminal region in monomeric α-synuclein, interferes with fibril nucleation, and reduces α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and in a fruit fly model of α-synuclein toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AS69 also reduces α-synuclein pathology in mammalian neurons. To induce α-synuclein pathology, primary mouse neurons were exposed to pre-formed fibrils (PFF) of human α-synuclein. PFF were also injected into the striatum of A30P-α-synuclein transgenic mice. The extent of α-synuclein pathology was determined by phospho-α-synuclein staining and by Triton X-100 solubility. The degeneration of neuronal somata, dendrites, and axon terminals was determined by immunohistochemistry. AS69 and PFF were taken up by primary neurons. AS69 did not alter PFF uptake, but AS69 did reduce PFF-induced α-synuclein pathology. PFF injection into mouse striatum led to α-synuclein pathology and dystrophic neurites. Co-injection of AS69 abrogated PFF-induced pathology. AS69 also reduced the PFF-induced degeneration of dopaminergic axon terminals in the striatum and the degeneration of dopaminergic dendrites in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. AS69 reduced the activation of astroglia but not microglia in response to PFF injection. Collectively, AS69 reduced PFF-induced α-synuclein pathology and the associated neurodegeneration in primary neurons and in mouse brain. Our data therefore suggest that small proteins binding the N-terminus of α-synuclein monomers are promising strategies to modify disease progression in Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Recording Strategies for High Channel Count, Densely Spaced Microelectrode Arrays</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience research into how complex brain functions are implemented at an extra-cellular level requires in vivo neural recording interfaces, including microelectrodes and read-out circuitry, with increased observability and spatial resolution. The trend in neural recording interfaces toward employing high-channel-count probes or 2D microelectrodes arrays with densely spaced recording sites for recording large neuronal populations makes it harder to save on resources. The low-noise, low-power requirement specifications of the analog front-end usually requires large silicon occupation, making the problem even more challenging. One common approach to alleviating this consumption area burden relies on time-division multiplexing techniques in which read-out electronics are shared, either partially or totally, between channels while preserving the spatial and temporal resolution of the recordings. In this approach, shared elements have to operate over a shorter time slot per channel and active area is thus traded off against larger operating frequencies and signal bandwidths. As a result, power consumption is only mildly affected, although other performance metrics such as in-band noise or crosstalk may be degraded, particularly if the whole read-out circuit is multiplexed at the analog front-end input. In this article, we review the different implementation alternatives reported for time-division multiplexing neural recording systems, analyze their advantages and drawbacks, and suggest strategies for improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decoding EEG Brain Activity for Multi-Modal Natural Language Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently, human behavioral data from reading has mainly been of interest to researchers to understand human cognition. However, these human language processing signals can also be beneficial in machine learning-based natural language processing tasks. Using EEG brain activity for this purpose is largely unexplored as of yet. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of systematically analyzing the potential of EEG brain activity data for improving natural language processing tasks, with a special focus on which features of the signal are most beneficial. We present a multi-modal machine learning architecture that learns jointly from textual input as well as from EEG features. We find that filtering the EEG signals into frequency bands is more beneficial than using the broadband signal. Moreover, for a range of word embedding types, EEG data improves binary and ternary sentiment classification and outperforms multiple baselines. For more complex tasks such as relation detection, only the contextualized BERT embeddings outperform the baselines in our experiments, which raises the need for further research. Finally, EEG data shows to be particularly promising when limited training data is available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Affective and Semantic Valence Among Women</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As an important dimension of emotional assessment, valence can refer to affective valence reflecting an emotional response, or semantic valence reflecting knowledge about the nature of a stimulus. A previous study has used repeated exposure to separate these two similar cognitive processes. Here, for the first time, we compared the spatiotemporal dynamics of the affective and semantic modes of valence by combining event-related potentials with repeated exposure. Forty-seven female participants were assigned to the feeling-focused and semantic-focused groups and thereafter repeatedly viewed the pictures selected for the study. Self-report behavioral results showed that post-test scores were significantly lower than pre-test scores in the feeling-focused group, while the differences between the two tests were not significant in the semantic-focused group. At the neural level, N2 amplitudes decreased and early late positive potential amplitudes increased in both groups, suggesting that the participants perceived the repeated pictures more fluently and retrieved the traces of the stimulus spontaneously regardless of the valence they judged. However, the late positive potential amplitudes in anterior areas and the activity of the middle frontal gyrus were attenuated in the feeling-focused group; however, this component in posterior areas and the activity of the precentral gyrus were increased in the semantic-focused group. Therefore, the processes of affective and semantic valence are similar in the early stages of image perception and retrieval, while in the later stage of valence judgment, these processes show different brain activation patterns. The results provide electrophysiological evidence for the differences in psychological processes when judging the two modes of valence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Negative Feedback Role of Astrocytes in Shaping Excitation in Brain Cell Co-cultures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glial cells play an important role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and may thus influence excitability in epileptogenesis. These cells in the brain have glutamate (Glu) transporters, which remove this neurotransmitter from the extracellular space. Lack of negative (−) feedback makes local neuronal circuits more excitable and potentially contributing to epileptogenic phenomena. In this study, the role of glial cells in providing (−) feedback is shown through different models of brain cells in culture imaged for intracellular calcium concentration [(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]. Moreover, here we study the individual cells by putting them in categories. Neuronal networks with high and low (−) feedback were established by using anti-mitotics to deplete glial cells. Separate stimuli with very low subthreshold concentrations of Glu (250–750 nM) were added to cultures to test if the order of stimulations matter in regard to calcium dynamics outcomes. Additionally, KCl and ATP were used to stimulate glial cells. We found that for cultures high in (−) feedback, order of the stimulus was not important in predicting cellular responses and because of the complexity of networks in low (−) feedback cultures the order of stimulus matters. As an additional method for analysis, comparison of high (−) feedback cultures, and pure astrocytes was also considered. Glial cells in pure astrocyte cultures tend to be larger in size than glial cells in high (−) feedback cultures. The potential effect of (−) feedback at the blood brain barrier (BBB) was also considered for the inflammatory responses of nitric oxide (NO) production and [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; regulation using brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). The inflammatory and calcium signaling pathways both indicate the negative feedback role of astrocytes, poised between the BBB and structures deeper within the brain, where neuronal synapses are homeostatically maintained by glial uptake of neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.692942</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) on neuroimaging of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and poor functional outcome (PFO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A thorough search of several databases was carried out to identify relevant studies up to December 2020. We included studies of patients with AIS and neuroimaging markers of CSVD treated with IVT. The primary outcome was HT, and the secondary outcomes were sICH and 3-month PFO. The quality of the studies involved was evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). The meta-analysis with the fixed effects model was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-four eligible studies (n = 9,419) were pooled in the meta-analysis. All included studies were regarded as high quality with the NOS scores of at least 6 points. The meta-analysis revealed associations between the presence of CSVD and HT, sICH, and the 3-month PFO after IVT. Compared with no CSVD, the presence of CSVD was associated with an increased risk of HT (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.52–2.16), sICH (OR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.76–3.33), and 3-month PFO (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.89–2.44). For patients with AIS complicated with CSVD, compared with a CSVD score of 0–1, a CSVD score of 2–4 was associated with an increased risk of HT (OR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.67–5.77), sICH (OR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.26–6.49), and 3-month PFO (OR: 4.58, 95% CI: 2.97–7.06).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Patients with AIS complicated with neuroimaging markers of CSVD are at increased risk of HT and 3-month PFO after IVT. However, it is still necessary to clarify the exact role of CSVD in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of AIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier CRD4202123 3900.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Acute TBK1/IKK-ε Inhibition Enhances the Generation of Disease-Associated Microglia-Like Phenotype Upon Cortical Stab-Wound Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury has a poorer prognosis in elderly patients, possibly because of the enhanced inflammatory response characteristic of advanced age, known as “inflammaging.” Recently, reduced activation of the TANK-Binding-Kinase 1 (Tbk1) pathway has been linked to age-associated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Here we investigated how the blockade of Tbk1 and of the closely related IKK-ε by the small molecule Amlexanox could modify the microglial and immune response to cortical stab-wound injury in mice. We demonstrated that Tbk1/IKK-ε inhibition resulted in a massive expansion of microglial cells characterized by the TMEM119&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype, expressing high levels of CD68 and CD317, and with the upregulation of Cst7a, Prgn and Ccl4 and the decrease in the expression levels of Tmem119 itself and P2yr12, thus a profile close to Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM, a subset of reactive microglia abundant in Alzheimer’s Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions). Furthermore, Tbk1/IKK-ε inhibition increased the infiltration of CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes, CD169&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages and CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD169&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. The enhanced immune response was associated with increased expression of Il-33, Ifn-g, Il-17, and Il-19. This upsurge in the response to the stab wound was associated with the expanded astroglial scars and increased deposition of chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans at 7 days post injury. Thus, Tbk1/IKK-ε blockade results in a massive expansion of microglial cells with a phenotype resembling DAM and with the substantial enhancement of neuroinflammatory responses. In this context, the induction of DAM is associated with a detrimental outcome such as larger injury-related glial scars. Thus, the Tbk1/IKK-ε pathway is critical to repress neuroinflammation upon stab-wound injury and Tbk1/IKK-ε inhibitors may provide an innovative approach to investigate the consequences of DAM induction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The elderly population is growing worldwide, with important health and socioeconomic implications. Clinical and experimental studies on aging have uncovered numerous changes in the brain, such as decreased neurogenesis, increased synaptic defects, greater metabolic stress, and enhanced inflammation. These changes are associated with cognitive decline and neurobehavioral deficits. Although aging is not a disease, it is a significant risk factor for functional worsening, affective impairment, disease exaggeration, dementia, and general disease susceptibility. Conversely, life events related to mental stress and trauma can also lead to accelerated age-associated disorders and dementia. Here, we review human studies and studies on mice and rats, such as those modeling human neurodegenerative diseases, that have helped elucidate (1) the dynamics and mechanisms underlying the biological and pathological aging of the main projecting systems in the brain (glutamatergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic) and (2) the effect of defective glutamatergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic projection on disabilities associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of age-related diseases can be an important element in the development of effective ways of treatment. In this context, we briefly analyze which adverse changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases in the cholinergic, glutaminergic and dopaminergic systems could be targeted by therapeutic strategies developed as a result of our better understanding of these damaging mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Surveillance is critical to mounting an appropriate and effective response to pandemics. However, aggregated case report data suffers from reporting delays and can lead to misleading inferences. Different from aggregated case report data, line list data is a table contains individual features such as dates of symptom onset and reporting for each reported case and a good source for modeling delays. Current methods for modeling reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which typically has missing symptom onset dates that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. Specifically, this Bayesian approach can accurately estimate the epidemic curve and instantaneous reproduction numbers, even with most symptom onset dates missing. The Bayesian approach is also robust to deviations from model assumptions, such as changes in the reporting delay distribution or incorrect specification of the maximum reporting delay. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproduction number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zM2NB6jqd7w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Partial information decomposition reveals that synergistic neural integration is greater downstream of recurrent information flow in organotypic cortical cultures</title>

The directionality of network information flow dictates how networks process information. A central component of information processing in both biological and artificial neural networks is their ability to perform synergistic integration–a type of computation. We established previously that synergistic integration varies directly with the strength of feedforward information flow. However, the relationships between both recurrent and feedback information flow and synergistic integration remain unknown. To address this, we analyzed the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons in organotypic cultures of mouse cortex. We asked how empirically observed synergistic integration–determined from partial information decomposition–varied with local functional network structure that was categorized into motifs with varying recurrent and feedback information flow. We found that synergistic integration was elevated in motifs with greater recurrent information flow beyond that expected from the local feedforward information flow. Feedback information flow was interrelated with feedforward information flow and was associated with decreased synergistic integration. Our results indicate that synergistic integration is distinctly influenced by the directionality of local information flow.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jqr7PfaiRyI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

miRNAs belong to small non-coding RNAs that are related to a number of complicated biological processes. Considerable studies have suggested that miRNAs are closely associated with many human diseases. In this study, we proposed a computational model based on Similarity Constrained Matrix Factorization for miRNA-Disease Association Prediction (SCMFMDA). In order to effectively combine different disease and miRNA similarity data, we applied similarity network fusion algorithm to obtain integrated disease similarity (composed of disease functional similarity, disease semantic similarity and disease Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity) and integrated miRNA similarity (composed of miRNA functional similarity, miRNA sequence similarity and miRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity). In addition, the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regularization terms and similarity constraint terms were added to traditional Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm to predict disease-related miRNAs. SCMFMDA achieved AUCs of 0.9675 and 0.9447 based on global Leave-one-out cross validation and five-fold cross validation, respectively. Furthermore, the case studies on two common human diseases were also implemented to demonstrate the prediction accuracy of SCMFMDA. The out of top 50 predicted miRNAs confirmed by experimental reports that indicated SCMFMDA was effective for prediction of relationship between miRNAs and diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/60fl2F9xdb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

On March 23 2020, the UK enacted an intensive, nationwide lockdown to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. As restrictions began to ease, more localized interventions were used to target resurgences in transmission. Understanding the spatial scale of networks of human interaction, and how these networks change over time, is critical to targeting interventions at the most at-risk areas without unnecessarily restricting areas at low risk of resurgence. We use detailed human mobility data aggregated from Facebook users to determine how the spatially-explicit network of movements changed before and during the lockdown period, in response to the easing of restrictions, and to the introduction of locally-targeted interventions. We also apply community detection techniques to the weighted, directed network of movements to identify geographically-explicit movement communities and measure the evolution of these community structures through time. We found that the mobility network became more sparse and the number of mobility communities decreased under the national lockdown, a change that disproportionately affected long distance connections central to the mobility network. We also found that the community structure of areas in which locally-targeted interventions were implemented following epidemic resurgence did not show reorganization of community structure but did show small decreases in indicators of travel outside of local areas. We propose that communities detected using Facebook or other mobility data be used to assess the impact of spatially-targeted restrictions and may inform policymakers about the spatial extent of human movement patterns in the UK. These data are available in near real-time, allowing quantification of changes in the distribution of the population across the UK, as well as changes in travel patterns to inform our understanding of the impact of geographically-targeted interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Iuzs7Xin6LM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world, causing high mortality and unprecedented restrictions on social and economic activity. Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ha8Ax35ZHqw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During sleep, the brain undergoes dynamic and structural changes. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, such changes have been observed in the central complex, a brain area important for sleep control and navigation. The connectivity of the central complex raises the question about how navigation, and specifically the head direction system, can operate in the face of sleep related plasticity. To address this question, we develop a model that integrates sleep homeostasis and head direction. We show that by introducing plasticity, the head direction system can function in a stable way by balancing plasticity in connected circuits that encode sleep pressure. With increasing sleep pressure, the head direction system nevertheless becomes unstable and a sleep phase with a different plasticity mechanism is introduced to reset network connectivity. The proposed integration of sleep homeostasis and head direction circuits captures features of their neural dynamics observed in flies and mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NttFk8xUlv8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Increased availability of epidemiological data, novel digital data streams, and the rise of powerful machine learning approaches have generated a surge of research activity on real-time epidemic forecast systems. In this paper, we propose the use of a novel data source, namely retail market data to improve seasonal influenza forecasting. Specifically, we consider supermarket retail data as a proxy signal for influenza, through the identification of sentinel baskets, i.e., products bought together by a population of selected customers. We develop a nowcasting and forecasting framework that provides estimates for influenza incidence in Italy up to 4 weeks ahead. We make use of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to produce the predictions of seasonal flu incidence. Our predictions outperform both a baseline autoregressive model and a second baseline based on product purchases. The results show quantitatively the value of incorporating retail market data in forecasting models, acting as a proxy that can be used for the real-time analysis of epidemics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X-Qfy94dv74&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The super repertoire of type IV effectors in the pangenome of &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. provides insights into host-specificity and pathogenesis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Christophe Noroy, Damien F. Meyer&lt;/p&gt;

The identification of bacterial effectors is essential to understand how obligatory intracellular bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. manipulate the host cell for survival and replication. Infection of mammals–including humans–by the intracellular pathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. depends largely on the injection of virulence proteins that hijack host cell processes. Several hypothetical virulence proteins have been identified in &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp., but one so far has been experimentally shown to translocate into host cells via the type IV secretion system. However, the current challenge is to identify most of the type IV effectors (T4Es) to fully understand their role in &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. virulence and host adaptation. Here, we predict the T4E repertoires of four sequenced &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. and four other &lt;i&gt;Anaplasmataceae&lt;/i&gt; as comparative models (pathogenic &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; endosymbiont) using previously developed S4TE 2.0 software. This analysis identified 579 predicted T4Es (228 pT4Es for &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. only). The effector repertoires of &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. overlapped, thereby defining a conserved core effectome of 92 predicted effectors shared by all strains. In addition, 69 species-specific T4Es were predicted with non-canonical GC% mostly in gene sparse regions of the genomes and we observed a bias in pT4Es according to host-specificity. We also identified new protein domain combinations, suggesting novel effector functions. This work presenting the predicted effector collection of &lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia&lt;/i&gt; spp. can serve as a guide for future functional characterisation of effectors and design of alternative control strategies against these bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JUb3hxDCvVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Understanding the origins of biodiversity has been an aspiration since the days of early naturalists. The immense complexity of ecological, evolutionary, and spatial processes, however, has made this goal elusive to this day. Computer models serve progress in many scientific fields, but in the fields of macroecology and macroevolution, eco-evolutionary models are comparatively less developed. We present a general, spatially explicit, eco-evolutionary engine with a modular implementation that enables the modeling of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary processes and feedbacks across representative spatiotemporally dynamic landscapes. Modeled processes can include species’ abiotic tolerances, biotic interactions, dispersal, speciation, and evolution of ecological traits. Commonly observed biodiversity patterns, such as α, β, and γ diversity, species ranges, ecological traits, and phylogenies, emerge as simulations proceed. As an illustration, we examine alternative hypotheses expected to have shaped the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) during the Earth’s Cenozoic era. Our exploratory simulations simultaneously produce multiple realistic biodiversity patterns, such as the LDG, current species richness, and range size frequencies, as well as phylogenetic metrics. The model engine is open source and available as an R package, enabling future exploration of various landscapes and biological processes, while outputs can be linked with a variety of empirical biodiversity patterns. This work represents a key toward a numeric, interdisciplinary, and mechanistic understanding of the physical and biological processes that shape Earth’s biodiversity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ULZUEnUzPIg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and can be followed by low-level persistent viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019–2020 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [95% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [95% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patient’s infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patient’s progress through infection stages. Frequent, rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H6EMenEDFn0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Defects in mitochondrial function activate compensatory responses in the cell. Mitochondrial stress that is caused by unfolded proteins inside the organelle induces a transcriptional response (termed the “mitochondrial unfolded protein response” [UPRmt]) that is mediated by activating transcription factor associated with stress 1 (ATFS-1). The UPRmt increases mitochondrial protein quality control. Mitochondrial dysfunction frequently causes defects in the import of proteins, resulting in the accumulation of mitochondrial proteins outside the organelle. In yeast, cells respond to mistargeted mitochondrial proteins by increasing activity of the proteasome in the cytosol (termed the “unfolded protein response activated by mistargeting of proteins” [UPRam]). The presence and relevance of this response in higher eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that defects in mitochondrial protein import in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; lead to proteasome activation and life span extension. Both proteasome activation and life span prolongation partially depend on ATFS-1, despite its lack of influence on proteasomal gene transcription. Importantly, life span prolongation depends on the fully assembled proteasome. Our data provide a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and proteasomal activity and demonstrate its direct relevance to mechanisms that promote longevity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sjzJcaVE5Lo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: ANXA1 with Anti‐Inflammatory Properties Might Contribute to Parkinsonism</title>

	<description>We here describe the identification of a novel variant in the anti‐inflammatory Annexin A1 protein likely to be the cause of disease in two siblings with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. The disease‐segregating variant was ascertained through a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole genome sequencing and was shown to impair phagocytosis in zebrafish mutant embryos. The highly conserved variant, absent in healthy individuals and public SNP databases, affected a functional domain of the protein with neuroprotective properties. This study supports the hypothesis that damaged microglia might lead to impairments in the clearance of accumulated and aggregated proteins resulting in parkinsonism. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression in Developing Mouse Neocortex: Intermediate Progenitors Implicated in Axon Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.686034</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.686034</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral cortex projection neurons (PNs) are generated from intermediate progenitors (IPs), which are in turn derived from radial glial progenitors (RGPs). To investigate developmental processes in IPs, we profiled IP transcriptomes in embryonic mouse neocortex, using transgenic Tbr2-GFP mice, cell sorting, and microarrays. These data were used in combination with in situ hybridization to ascertain gene sets specific for IPs, RGPs, PNs, interneurons, and other neural and non-neural cell types. RGP-selective transcripts (n = 419) included molecules for Notch receptor signaling, proliferation, neural stem cell identity, apical junctions, necroptosis, hippo pathway, and NF-κB pathway. RGPs also expressed specific genes for critical interactions with meningeal and vascular cells. In contrast, IP-selective genes (n = 136) encoded molecules for activated Delta ligand presentation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, core planar cell polarity (PCP), axon genesis, and intrinsic excitability. Interestingly, IPs expressed several “dependence receptors” (Unc5d, Dcc, Ntrk3, and Epha4) that induce apoptosis in the absence of ligand, suggesting a competitive mechanism for IPs and new PNs to detect key environmental cues or die. Overall, our results imply a novel role for IPs in the patterning of neuronal polarization, axon differentiation, and intrinsic excitability prior to mitosis. Significantly, IPs highly express Wnt-PCP, netrin, and semaphorin pathway molecules known to regulate axon polarization in other systems. In sum, IPs not only amplify neurogenesis quantitatively, but also molecularly “prime” new PNs for axogenesis, guidance, and excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Foveal Remodeling of Retinal Microvasculature in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.708700</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.708700</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Retinal microvascular alterations have been previously described in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). However, an extensive description of retinal vascular morphological features, their association with PD-related clinical variables and their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers has not been explored.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed a cross-sectional study including 49 PD patients (87 eyes) and 40 controls (73 eyes). Retinal microvasculature was evaluated with Spectralis OCT-A and cognitive status with Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Unified PD Rating Scale and disease duration were recorded in patients. We extracted microvascular parameters from superficial and deep vascular plexuses of the macula, including the area and circularity of foveal avascular zone (FAZ), skeleton density, perfusion density, vessel perimeter index, vessel mean diameter, fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity using Python and MATLAB. We compared the microvascular parameters between groups and explored their association with thickness of macular layers and clinical outcomes. Data were analyzed with General Estimating Equations (GEE) and adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension. Logistic regression GEE models were fitted to predict diagnosis of PD versus controls from microvascular, demographic, and clinical data. The discrimination ability of models was tested with receiver operating characteristic curves.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;FAZ area was significantly smaller in patients compared to controls in superficial and deep plexuses, whereas perfusion density, skeleton density, FD and lacunarity of capillaries were increased in the foveal zone of PD. In the parafovea, microvascular parameters of superficial plexus were associated with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness, but this was mainly driven by PD with mild cognitive impairment. No such associations were observed in controls. FAZ area was negatively associated with cognition in PD (non-adjusted models). Foveal lacunarity, combined with demographic and clinical confounding factors, yielded an outstanding diagnostic accuracy for discriminating PD patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease patients displayed foveal microvascular alterations causing an enlargement of the vascular bed surrounding FAZ. Parafoveal microvascular alterations were less pronounced but were related to inner retinal layer thinning. Retinal microvascular abnormalities helped discriminating PD from controls. All this supports OCT-A as a potential non-invasive biomarker to reveal vascular pathophysiology and improve diagnostic accuracy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: MRI Radiomic Signature of White Matter Hyperintensities Is Associated With Clinical Phenotypes</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging measurements of brain structural integrity are thought to be surrogates for brain health, but precise assessments require dedicated advanced image acquisitions. By means of quantitatively describing conventional images, radiomic analyses hold potential for evaluating brain health. We sought to: (1) evaluate radiomics to assess brain structural integrity by predicting white matter hyperintensities burdens (WMH) and (2) uncover associations between predictive radiomic features and clinical phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed a multi-site cohort of 4,163 acute ischemic strokes (AIS) patients with T2-FLAIR MR images with total brain and WMH segmentations. Radiomic features were extracted from normal-appearing brain tissue (brain mask–WMH mask). Radiomics-based prediction of personalized WMH burden was done using ElasticNet linear regression. We built a radiomic signature of WMH with stable selected features predictive of WMH burden and then related this signature to clinical variables using canonical correlation analysis (CCA).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Radiomic features were predictive of WMH burden (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.855 ± 0.011). Seven pairs of canonical variates (CV) significantly correlated the radiomics signature of WMH and clinical traits with respective canonical correlations of 0.81, 0.65, 0.42, 0.24, 0.20, 0.15, and 0.15 (FDR-corrected p-values&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, p-value&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.012). The clinical CV1 was mainly influenced by age, CV2 by sex, CV3 by history of smoking and diabetes, CV4 by hypertension, CV5 by atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes, CV6 by coronary artery disease (CAD), and CV7 by CAD and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomics extracted from T2-FLAIR images of AIS patients capture microstructural damage of the cerebral parenchyma and correlate with clinical phenotypes, suggesting different radiographical textural abnormalities per cardiovascular risk profile. Further research could evaluate radiomics to predict the progression of WMH and for the follow-up of stroke patients’ brain health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Evoked Compound Action Potential as a Predictor for Perception in Chronic Pain Patients: Tools for Automatic Spinal Cord Stimulator Programming and Control</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a drug free treatment for chronic pain. Recent technological advances have enabled sensing of the evoked compound action potential (ECAP), a biopotential that represents neural activity elicited from SCS. The amplitudes of many SCS paradigms – both sub- and supra-threshold – are programmed relative to the patient’s perception of SCS. The objective of this study, then, is to elucidate relationships between the ECAP and perception thresholds across posture and SCS pulse width. These relationships may be used for the automatic control and perceptually referenced programming of SCS systems.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;ECAPs were acquired from 14 subjects across a range of postures and pulse widths with swept amplitude stimulation. Perception (PT) and discomfort (DT) thresholds were recorded. A stimulation artifact reduction scheme was employed, and growth curves were constructed from the sweeps. An estimate of the ECAP threshold (ET), was calculated from the growth curves using a novel approach. Relationships between ET, PT, and DT were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ETs were estimated from 112 separate growth curves. For the postures and pulse widths assessed, the ET tightly correlated with both PT (r = 0.93; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and DT (r = 0.93; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The median accuracy of ET as a predictor for PT across both posture and pulse width was 0.5 dB. Intra-subject, ECAP amplitudes at DT varied up to threefold across posture.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We provide evidence that the ET varies across both different positions and varying pulse widths and suggest that this variance may be the result of postural dependence of the recording electrode-tissue spacing. ET-informed SCS holds promise as a tool for SCS parameter configuration and may offer more accuracy over alternative approaches for neural and perceptual control in closed loop SCS systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Infant and Child MRI: A Review of Scanning Procedures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe method to examine human brain. However, a typical MR scan is very sensitive to motion, and it requires the subject to lie still during the acquisition, which is a major challenge for pediatric scans. Consequently, in a clinical setting, sedation or general anesthesia is often used. In the research setting including healthy subjects anesthetics are not recommended for ethical reasons and potential longer-term harm. Here we review the methods used to prepare a child for an MRI scan, but also on the techniques and tools used during the scanning to enable a successful scan. Additionally, we critically evaluate how studies have reported the scanning procedure and success of scanning. We searched articles based on special subject headings from PubMed and identified 86 studies using brain MRI in healthy subjects between 0 and 6 years of age. Scan preparations expectedly depended on subject’s age; infants and young children were scanned asleep after feeding and swaddling and older children were scanned awake. Comparing the efficiency of different procedures was difficult because of the heterogeneous reporting of the used methods and the success rates. Based on this review, we recommend more detailed reporting of scanning procedure to help find out which are the factors affecting the success of scanning. In the long term, this could help the research field to get high quality data, but also the clinical field to reduce the use of anesthetics. Finally, we introduce the protocol used in scanning 2 to 5-week-old infants in the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, and tips for calming neonates during the scans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Prefrontal GABAergic Interneurons Gate Long-Range Afferents to Regulate Prefrontal Cortex-Associated Complex Behaviors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.716408</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs) and their innervations are essential for the execution of complex behaviors such as working memory, social behavior, and fear expression. These behavior regulations are highly dependent on primary long-range afferents originating from the subcortical structures such as mediodorsal thalamus (MD), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). In turn, the regulatory effects of these inputs are mediated by activation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and/or somatostatin expressing (SST) INs within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we review how each of these long-range afferents from the MD, vHPC, or BLA recruits a subset of the prefrontal interneuron population to exert precise control of specific PFC-dependent behaviors. Specifically, we first summarize the anatomical connections of different long-range inputs formed on prefrontal GABAergic INs, focusing on PV versus SST cells. Next, we elaborate on the role of prefrontal PV- and SST- INs in regulating MD afferents-mediated cognitive behaviors. We also examine how prefrontal PV- and SST- INs gate vHPC afferents in spatial working memory and fear expression. Finally, we discuss the possibility that prefrontal PV-INs mediate fear conditioning, predominantly driven by the BLA-mPFC pathway. This review will provide a broad view of how multiple long-range inputs converge on prefrontal interneurons to regulate complex behaviors and novel future directions to understand how PFC controls different behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Laser-Induced Apoptosis of Corticothalamic Neurons in Layer VI of Auditory Cortex Impact on Cortical Frequency Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticofugal projections outnumber subcortical input projections by far. However, the specific role for signal processing of corticofugal feedback is still less well understood in comparisonto the feedforward projection. Here, we lesioned corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layers V and/or VI of the auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils by laser-induced photolysis to investigate their contribution to cortical activation patterns. We have used laminar current-source density (CSD) recordings of tone-evoked responses and could show that, particularly, lesion of CT neurons in layer VI affected cortical frequency processing. Specifically, we found a decreased gain of best-frequency input in thalamocortical (TC)-recipient input layers that correlated with the relative lesion of layer VI neurons, but not layer V neurons. Using cortical silencing with the GABA&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-agonist muscimol and layer-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), we found that direct activation of infragranular layers recruited a local recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical loop of synaptic input. This recurrent feedback was also only interrupted when lesioning layer VI neurons, but not cells in layer V. Our study thereby shows distinct roles of these two types of CT neurons suggesting a particular impact of CT feedback from layer VI to affect the local feedforward frequency processing in auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Computational Study of Astrocytic GABA Release at the Glutamatergic Synapse: EAAT-2 and GAT-3 Coupled Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682460</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter dynamics within neuronal synapses can be controlled by astrocytes and reflect key contributors to neuronal activity. In particular, Glutamate (Glu) released by activated neurons is predominantly removed from the synaptic space by perisynaptic astrocytic transporters EAAT-2 (GLT-1). In previous work, we showed that the time course of Glu transport is affected by ionic concentration gradients either side of the astrocytic membrane and has the propensity for influencing postsynaptic neuronal excitability. Experimental findings co-localize GABA transporters GAT-3 with EAAT-2 on the perisynaptic astrocytic membrane. While these transporters are unlikely to facilitate the uptake of synaptic GABA, this paper presents simulation results which demonstrate the coupling of EAAT-2 and GAT-3, giving rise to the ionic-dependent reversed transport of GAT-3. The resulting efflux of GABA from the astrocyte to the synaptic space reflects an important astrocytic mechanism for modulation of hyperexcitability. Key results also illustrate an astrocytic-mediated modulation of synaptic neuronal excitation by released GABA at the glutamatergic synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predicting Age From Behavioral Test Performance for Screening Early Onset of Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661514</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661514</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neuronal reactions and cognitive processes slow down during aging. The onset, rate, and extent of changes vary considerably from individual to individual. Assessing the changes throughout the lifespan is a challenging task. No existing test covers all domains, and batteries of tests are administered. The best strategy is to study each functional domain separately by applying different behavioral tasks whereby the tests reflect the conceptual structure of cognition. Such an approach has limitations that are described in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Our aim was to improve the diagnosis of early cognitive decline. We estimated the onset of cognitive decline in a healthy population, using behavioral tests, and predicted the age group of an individual. The comparison between the predicted (“cognitive”) and chronological age will contribute to the early diagnosis of accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: We used publicly available datasets (POBA, SSCT) and Pearson correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between age and tests results, Kruskal-Wallis test to compare distribution, clustering methods to find an onset of cognitive decline, feature selection to enhance performance of the clustering algorithms, and classification methods to predict an age group from cognitive tests results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The major results of the psychophysiological tests followed a U-shape function across the lifespan, which reflected the known inverted function of white matter volume changes. Optimal values were observed in those aged over 35 years, with a period of stability and accelerated decline after 55–60 years of age. The shape of the age-related variance of the performance of major cognitive tests was linear, which followed the trend of lifespan gray matter volume changes starting from adolescence. There was no significant sex difference in lifelong dynamics of major tests estimates. The performance of the classification model for identifying subject age groups was high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: ML models can be designed and utilized as computer-aided detectors of neurocognitive decline. Our study demonstrated great promise for the utility of classification models to predict age-related changes. These findings encourage further explorations combining several tests from the cognitive and psychophysiological test battery to derive the most reliable set of tests toward the development of a highly-accurate ML model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Connectome analysis of male world‐class gymnasts using probabilistic multishell, multitissue constrained spherical deconvolution tracking</title>

	<description>Using the MSMT‐CSD‐based connectome, we identified increased structural connectivity in Japanese male world‐class gymnasts (WCGs), involving sensorimotor, default mode, attentional, visual, and limbic subnetworks correlated with D‐scores of floor, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and years of training. Our findings indicated brain anatomical network plasticity in WCGs resulting from long‐term intensive training.

Abstract
In athletes, long‐term intensive training has been shown to increase unparalleled athletic ability and might induce brain plasticity. We evaluated the structural connectome of world‐class gymnasts (WCGs), as mapped by diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging probabilistic tractography and a multishell, multitissue constrained spherical deconvolution method to increase the precision of tractography at the tissue interfaces. The connectome was mapped in 10 Japanese male WCGs and in 10 age‐matched male controls. Network‐based statistic identified subnetworks with increased connectivity density in WCGs, involving the sensorimotor, default mode, attentional, visual, and limbic areas. It also revealed a significant association between the structural connectivity of some brain structures with functions closely related to the gymnastic skills and the D‐score, which is used as an index of the gymnasts' specific physical abilities for each apparatus. Furthermore, graph theory analysis demonstrated the characteristics of brain anatomical topology in the WCGs. They displayed significantly increased global connectivity strength with decreased characteristic path length at the global level and higher nodal strength and degree in the sensorimotor, default mode, attention, and limbic/subcortical areas at the local level as compared with controls. Together, these findings extend the current understanding of neural mechanisms that distinguish WCGs from controls and suggest brain anatomical network plasticity in WCGs resulting from long‐term intensive training. Future studies should assess the contribution of genetic or early‐life environmental factors in the brain network organization of WCGs. Furthermore, the indices of brain topology (i.e., connection density and graph theory indices) could become markers for the objective evaluation of gymnastic performance.</description>

	<description>Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the etiological agent for the most widespread fo rm of intestinal schistosomiasis. A neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptide precursors in Biomphalaria glabrata, the major intermediate host for S. mansoni in the Western Hemisphere. Three precursors encoding FMRF‐NH2‐related peptides were characterized and localized to specific neurons and cell groups in the central nervous system. The image shows the ventral lobe, a cluster of neurons that controls male reproductive behavior in snails.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the etiological agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. As neuropeptide signaling in host snails can be altered by trematode infection, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptide precursors in Biomphalaria glabrata, the major intermediate host for S. mansoni in the Western Hemisphere. Three transcripts that encode peptides belonging to the FMRF‐NH2‐related peptide (FaRP) family were identified in B. glabrata. One transcript encoded a precursor polypeptide (Bgl‐FaRP1; 292 amino acids) that included eight copies of the tetrapeptide FMRF‐NH2 and single copies of FIRF‐NH2, FLRF‐NH2, and pQFYRI‐NH2. The second transcript encoded a precursor (Bgl‐FaRP2; 347 amino acids) that comprised 14 copies of the heptapeptide GDPFLRF‐NH2 and 1 copy of SKPYMRF‐NH2. The precursor encoded by the third transcript (Bgl‐FaRP3; 287 amino acids) recapitulated Bgl‐FaRP2 but lacked the full SKPYMRF‐NH2 peptide. The three precursors shared a common signal peptide, suggesting a genomic organization described previously in gastropods. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on the nervous systems of B. glabrata and B. alexandrina, a major intermediate host for S. mansoni in Egypt. FMRF‐NH2‐like immunoreactive (FMRF‐NH2‐li) neurons were located in regions of the central nervous system associated with reproduction, feeding, and cardiorespiration. Antisera raised against non‐FMRF‐NH2 peptides present in the tetrapeptide and heptapeptide precursors labeled independent subsets of the FMRF‐NH2‐li neurons. This study supports the participation of FMRF‐NH2‐related neuropeptides in the regulation of vital physiological and behavioral systems that are altered by parasitism in Biomphalaria.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Nitrergic neurons of the forepaw representation in the rat somatosensory and motor cortices: A quantitative study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25192</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25192?af=R</link>
	<description>Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NNs) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NNs are more densely packed in the upper layers (I–III) and more sparsely distributed in Layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the Type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Parafacial neurons in the human brainstem express specific markers for neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25191?af=R</link>
	<description>Relying on duplex in situ hybridization, targeting PPGAL (pre‐pro‐galanin) and SLC17A6 mRNAs, neurons of the human retrotrapezoid nucleus were identified within the parafacial region of the brainstem. NeuromedinB (NMB), suggested as being a specific marker of RTN neurons in mice by others, was not convincing in our anatomical study, but could benefit from more thorough investigations.







Abstract
The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a hub for respiratory chemoregulation in the mammal brainstem that integrates chemosensory information from peripheral sites and central relays. Chemosensitive neurons of the RTN express specific genetic and molecular determinants, which have been used to identify RTN precise location within the brainstem of rodents and nonhuman primates. Based on a comparative approach, we hypothesized that among mammals, neurons exhibiting the same specific molecular and genetic signature would have the same function. The co‐expression of preprogalanin (PPGAL) and SLC17A6 (VGluT2) mRNAs with duplex in situ hybridization has been studied in formalin fixed paraffin‐embedded postmortem human brainstems. Two specimens were processed and analyzed in line with RTN descriptions in adult rats and macaques. Double‐labeled PPGAL+/SLC17A6+ neurons were only identified in the parafacial region of the brainstem. These neurons were found surrounding the nucleus of the facial nerve, located ventrally to the nucleus VII on caudal sections, and slightly more dorsally on rostral sections. The expression of neuromedin B (NMB) mRNA as a single marker of chemosensitive RTN neurons has not been confirmed in humans. The location of the RTN in human adults is provided. This should help to develop investigation tools combining anatomic high‐resolution imaging and respiratory functional investigations to explore the pathogenic role of the RTN in congenital or acquired neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Dual‐labeling immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing were used to characterize neurons in the basolateral amygdala that express SMI‐32+ nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs). Most of the neurons with strong somatic and dendritic expression of NNFs were parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, as well as nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs) that project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The graphical abstract shows six SMI‐32+ neurons (diffuse brown staining); five are also stained for PV (blue particulate staining) and one is PV‐negative (arrow). Studies in the cortex suggest that the SMI‐32+ neurons identified in this study may be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) containing nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs) localized with the SMI‐32 monoclonal antibody have been shown to be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present investigation is the first to study the expression of SMI‐32+ NNFs in neurons of the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BNC), which contains cortex‐like PNs and nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs). We observed that PNs in the rat basolateral nucleus (BL), but not in the lateral (LAT) or basomedial (BM) nuclei, have significant levels of SMI‐32‐ir in their somata with antibody diluents that did not contain Triton X‐100, but staining in these cells was greatly attenuated when the antibody diluent contained 0.3% Triton. Using Triton‐containing diluents, we found that all SMI‐32+ neurons in all three of the BNC nuclei were NPNs. Using a dual‐labeling immunoperoxidase technique, we demonstrated that most of these SMI‐32+ NPNs were parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) or somatostatin‐positive NPNs but not vasoactive intestinal peptide‐positive or neuropeptide Y‐positive NPNs. Using a technique that combines retrograde tracing with SMI‐32 immunohistochemistry using intermediate levels of Triton in the diluent, we found that all BNC neurons projecting to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were large NPNs, and most were SMI‐32+. In contrast, BNC neurons projecting to the ventral striatum or cerebral cortex were PNs that expressed low levels of SMI‐32 immunoreactivity (SMI‐32‐ir) in the BL, and no SMI‐32‐ir in the LAT or BM. These data suggest that the main neuronal subpopulations in the BNC that degenerate in AD may be PV+ and MD‐projecting NPNs.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Sexually dimorphic perineuronal nets in the rodent and primate reproductive circuit</title>

	<description>We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role of PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.







Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here, we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g., mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Robustness of neuronal tuning to binaural sound localization cues against age-related loss of inhibitory synaptic inputs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Go Ashida, Daniel J. Tollin, Jutta Kretzberg&lt;/p&gt;

Sound localization relies on minute differences in the timing and intensity of sound arriving at both ears. Neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the brainstem process these interaural disparities by precisely detecting excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Aging generally induces selective loss of inhibitory synaptic transmission along the entire auditory pathways, including the reduction of inhibitory afferents to LSO. Electrophysiological recordings in animals, however, reported only minor functional changes in aged LSO. The perplexing discrepancy between anatomical and physiological observations suggests a role for activity-dependent plasticity that would help neurons retain their binaural tuning function despite loss of inhibitory inputs. To explore this hypothesis, we use a computational model of LSO to investigate mechanisms underlying the observed functional robustness against age-related loss of inhibitory inputs. The LSO model is an integrate-and-fire type enhanced with a small amount of low-voltage activated potassium conductance and driven with (in)homogeneous Poissonian inputs. Without synaptic input loss, model spike rates varied smoothly with interaural time and level differences, replicating empirical tuning properties of LSO. By reducing the number of inhibitory afferents to mimic age-related loss of inhibition, overall spike rates increased, which negatively impacted binaural tuning performance, measured as modulation depth and neuronal discriminability. To simulate a recovery process compensating for the loss of inhibitory fibers, the strength of remaining inhibitory inputs was increased. By this modification, effects of inhibition loss on binaural tuning were considerably weakened, leading to an improvement of functional performance. These neuron-level observations were further confirmed by population modeling, in which binaural tuning properties of multiple LSO neurons were varied according to empirical measurements. These results demonstrate the plausibility that homeostatic plasticity could effectively counteract known age-dependent loss of inhibitory fibers in LSO and suggest that behavioral degradation of sound localization might originate from changes occurring more centrally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TukV8wmD-Pg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Gender differences in early stages of language development. Some evidence and possible explanations</title>

	<description>Abstract
It is a common feeling that girls speak earlier than boys; however, whether or not there are gender differences in early language acquisition remains controversial. The present paper aims to review the research on gender effects in early language acquisition and development, to determine whether, and from which age, an advantage for girls does eventually emerge. The focus is on the production of actions and communicative gestures, and early lexical comprehension and production, by girls and boys. The data from various studies that were conducted with direct and indirect tools suggest that some gender differences in actions, gesture, and lexical development depend on the interactions of different factors. Studies differ in terms of age ranges, sample sizes, and tools used, and the girl advantage is often slight and/or not evident at all ages considered. Statistical significance for gender differences appears to depend on the greater individual variability among boys, with respect to girls, which results in a greater number of boys classified as children with poor verbal ability. Biological (e.g., different maturational rates), neuropsychological (e.g., different cognitive strategies in solving tasks), and cultural (e.g., differences in the way parents relate socially to boys and girls) factors appear to interact, to create feedback loops of mutual reinforcement.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differential expression of microRNAs in the developing avian auditory hindbrain</title>

	<description>This study analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) in the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were broadly expressed in all four auditory nuclei. In the nucleus magnocelluaris (NM), nine miRNAs showed a spatially differential expression along the cochleotopic axis at embryonic Day 13, a prehearing stage. Quantification resulted in four distinct miRNA expression patterns, namely, homogenous, gradient, selective, and highly selective. The latter two expression patterns matched rhombomeric boundaries of this plurisegmental nucleus. Bioinformatics identified several functional groups of target mRNAs that might play an important role during ontogeny of this nucleus. This study adds miRNAs to the list of developmental gradients in the auditory system.







Abstract
The avian auditory hindbrain is a longstanding model for studying neural circuit development. Information on gene regulatory network (GRN) components underlying this process, however, is scarce. Recently, the spatiotemporal expression of 12 microRNAs (miRNAs) was investigated in the mammalian auditory hindbrain. As a comparative study, we here investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the orthologous miRNAs during development of the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were expressed both at E13, an immature stage, and P14, a mature stage of the auditory system. In most auditory nuclei, a homogeneous expression pattern was observed at both stages, like the mammalian system. An exception was the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). There, at E13, nine miRNAs showed a differential expression pattern along the cochleotopic axis with high expression at the rostromedial pole. One of them showed a gradient expression whereas eight showed a spatially selective expression at the rostral pole that reflected the different rhombomeric origins of this composite nucleus. The miRNA differential expression persisted in the NM to the mature stage, with the selective expression changed to linear gradients. Bioinformatics analysis predicted mRNA targets that are associated with neuronal developmental processes such as neurite and synapse organization, calcium and ephrin‐Eph signaling, and neurotransmission. Overall, this first analysis of miRNAs in the chicken central auditory system reveals shared and strikingly distinct features between chicken and murine orthologues. The embryonic gradient expression of these GRN elements in the NM adds miRNA patterns to the list of cochleotopic and developmental gradients in the central auditory system.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Over the last 40 years, ever‐growing interest in sex‐related differences in the human brain has led to a vast amount of literature on the subject, a small part of which relates to studies of differences in the ability to read. The data concerning typically developing children mainly come from school‐based screening projects (Programme for International Student Assessment, INVALSI) and partially from the standardization of reading tests. These have revealed the existence of a gap in favor of females that primarily appears during adolescence and in situations of sociocultural disadvantage, usually explained on the basis of environmental factors such as socioeconomic status and gender‐based education. Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is significantly more prevalent among males, a difference that neuroimaging and genetic studies have attributed to the presence of hormone‐related protective factors in females, although it has been hypothesized that a different neurocognitive substrate may also be involved. However, the literature on the subject is still limited, and further studies of the interactions between genetic risk, environmental factors, and brain phenotypes are needed to clarify why females are better at performing reading tasks and less susceptible to dyslexia, regardless of their language or the educational system in the country in which they live. The aim of this mini‐review was to describe the studies that have investigated sex‐related differences in reading ability in both typically and atypically developing subjects.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: ErbB4 mediates amyloid β‐induced neurotoxicity through JNK/tau pathway activation: Implications for Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25207</guid>

	<description>We investigated the role of ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV) neurons during Alzheimer's disease. Results revealed that ErbB4 in PV neurons might mediate Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity and reduce c‐Fos by activating the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK)/tau pathway, ultimately resulting in cognitive deficits. Moreover, JNK was activated by Aβ treatment rather than NRG1β1 treatment, suggesting that NRG1β1 and Aβ have different effects on ErbB4 downstream signaling pathways, probably providing a mechanism for NRG1 anti‐Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity.







Abstract
Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)‐positive interneurons was associated with Aβ‐induced cognitive deficits; however, the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we found that specific deletion of ErbB4 in PV neurons significantly attenuated oligomeric Aβ‐induced neuronal toxicity and inhibited Aβ‐induced decreases of PSD95 and synaptophysin. Moreover, specific ablation of ErbB4 in PV neurons altered activity‐related protein c‐Fos and decreased hippocampal PV neurons, especially in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hAPP‐J20 mice. Furthermore, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK), a protein downstream of ErbB4, was activated by Aβ but not ErbB4's ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) β1, suggesting different downstream pathways for Aβ and NRG1β1. JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by the ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 and by pretreatment with NRG1β1. More importantly, siRNA knockdown of ErbB4 decreased JNK phosphorylation and expression, tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Thr 205, and Bax expression. Therefore, ErbB4 might mediate Aβ‐induced neuropathology through the JNK/tau pathway and represent a potential therapeutic target in patients with AD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Inactivation of Prefrontal Cortex Delays Emergence From Sevoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.690717</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies aimed at investigating brain regions involved in arousal state control have been traditionally limited to subcortical structures. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inactivation of prefrontal cortex, but not two subregions within parietal cortex—somatosensory barrel field and medial/lateral parietal association cortex—would suppress arousal, as measured by an increase in anesthetic sensitivity. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were surgically prepared for recording electroencephalogram and bilateral infusion into prefrontal cortex (N = 13), somatosensory barrel field (N = 10), or medial/lateral parietal association cortex (N = 9). After at least 10 days of post-surgical recovery, 156 μM tetrodotoxin or saline was microinjected into one of the cortical sites. Ninety minutes after injection, rats were anesthetized with 2.5% sevoflurane and the time to loss of righting reflex, a surrogate for loss of consciousness, was measured. Sevoflurane was stopped after 45 min and the time to return of righting reflex, a surrogate for return of consciousness, was measured. Tetrodotoxin-mediated inactivation of all three cortical sites decreased (p &amp;lt; 0.05) the time to loss of righting reflex. By contrast, only inactivation of prefrontal cortex, but not somatosensory barrel field or medial/lateral parietal association cortex, increased (p &amp;lt; 0.001) the time to return of righting reflex. Burst suppression ratio was not altered following inactivation of any of the cortical sites, suggesting that there was no global effect due to pharmacologic lesion. These findings demonstrate that prefrontal cortex plays a causal role in emergence from anesthesia and behavioral arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Age-Related Transcriptional Deregulation of Genes Coding Synaptic Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease Murine Model: Potential Neuroprotective Effect of Fingolimod</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) induces time-dependent changes in sphingolipid metabolism, which may affect transcription regulation and neuronal phenotype. We, therefore, analyzed the influence of age, amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP), and the clinically approved, bioavailable sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720) on the expression of synaptic proteins. RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to real-time PCR. Expression of mutant (V717I) AβPP led to few changes at 3 months of age but reduced multiple mRNA coding for synaptic proteins in a 12-month-old mouse brain. Complexin 1 (Cplx1), SNAP25 (Snap25), syntaxin 1A (Stx1a), neurexin 1 (Nrxn1), neurofilament light (Nefl), and synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) in the hippocampus, and VAMP1 (Vamp1) and neurexin 1 (Nrxn1) in the cortex were all significantly reduced in 12-month-old mice. Post mortem AD samples from the human hippocampus and cortex displayed lower expression of VAMP, synapsin, neurofilament light (NF-L) and synaptophysin. The potentially neuroprotective FTY720 reversed most AβPP-induced changes in gene expression (Cplx1, Stx1a, Snap25, and Nrxn1) in the 12-month-old hippocampus, which is thought to be most sensitive to early neurotoxic insults, but it only restored Vamp1 in the cortex and had no influence in 3-month-old brains. Further study may reveal the potential usefulness of FTY720 in the modulation of deregulated neuronal phenotype in AD brains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine for Digital Twins Based Brain Image Fusion</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.705323</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to explore the feature recognition, diagnosis, and forecasting performances of Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VMs) for brain image fusion Digital Twins (DTs). Both unlabeled and labeled data are used regarding many unlabeled data in brain images, and semi supervised support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Meantime, the AlexNet model is improved, and the brain images in real space are mapped to virtual space by using digital twins. Moreover, a diagnosis and prediction model of brain image fusion digital twins based on semi supervised SVM and improved AlexNet is constructed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the Brain Tumor Department of a Hospital are collected to test the performance of the constructed model through simulation experiments. Some state-of-art models are included for performance comparison: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Results demonstrate that the proposed model can provide a feature recognition and extraction accuracy of 92.52%, at least an improvement of 2.76% compared to other models. Its training lasts for about 100 s, and the test takes about 0.68 s. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed model are 4.91 and 5.59%, respectively. Regarding the assessment indicators of brain image segmentation and fusion, the proposed model can provide a 79.55% Jaccard coefficient, a 90.43% Positive Predictive Value (PPV), a 73.09% Sensitivity, and a 75.58% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), remarkably better than other models. Acceleration efficiency analysis suggests that the improved AlexNet model is suitable for processing massive brain image data with a higher speedup indicator. To sum up, the constructed model can provide high accuracy, good acceleration efficiency, and excellent segmentation and recognition performances while ensuring low errors, which can provide an experimental basis for brain image feature recognition and digital diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Bioinformatic Analysis of the Proteome in Exosomes Derived From Plasma: Exosomes Involved in Cholesterol Metabolism Process of Patients With Spinal Cord Injury in the Acute Phase</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.662967</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common but severe disease caused by traffic accidents. Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD) caused by dyslipidemia is known as the leading cause of death in patients with SCI. However, the quantitative analysis showed that the cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations in peripheral blood (PB) did not change significantly within 48 h after SCI. Due to the presence of the Blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB), there are only few studies concerning the plasma cholesterol metabolism in the acute phase of SCI. Exosomes have a smaller particle size, which enables them relatively less limitation of BSCB. This study uses exosomes derived from the plasma of 43 patients in the acute phase of SCI and 71 patients in the control group as samples. MS proteomics and bioinformatics analysis found 590 quantifiable proteins, in which 75 proteins were upregulated and 153 proteins were downregulated, and the top 10 differentially expressed proteins are those including downregulating proteins: HIST1H4A, HIST2H3A, HIST2H2BE, HCLS1, S100A9, HIST1H2BM, S100A8, CALM3, YWHAH, and SFN, and upregulating proteins: SERPIND1, C1QB, SPTLC3, IGHV4-28, C4A, IGHV4-38-2, IGHV4-30-2, SLC15A1, C4B, and ACTG2. Enrichment analysis showed that the largest part of proteins was related to cholesterol metabolism among the downregulated proteins. The main components of cholesterol [ApoB-48 and ApoB-100 increased, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoA-IV, ApoC, ApoE, and Apo(a) decreased] were changed in exosomes derived from plasma of patients. ELISA analysis showed that some components were disordered in the acute phase of SCI. These results suggested that the exosomes might be involved in cholesterol metabolism regulation in the acute phase of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex differences in gut microbiota modulation of aversive conditioning, open field activity, and basolateral amygdala dendritic spine density</title>

	<description>Adult female and male C57BL/6N mice voluntarily consumed either a 10‐day course of antimicrobials or a control (tap water). Results showed that the antimicrobials exerted sex‐specific effects on gut microbiome structure, open field behavior, cued aversive learning, and amygdala dendritic spine density (Figure created in https://biorender.com/).

Abstract
Gut microbiota influence numerous aspects of host biology, including brain structure and function. Growing evidence implicates gut microbiota in aversive conditioning and anxiety‐related behaviors, but research has focused almost exclusively on males. To investigate whether effects of gut dysbiosis on aversive learning and memory differ by sex, adult female and male C57BL/6N mice were orally administered a moderate dose of nonabsorbable antimicrobial medications (ATMs: neomycin, bacitracin, and pimaricin) or a control over 10 days. Changes in gut microbiome composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Open field behavior, cued aversive learning, context recall, and cued recall were assessed. Following behavioral testing, the morphology of basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neuron dendrites and spines was characterized. Results revealed that ATMs induced gut dysbiosis in both sexes, with stronger effects in females. ATMs also exerted sex‐specific effects on behavior and neuroanatomy. Males were more susceptible than females to microbial modulation of locomotor activity and anxiety‐like behavior. Females were more susceptible than males to ATM‐induced impairments in aversive learning and cued recall. Context recall remained intact, as did dendritic structure of BLA principal neurons. However, ATMs exerted a sex‐specific effect on spine density. A second experiment was conducted to isolate the effects of gut perturbation to cued recall. Extinction was also examined. Results revealed no effect of ATMs on cued recall or extinction, suggesting that gut dysbiosis preferentially impacts aversive learning. These data shed new light on how gut microbiota interact with sex to influence aversive conditioning, open field behavior, and BLA dendritic spine architecture.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD), share a progressive and relentless course with increasing motor disability, linked with neuropsychiatric impairment. These diseases exhibit diverse pathophysiological processes and are a topic of intense experimental and clinical research due to the lack of therapeutic options. Restorative therapies are promising approaches with the potential to restore brain circuits. However, there were less compelling results in the few clinical trials. In this review, we discuss cell replacement therapies applied to animal models and HD patients. We thoroughly describe the initial trials using fetal neural tissue transplantation and recent approaches based on alternative cell sources tested in several animal models. Stem cells were shown to generate the desired neuron phenotype and/or provide growth factors to the degenerating host cells. Besides, genetic approaches such as RNA interference and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have been studied in animal models and human‐derived cells. New genetic manipulations have revealed the capability to control or counteract the effect of human gene mutations as described by the use of antisense oligonucleotides in a clinical trial. In HD, innovative strategies are at forefront of human testing and thus other brain genetic diseases may follow similar therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Modulation of stimulated dopamine release in rat nucleus accumbens shell by GABA in vitro: Effect of sub‐chronic phencyclidine pretreatment</title>

	<description>Using fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices in vitro, we showed an attenuation of electrically‐stimulated dopamine release by agonists at both GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptors. The attenuation by the baclofen was abolished in slices from animals pretreated with phencyclidine, modelling schizophrenia. 

Abstract
Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens (NAc) is modulated by γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors: dysregulation of GABAergic control of dopamine function may be important in behavioral deficits in schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptor agonists on electrically stimulated dopamine release. Furthermore, we explored whether drug‐induced changes were disrupted by pretreatment with phencyclidine, which provides a well‐validated model of schizophrenia. Using brain slices from female rats, fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release in NAc shell. Both muscimol and baclofen caused concentration‐dependent attenuation of evoked dopamine release: neither effect was changed by dihydro‐β‐erythroidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, or the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)‐type glutamate receptor antagonist, 6‐cyano‐7‐nitroquinoxaline‐2,3‐dione (CNQX), precluding indirect mechanisms using these transmitter systems in the GABAergic actions. In slices taken from rats pretreated with phencyclidine, the attenuation of evoked dopamine release by baclofen was abolished, but the attenuation by muscimol was unaffected. Since phencyclidine pretreatment was followed by drug‐free washout period of at least a week, the drug was not present during recording. Therefore, disruption of GABA‐B modulation of dopamine is due to long‐term functional changes resulting from the treatment, rather than transient changes due to the drug's presence at test. This enduring dysregulation of GABA‐B modulation of accumbal dopamine release provides a plausible mechanism through which GABA dysfunction influences accumbal dopamine leading to behavioral changes seen in schizophrenia and may provide a route for novel therapeutic strategies to treat the condition.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Effects of the combination therapy of electric field stimulation and polyethylene glycol in the ex vivo spinal cord of female rats after compression</title>

	<description>In the present study, the effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were determined in the compression model of ex vivo spinal cords by using a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC). The effects of the combination therapy are better than those of the individual treatments of PEG and EFS. The methods of establishing ex vivo spinal cord compression model in the DSGRC can be useful in the fundamental and the clinical applications of the spinal cord injury in future.

Abstract
The application of electric field stimulation (EFS) can reduce the cation influx after spinal cord injury. However, regenerated cation influx and reestablished injury potential are observed after EFS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is popular as an effective cell membrane fusion agent. This study aims to determine the effects of the combination therapy of EFS and PEG in the ex vivo spinal cord after compression. The ex vivo spinal cords of female rats with compression injury were incubated in a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC) and randomly divided into the following four groups: (1) compression group: compression only, (2) EFS group: EFS for 15 min, (3) PEG group: PEG treatment for 4 min, and (4) EFS + PEG group: EFS for 15 min and PEG treatment for 4 min. The hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed to measure the necrotic area of the spinal cords. The gap potential was detected, and the area under the curve of the gap potential was calculated. The intracellular cation concentration, membrane permeability, and compound action potential were measured and quantified. Results revealed no significant difference in the necrotic areas among different groups, and the compression model of the ex vivo spinal cord in the DSGRC had high consistency and stability. The combination therapy could attenuate cation inflow, promote cell membrane restoration, and promote the functional recovery of the spinal cord conduction after compression in ex vivo spinal cords.</description>

	<description>Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation‐associated elevated noradrenaline reduced neuronal‐branching and ‐spines, while synaptic‐length of active zones and ‐protein expressions showed compensatory increase. These changes offer possible cellular level explanation of behavioral effects. Consolidating these and previous findings suggest that REMS plays a crucial role in modulating brain noradrenaline, which affect neuronal plasticity in health and diseases. 

Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) favors brain development and memory, while it is decreased in neurodegenerative diseases. REMS deprivation (REMSD) affects several physiological processes including memory consolidation; however, its detailed mechanism(s) of action was unknown. REMS reduces, while REMSD elevates noradrenaline (NA) level in the brain; the latter induces several deficiencies and disorders, including changes in neuronal cytomorphology and apoptosis. Therefore, we proposed that REMS‐ and REMSD‐associated modulation of NA level might affect neuronal plasticity and affect brain functions. Male albino rats were REMS deprived by flower‐pot method for 6 days, and its effects were compared with home cage and large platform controls as well as post‐REMSD recovered and REMS‐deprived prazosin (α1‐adrenoceptor antagonist)‐treated rats. We observed that REMSD reduced CA1 and CA3 neuronal dendritic length, branching, arborization, and spine density, while length of active zone and expressions of pre‐ as well as post‐synaptic proteins were increased as compared to controls; interestingly, prazosin prevented most of the effects in vivo. Studies on primary culture of neurons from chick embryo brain confirmed that NA at lower concentration(s) induced neuronal branching and arborization, while higher doses were destructive. The findings support our contention that REMSD adversely affects neuronal plasticity, branching, and synaptic scaffold, which explain the underlying cytoarchitectural basis of REMSD‐associated patho‐physio‐behavioral changes. Consolidation of findings of this study along with that of our previous reports suggest that the neuronal disintegration could be due to either withdrawal of direct protective and proliferative role of low dose of NA or indirect effect of high dose of NA or both.</description>

	<description>Summary of the main results of the study.

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition, which leads to a permanent loss of functions below the injury site. The events which take place after SCI are characterized by cellular death, release of inhibitory factors, and inflammation. Many therapies have been studied to cure SCI, among them magnetic stimulation aims to reduce the secondary damages in particular by decreasing apoptosis, while, cellular transplantation promotes neuroregeneration by enhancing axonal regrowth. In the present study, we compared individually primary olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation and repetitive trans‐spinal magnetic stimulation (rTSMS) and then, we combined these two therapeutic approaches on tissue repair and functional recovery after SCI. To do so, SCIs were performed at Th10 level on female C57BL/6 mice, which were randomized into four groups: SCI, SCI + primary bOECs, SCI + STM, SCI + primary bulbar olfactory ensheathing cells (bOECs) + stimulation (STM). On these animals bioluminescence, immunohistological, and behavioral experiments were performed after SCI. Our results show that rTSMS has beneficial effect on the modulation of spinal scar by reducing fibrosis, demyelination, and microglial cell activation and by increasing the astroglial component of the scar, while, primary bOEC transplantation decreases microglial reactivity. At the opposite, locotronic experiments show that both treatments induce functional recovery. We did not observed any additional effect by combining the two therapeutic approaches. Taken together, the present study indicates that primary bOEC transplantation and rTSMS treatment act through different mechanisms after SCI to induce functional recovery. In our experimental paradigm, the combination of the two therapies does not induce any additional benefit.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Larger bilateral amygdalar volumes are associated with affective loss experiences</title>

	<description>Healthy young adults with affective loss (AL) experience showed larger bilateral amygdalar volumes compared to those without AL experiences. Our data suggest that AL engenders alterations in subcortical structures that likely involve processes of chronic stress and fear conditioning, and resemble those observed in general anxiety disorder, childhood maltreatment, and major depressive disorder.

Abstract
Affective loss (AL) (i.e., bereavement, relationship breakup) is a stressful life event leading to a heightened risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, for example, depression and anxiety disorder. These disorders have been associated with altered subcortical brain volumes. Little is known though, how AL in healthy subjects is linked to subcortical volumes. In a study with 196 healthy young adults, we probed the association between AL across the individual entire life span, assessed via the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire, and magnetic resonance imaging brain gray matter volumes (a priori selected: bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, thalami; exploratory analyses: nuclei accumbens, caudate, putamina), segmented by use of volBrain. AL was defined as death of a first‐degree relative/spouse, close relative/friend, and breakup of a marriage or steady relationship. AL was associated with larger bilateral amygdalar volumes and, after taking into account the total number of ALs, with smaller right hippocampal volumes, both irrespective of sex. Exploratory analyses of striatal volumes yielded an association of AL with larger right nucleus accumbens volumes in men, and increased caudate volumes after the loss of a first‐degree relative irrespective of sex. Our data suggest that AL engenders alterations in limbic structures that likely involve processes of chronic stress and amygdala‐ and hippocampus‐dependent fear conditioning, and resemble those observed in general anxiety disorder, childhood maltreatment, and major depressive disorder. Our exploratory findings of striatal volume alterations hint at a modulation of reward processing by AL.</description>

	<description>Electrical stimulation after traumatic brain injury increases population of anti‐inflammatory microglia, neural stem cells, and Nestin+ astrocytes.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by an external physical impact results in compromised brain function via undesired neuronal death. Following the injury, resident and peripheral immune cells, astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) cooperatively contribute to the recovery of the neuronal function after TBI. However, excessive pro‐inflammatory responses of immune cells, and the disappearance of endogenous NSCs at the injury site during the acute phase of TBI, can exacerbate TBI progression leading to incomplete healing. Therefore, positive outcomes may depend on early interventions to control the injury‐associated cellular milieu in the early phase of injury. Here, we explore electrical stimulation (ES) of the injury site in a rodent model (male Sprague–Dawley rats) to investigate its overall effect on the constituent brain cell phenotype and composition during the acute phase of TBI. Our data showed that a brief ES for 1 hr on day 2 of TBI promoted anti‐inflammatory phenotypes of microglia as assessed by CD206 expression and increased the population of NSCs and Nestin+ astrocytes at 7 days post‐TBI. Also, ES effectively increased the number of viable neurons when compared to the unstimulated control group. Given the salience of microglia and neural stem cells for healing after TBI, our results strongly support the potential benefit of the therapeutic use of ES during the acute phase of TBI to regulate neuroinflammation and to enhance neuroregeneration.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Enhanced synaptic properties of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus after learning a spatial working memory task in adult male mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24833</guid>

	<description>Male mice were trained either in the delayed alternation task (fully‐adapted) or the alternation task without any delays (partially‐adapted) for 9 days. The control group remained in their homecage for the same time. The fully adapted group exhibited improved cognitive flexibility, increased long‐term potentiation and dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and increased mature dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, compared ot the other two groups.

Abstract
Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold on‐line and manipulate information. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region involved in WM, while the hippocampus is also involved, particularly, in spatial WM. Although several studies have investigated the neuronal substrates of WM in trained animals, the effects and the mechanisms underlying learning WM tasks have not been explored. In our study, we investigated the effects of learning WM tasks in mice on the function of PFC and hippocampus, by training mice in the delayed alternation task for 9 days (adaptive group). This group was compared to naïve mice (which stayed in their homecage) and mice trained in the alternation procedure only (non‐adaptive). Following training, a cohort of mice (Experiment A) was tested in the left–right discrimination task and the reversal learning task, while another cohort (Experiment B) was tested in the attention set‐shifting task (AST). The adaptive group performed significantly better in the reversal learning task (Experiment A) and AST (Experiment B), compared to non‐adaptive and naïve groups. At the end of the behavioral experiments in Experiment A, field excitatory post‐synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in PFC and hippocampal brain slices. The adaptive group had enhanced the long‐term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC, compared to the other groups. In the hippocampus, both the adaptive and the non‐adaptive groups exhibited increased fEPSP compared to the naïve group, but no differences in LTP. In Experiment B, the dendritic spine density was measured, which, in the PFC, was found increased in the adaptive group, compared to the non‐adaptive and naïve groups. In the hippocampus, there was an increase in mature dendritic spine density in the adaptive group, compared to the other two groups. Our results indicate a role for LTP and dendritic spine density in learning WM tasks.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Previous findings on the relationship between prediabetes (the precursor stage of type 2 diabetes) and brain health in humans are inconsistent. Thus, this systematic review of cross‐sectional and longitudinal studies aimed to summarize what is currently known about brain deficits in prediabetic adults. Following the PRISMA reporting standards for systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive review of peer‐reviewed journal articles published from 2009 to present, focusing on studies that assessed brain volume, structural connectivity, and cerebrovascular health in prediabetic adults and older adults (i.e., 18 years or older). We systematically searched PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMbase databases. Quality assessment was based on the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational and Cross‐sectional Studies. In total, 19 studies were included in our review. Results from these studies show that prediabetes may be associated with deficits in brain structure and pathology, however, several studies also refute these findings. Moreover, we identified clear inconsistencies in study methodologies, including diabetes measures and classification, across studies that may account for these conflicting findings.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hankyu Jang, Philip M. Polgreen, Alberto M. Segre, Sriram V. Pemmaraju&lt;/p&gt;

This paper describes a data-driven simulation study that explores the relative impact of several low-cost and practical non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in an outpatient hospital dialysis unit. The interventions considered include: (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) voluntary self-isolation of healthcare personnel (HCPs) with symptoms; (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) a program of active syndromic surveillance and compulsory isolation of HCPs; (&lt;i&gt;iii&lt;/i&gt;) the use of masks or respirators by patients and HCPs; (&lt;i&gt;iv&lt;/i&gt;) improved social distancing among HCPs; (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) increased physical separation of dialysis stations; and (&lt;i&gt;vi&lt;/i&gt;) patient isolation combined with preemptive isolation of exposed HCPs. Our simulations show that under conditions that existed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, extremely high rates of COVID-19 infection can result in a dialysis unit. In simulations under worst-case modeling assumptions, a combination of relatively inexpensive interventions such as requiring surgical masks for everyone, encouraging social distancing between healthcare professionals (HCPs), slightly increasing the physical distance between dialysis stations, and—once the first symptomatic patient is detected—isolating that patient, replacing the HCP having had the most exposure to that patient, and relatively short-term use of N95 respirators by other HCPs can lead to a substantial reduction in both the attack rate and the likelihood of any spread beyond patient zero. For example, in a scenario with &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.0, 60% presymptomatic viral shedding, and a dialysis patient being the infection source, the attack rate falls from 87.8% at baseline to 34.6% with this intervention bundle. Furthermore, the likelihood of having no additional infections increases from 6.2% at baseline to 32.4% with this intervention bundle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TjNKLwlyb8U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Human EEG and Recurrent Neural Networks Exhibit Common Temporal Dynamics During Speech Recognition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent deep-learning artificial neural networks have shown remarkable success in recognizing natural human speech, however the reasons for their success are not entirely understood. Success of these methods might be because state-of-the-art networks use recurrent layers or dilated convolutional layers that enable the network to use a time-dependent feature space. The importance of time-dependent features in human cortical mechanisms of speech perception, measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have also been of particular recent interest. It is possible that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) achieve their success by emulating aspects of cortical dynamics, albeit through very different computational mechanisms. In that case, we should observe commonalities in the temporal dynamics of deep-learning models, particularly in recurrent layers, and brain electrical activity (EEG) during speech perception. We explored this prediction by presenting the same sentences to both human listeners and the Deep Speech RNN and considered the temporal dynamics of the EEG and RNN units for identical sentences. We tested whether the recently discovered phenomenon of envelope phase tracking in the human EEG is also evident in RNN hidden layers. We furthermore predicted that the clustering of dissimilarity between model representations of pairs of stimuli would be similar in both RNN and EEG dynamics. We found that the dynamics of both the recurrent layer of the network and human EEG signals exhibit envelope phase tracking with similar time lags. We also computed the representational distance matrices (RDMs) of brain and network responses to speech stimuli. The model RDMs became more similar to the brain RDM when going from early network layers to later ones, and eventually peaked at the recurrent layer. These results suggest that the Deep Speech RNN captures a representation of temporal features of speech in a manner similar to human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Harnessing the Activation of RIG-I Like Receptors to Inhibit Glioblastoma Tumorigenesis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GB) is an incurable form of brain malignancy in an adult with a median survival of less than 15 months. The current standard of care, which consists of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, has been unsuccessful due to an extensive inter- and intra-tumoral genetic and molecular heterogeneity. This aspect represents a serious obstacle for developing alternative therapeutic options for GB. In the last years, immunotherapy has emerged as an effective treatment for a wide range of cancers and several trials have evaluated its effects in GB patients. Unfortunately, clinical outcomes were disappointing particularly because of the presence of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Recently, anti-cancer approaches aimed to improve the expression and the activity of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) have emerged. These innovative therapeutic strategies attempt to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses against tumor antigens and to promote the apoptosis of cancer cells. Indeed, RLRs are important mediators of the innate immune system by triggering the type I interferon (IFN) response upon recognition of immunostimulatory RNAs. In this mini-review, we discuss the functions of RLRs family members in the control of immune response and we focus on the potential clinical application of RLRs agonists as a promising strategy for GB therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) contain specialized tethering proteins that bind both ER and PM membranes. In excitable cells, ER–PM contacts play an important role in calcium signaling and transferring lipids. Junctophilins are a conserved family of ER–PM tethering proteins. They are predominantly expressed in muscles and neurons and known to simultaneously bind both ER- and PM-localized ion channels. Since their discovery two decades ago, functional studies using junctophilin-deficient animals have provided a deep understanding of their roles in muscles and neurons, including excitation-contraction coupling, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), and afterhyperpolarization (AHP). In this review, we highlight key findings from mouse, fly, and worm that support evolutionary conservation of junctophilins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Spatial RNA Sequencing Identifies Robust Markers of Vulnerable and Resistant Human Midbrain Dopamine Neurons and Their Expression in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Defining transcriptional profiles of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons is critical to understanding their differential vulnerability in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Here, we determine transcriptomes of human SNc and VTA dopamine neurons using LCM-seq on a large sample cohort. We apply a bootstrapping strategy as sample input to DESeq2 and identify 33 stably differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two subpopulations. We also compute a minimal sample size for identification of stable DEGs, which highlights why previous reported profiles from small sample sizes display extensive variability. Network analysis reveal gene interactions unique to each subpopulation and highlight differences in regulation of mitochondrial stability, apoptosis, neuronal survival, cytoskeleton regulation, extracellular matrix modulation as well as synapse integrity, which could explain the relative resilience of VTA dopamine neurons. Analysis of PD tissues showed that while identified stable DEGs can distinguish the subpopulations also in disease, the SNc markers SLIT1 and ATP2A3 were down-regulated and thus appears to be biomarkers of disease. In summary, our study identifies human SNc and VTA marker profiles, which will be instrumental for studies aiming to modulate dopamine neuron resilience and to validate cell identity of stem cell-derived dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Spatiotemporal Regulation of Transcript Isoform Expression in the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proper development and plasticity of hippocampal neurons require specific RNA isoforms to be expressed in the right place at the right time. Precise spatiotemporal transcript regulation requires the incorporation of essential regulatory RNA sequences into expressed isoforms. In this review, we describe several RNA processing strategies utilized by hippocampal neurons to regulate the spatiotemporal expression of genes critical to development and plasticity. The works described here demonstrate how the hippocampus is an ideal investigative model for uncovering alternate isoform-specific mechanisms that restrict the expression of transcripts in space and time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Estimating the Minimal Number of Repeated Examinations for Random Responsiveness With the Coma Recovery Scale—Revised as an Example</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.685627</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.685627</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a general method to estimate the minimal number of repeated examinations needed to detect patients with random responsiveness, given a limited rate of missed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Basic statistical theory was applied to develop the method. As an application, 100 patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) were assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R). DOC patients were supposed to be examined for 13 times over 20 days, while anyone who was diagnosed as a minimally conscious state (MCS) in a round would no longer be examined in the subsequent rounds. To test the validation of this method, a series of the stochastic simulation was completed by computer software under all the conditions of possible combinations of three kinds of distributions for p, five values of p, and four sizes of the sample and repeated for 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A series of formula was developed to estimate the probability of a positive response to a single examination given by a patient and the minimal number of successive examinations needed based on the numbers of patients detected in the first i (i =1, 2,.) rounds of repeated examinations. As applied to the DOC patients assessed with the CRS-R, with a rate of missed diagnosis &amp;lt; 0.0001, the estimate of the minimal number of examinations was six in traumatic brain injury patients and five in non-traumatic brain injury patients. The outcome of the simulation showed that this method performed well under various conditions possibly occurring in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: The method developed in this paper holds in theory and works well in application and stochastic simulation. It could be applied to any other kind of examinations for random responsiveness, not limited to CRS-R for detecting MCS; this should be validated in further research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Gray Matter Volume and Functional Connectivity in Patients With Vestibular Migraine</title>

	<description>Subjects&lt;p&gt;Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common neurological cause of vertigo in adults. Previous neuroimaging studies have reported structural alterations in areas associated with pain and vestibular processing. However, it is unclear whether altered resting-state functional connectivity (FC) exists in brain regions with structural abnormalities in patients with VM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional T1-weighed MRI were performed in 30 patients with VM and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Patients underwent an evaluation of migraine and dizziness severity. FC and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed using DPABI 4.3 and CAT12, respectively. The association between changes in gray matter (GM) volume or FC and clinical parameters was also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HCs, patients with VM demonstrated a reduced GM volume in the bilateral parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC), right middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus. The GM volume of the left PIVC was negatively associated with Dizziness Handicap Inventory score in patients with VM. Taking this region as a seed region, we further observed increased FC between the left primary somatosensory cortex (S1)/inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the left PIVC in patients with VM.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;FC between regions with a decline in GM volume (the PIVC and S1/IPL) is altered in patients with VM, suggesting that abnormalities in vestibular cortical network could be useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms of VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Characterization and Stage-Dependent Lineage Analysis of Intermediate Progenitors of Cortical GABAergic Interneurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intermediate progenitors of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which can replenish neurons in the adult brain, were recently identified. However, the generation of intermediate progenitors of GABAergic inhibitory neurons (IPGNs) has not been studied in detail. Here, we characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of IPGNs in mouse cerebral cortex. IPGNs generated neurons during both embryonic and postnatal stages, but the embryonic IPGNs were more proliferative. Our lineage tracing analyses showed that the embryonically proliferating IPGNs tended to localize to the superficial layers rather than the deep cortical layers at 3 weeks after birth. We also found that embryonic IPGNs derived from the medial and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) but more than half of the embryonic IPGNs were derived from the CGE and broadly distributed in the cerebral cortex. Taken together, our data indicate that the broadly located IPGNs during embryonic and postnatal stages exhibit a different proliferative property and layer distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Mind Causality: A Computational Neuroscience Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.706505</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.706505</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A neuroscience-based approach has recently been proposed for the relation between the mind and the brain. The proposal is that events at the sub-neuronal, neuronal, and neuronal network levels take place simultaneously to perform a computation that can be described at a high level as a mental state, with content about the world. It is argued that as the processes at the different levels of explanation take place at the same time, they are linked by a non-causal supervenient relationship: causality can best be described in brains as operating within but not between levels. This mind-brain theory allows mental events to be different in kind from the mechanistic events that underlie them; but does not lead one to argue that mental events cause brain events, or vice versa: they are different levels of explanation of the operation of the computational system. Here, some implications are developed. It is proposed that causality, at least as it applies to the brain, should satisfy three conditions. First, interventionist tests for causality must be satisfied. Second, the causally related events should be at the same level of explanation. Third, a temporal order condition must be satisfied, with a suitable time scale in the order of 10 ms (to exclude application to quantum physics; and a cause cannot follow an effect). Next, although it may be useful for different purposes to describe causality involving the mind and brain at the mental level, or at the brain level, it is argued that the brain level may sometimes be more accurate, for sometimes causal accounts at the mental level may arise from confabulation by the mentalee, whereas understanding exactly what computations have occurred in the brain that result in a choice or action will provide the correct causal account for why a choice or action was made. Next, it is argued that possible cases of “downward causation” can be accounted for by a within-levels-of-explanation account of causality. This computational neuroscience approach provides an opportunity to proceed beyond Cartesian dualism and physical reductionism in considering the relations between the mind and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Discrete Dynamics of Dynamic Neural Fields</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large and small cortexes of the brain are known to contain vast amounts of neurons that interact with one another. They thus form a continuum of active neural networks whose dynamics are yet to be fully understood. One way to model these activities is to use dynamic neural fields which are mathematical models that approximately describe the behavior of these congregations of neurons. These models have been used in neuroinformatics, neuroscience, robotics, and network analysis to understand not only brain functions or brain diseases, but also learning and brain plasticity. In their theoretical forms, they are given as ordinary or partial differential equations with or without diffusion. Many of their mathematical properties are still under-studied. In this paper, we propose to analyze discrete versions dynamic neural fields based on nearly exact discretization schemes techniques. In particular, we will discuss conditions for the stability of nontrivial solutions of these models, based on various types of kernels and corresponding parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are given for illustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Medial Septum as a Potential Target for Treating Brain Disorders Associated With Oscillopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.701080</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.701080</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial septum (MS), as part of the basal forebrain, supports many physiological functions, from sensorimotor integration to cognition. With often reciprocal connections with a broad set of peers at all major divisions of the brain, the MS orchestrates oscillatory neuronal activities throughout the brain. These oscillations are critical in generating sensory and emotional salience, locomotion, maintaining mood, supporting innate anxiety, and governing learning and memory. Accumulating evidence points out that the physiological oscillations under septal influence are frequently disrupted or altered in pathological conditions. Therefore, the MS may be a potential target for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders with abnormal oscillations (oscillopathies) to restore healthy patterns or erase undesired ones. Recent studies have revealed that the patterned stimulation of the MS alleviates symptoms of epilepsy. We discuss here that stimulus timing is a critical determinant of treatment efficacy on multiple time scales. On-demand stimulation may dramatically reduce side effects by not interfering with normal physiological functions. A precise pattern-matched stimulation through adaptive timing governed by the ongoing oscillations is essential to effectively terminate pathological oscillations. The time-targeted strategy for the MS stimulation may provide an effective way of treating multiple disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety/fear, schizophrenia, and depression, as well as pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Online Learning and Memory of Neural Trajectory Replays for Prefrontal Persistent and Dynamic Representations in the Irregular Asynchronous State</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), higher-order cognitive functions and adaptive flexible behaviors rely on continuous dynamical sequences of spiking activity that constitute neural trajectories in the state space of activity. Neural trajectories subserve diverse representations, from explicit mappings in physical spaces to generalized mappings in the task space, and up to complex abstract transformations such as working memory, decision-making and behavioral planning. Computational models have separately assessed learning and replay of neural trajectories, often using unrealistic learning rules or decoupling simulations for learning from replay. Hence, the question remains open of how neural trajectories are learned, memorized and replayed online, with permanently acting biological plasticity rules. The asynchronous irregular regime characterizing cortical dynamics in awake conditions exerts a major source of disorder that may jeopardize plasticity and replay of locally ordered activity. Here, we show that a recurrent model of local PFC circuitry endowed with realistic synaptic spike timing-dependent plasticity and scaling processes can learn, memorize and replay large-size neural trajectories online under asynchronous irregular dynamics, at regular or fast (sped-up) timescale. Presented trajectories are quickly learned (within seconds) as synaptic engrams in the network, and the model is able to chunk overlapping trajectories presented separately. These trajectory engrams last long-term (dozen hours) and trajectory replays can be triggered over an hour. In turn, we show the conditions under which trajectory engrams and replays preserve asynchronous irregular dynamics in the network. Functionally, spiking activity during trajectory replays at regular timescale accounts for both dynamical coding with temporal tuning in individual neurons, persistent activity at the population level, and large levels of variability consistent with observed cognitive-related PFC dynamics. Together, these results offer a consistent theoretical framework accounting for how neural trajectories can be learned, memorized and replayed in PFC networks circuits to subserve flexible dynamic representations and adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NLRP3 Inflammasome: A Potential Target in Isoflurane Pretreatment Alleviates Stroke-Induced Retinal Injury in Diabetes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke remains a devastating disease which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Visual impairment after stroke is a common complication which may lead to vision loss, greatly impacting life quality of patients. While ischemic stroke is traditionally characterized by a blockage of blood flow to the brain, this may coincide with reduced blood flow to the eye, resulting in retinal ischemia and leading to visual impairment. Diabetes increases the risk of ischemic stroke and induces diabetic retinopathy; the latter may be more sensitive to the ischemic retinal injury. In diabetic status, the underlying mechanism in stroke-induced retinal injury has not been fully clarified. The NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is an important activator of inflammation, which may play a critical role in catalyzing and forming certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cerebral and retinal ischemia. Isoflurane has been demonstrated to inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and show neuroprotective effects. In this study, we established a diabetic mouse model and performed the middle cerebral artery occlusion procedure to induce ischemic stroke. Our results revealed that cerebral ischemia-induced retinal injury in the diabetic model. Isoflurane pretreatment alleviated the cerebral and retinal injury after ischemic stroke. Of note, isoflurane pretreatment inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the retina, indicating that isoflurane pretreatment may provide substantial retinal protection in stroke-induced retinal injury in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The transcription factor LAG-1/CSL plays a Notch-independent role in controlling terminal differentiation, fate maintenance, and plasticity of serotonergic chemosensory neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Miren Maicas, Ángela Jimeno-Martín, Andrea Millán-Trejo, Mark J. Alkema, Nuria Flames&lt;/p&gt;

During development, signal-regulated transcription factors (TFs) act as basal repressors and upon signalling through morphogens or cell-to-cell signalling shift to activators, mediating precise and transient responses. Conversely, at the final steps of neuron specification, terminal selector TFs directly initiate and maintain neuron-type specific gene expression through enduring functions as activators. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; contains 3 types of serotonin synthesising neurons that share the expression of the serotonin biosynthesis pathway genes but not of other effector genes. Here, we find an unconventional role for LAG-1, the signal-regulated TF mediator of the Notch pathway, as terminal selector for the ADF serotonergic chemosensory neuron, but not for other serotonergic neuron types. Regulatory regions of ADF effector genes contain functional LAG-1 binding sites that mediate activation but not basal repression. &lt;i&gt;lag-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants show broad defects in ADF effector genes activation, and LAG-1 is required to maintain ADF cell fate and functions throughout life. Unexpectedly, contrary to reported basal repression state for LAG-1 prior to Notch receptor activation, gene expression activation in the ADF neuron by LAG-1 does not require Notch signalling, demonstrating a default activator state for LAG-1 independent of Notch. We hypothesise that the enduring activity of terminal selectors on target genes required uncoupling LAG-1 activating role from receiving the transient Notch signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DCDTa1kmEI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Leukotriene B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is secreted by chemotactic neutrophils, forming a secondary gradient that amplifies the reach of primary chemoattractants. This strategy increases the recruitment range for neutrophils and is important during inflammation. Here, we show that LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its synthesizing enzymes localize to intracellular multivesicular bodies, which, upon stimulation, release their content as exosomes. Purified exosomes can activate resting neutrophils and elicit chemotactic activity in an LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-dependent manner. Inhibition of exosome release leads to loss of directional motility with concomitant loss of LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; release. Our findings establish that the exosomal pool of LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acts in an autocrine fashion to sensitize neutrophils towards the primary chemoattractant, and in a paracrine fashion to mediate the recruitment of neighboring neutrophils in trans. We envision that this mechanism is used by other signals to foster communication between cells in harsh extracellular environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3JgRrfCI9GI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sensory perception of environmental cues as a modulator of aging and neurodegeneration: Insights from Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>Abstract
Environmental stimuli such as temperature, food, and smell significantly influence the physiology and behavior of animals. Animals are differentially adapted to maintain their internal body functions in response to varied environmental conditions. These external cues are sensed by specialized neurons which are a part of the chemosensory and thermosensory systems. The inability to respond correctly to varied environmental conditions may result in compromised bodily functions and reduced longevity. For example, the ability to sense food is derived from the integrated action of olfactory and gustatory systems. The damage to the olfactory system will affect our decision of palatable food items which in turn can affect the response of the gustatory system, ultimately causing abnormal feeding habits. Recent studies have provided evidence that aging is regulated by sensory perception of environment. Aging is one of the most common causes of various neurodegenerative diseases and the perception of environmental cues is also found to regulate the development of neurodegenerative phenotype in several animal models. However, specific molecular signaling pathways involved in the process are not completely understood. The research conducted on one of the best‐studied animal models of aging, Caenorhabditis elegans, has demonstrated multiple examples of gene–environment interaction at the neuronal level which affects life span. The findings may be useful to identify the key neuronal regulators of aging and age‐related diseases in humans owing to conserved core metabolic and aging pathways from worms to humans.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Automated annotation of epileptiform burden and its association with outcomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26161</guid>

	<description>Objective
To determine the dose‐response relation between epileptiform activity burden and outcomes in acutely ill patients.


Methods
Single center retrospective analysis of 1967 neurologic, medical and surgical patients who underwent &amp;gt; 16 hours of continuous EEG between 2011‐2017. We developed an AI algorithm to annotate 11.02 terabytes of EEG and quantify epileptiform activity burden within 72 hours of recording. We evaluated burden in 1) the first 24 hours of recording, 2) the 12‐hr epoch with highest burden (peak burden), and 3) cumulative through the first 72 hours of monitoring. Machine learning was applied to estimate the effect of epileptiform burden on outcome. Outcome measure was discharge modified Rankin Scale, dichotomized as good (0‐4) vs. poor (5‐6).


Results
Peak epileptiform burden was independently associated with poor outcomes (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Other independent associations included age, APACHE II, seizure on presentation, and diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Model calibration error was calculated across three strata based on the time interval between last EEG measurement (up to 72 hours of monitoring) and discharge: 1) &amp;lt; 5 days between last measurement and discharge: 0.0941 [CI 0.0706, 0.1191); 5‐10 days between last measurement and discharge: 0.0946 [CI 0.0631, 0.1290]; &amp;gt; 10 days between last measurement and discharge: 0.0998 [CI 0.0698, 0.1335]. After adjusting for covariates, increase in peak epileptiform activity burden from 0% to 100% increased the probability of poor outcome by 35%.


Interpretation
Automated measurement of peak epileptiform activity burden affords a convenient, consistent, and quantifiable target for future multi‐center randomized trials investigating whether suppressing epileptiform activity improves outcomes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurology Grand Rounds: Changing gears – DBS for dopaminergic desensitization in Parkinson's disease?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26164</guid>

	<description>In Parkinson’s disease, both motor and neuropsychiatric complications unfold as consequence of both incremental striatal dopaminergic denervation and intensifying long‐term dopaminergic treatment. Together, this leads to ‘dopaminergic sensitization’ steadily increasing motor and behavioral responses to dopaminergic medication that result in the detrimental sequalae of long‐term dopaminergic treatment. We review the clinical presentations of ‘dopaminergic sensitization’, including rebound off and dyskinesia in the motor domain, and neuropsychiatric fluctuations and behavioral addictions with impulse control disorders and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in the neuropsychiatric domain. We summarize state‐of‐the‐art deep brain stimulation, and show that STN‐DBS allows dopaminergic medication to be tapered, thus supporting dopaminergic desensitization. In this framework, we develop our integrated debatable viewpoint of “changing gears”, i.e., we suggest rethinking earlier use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, when the first clinical signs of dopaminergic motor or neuropsychiatric complications emerge over the steadily progressive disease course. In this sense, subthalamic deep brain stimulation may help reduce longitudinal motor and neuropsychiatric symptom expression – importantly, not by neuroprotection but by supporting dopaminergic desensitization through postoperative medication reduction. Therefore, we suggest considering STN‐DBS early enough before patients encounter potentially irreversible psychosocial consequences of dopaminergic complications, but importantly not before a patient shows first clinical signs of dopaminergic complications. We propose to consider neuropsychiatric dopaminergic complications as a new inclusion criterion in addition to established motor criteria, but this concept will require validation in future clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MRI Correlates of Multiple Sclerosis Immunopathological Patterns</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26163</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26163?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Histology reveals that early active multiple sclerosis lesions can be classified into three main inter‐individually heterogeneous but intra‐individually stable immunopathological patterns of active demyelination (patterns I‐III). In pattern I and II, a T‐cell‐ and macrophage‐associated demyelination is suggested, with pattern II only showing signs of a humoral immune response. Pattern III is characterized by inflammatory lesions with an oligodendrocyte degeneration. Patterns suggest pathogenic heterogeneity, and we postulated that they have distinct MRI correlates that may serve as biomarkers.


Methods
We evaluated in an international collaborative retrospective cohort study the MRI lesion characteristics of 789 conventional pre‐biopsy and follow‐up MRIs in relation to their histopathologically classified immunpathological patterns (n=161 subjects) and lesion edge features (n=112).


Results
A strong association of a ring‐like enhancement and a hypointense T2‐weighted rim (T2w rim) with pattern I and II, but not pattern III, was observed. Only a fraction of pattern III patients showed a ring‐like enhancement, and this was always atypical. Ring‐like enhancement and T2w rims colocalized, and ring‐like enhancement showed a strong association with macrophage rims as shown by histology. A strong concordance of MRI lesion characteristics, meaning that different lesions showed the same features, was found when comparing biopsied and non‐biopsied lesions at a given time point, indicating lesion homogeneity within individual patients.


Interpretation
We provide robust evidence that MRI characteristics reflect specific morphological features of MS immunopatterns and that ring‐like enhancement and T2w hypointense rims might serve as a valuable non‐invasive biomarker to differentiate pathological patterns of demyelination.
