	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main success stories of deep learning, starting with ImageNet, depend on
convolutional networks, which on certain tasks perform significantly better
than traditional shallow classifiers, such as support vector machines. Is there
something special about deep convolutional networks that other learning
machines do not possess? Recent results in approximation theory have shown that
there is an exponential advantage of deep convolutional-like networks in
approximating functions with hierarchical locality in their compositional
structure. These mathematical results, however, do not say which tasks are
expected to have input-output functions with hierarchical locality. Among all
the possible hierarchically local tasks in vision, text and speech we explore a
few of them experimentally by studying how they are affected by disrupting
locality in the input images. We also discuss a taxonomy of tasks ranging from
local, to hierarchically local, to global and make predictions about the type
of networks required to perform efficiently on these different types of tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Element-wise activation functions play a critical role in deep neural
networks by affecting the expressivity power and the learning dynamics.
Learning-based activation functions have recently gained increasing attention
and success. We propose a new perspective of learnable activation function
through formulating them with element-wise attention mechanism. In each network
layer, we devise an attention module which learns an element-wise, sign-based
attention map for the pre-activation feature map. The attention map scales an
element based on its sign. Adding the attention module with a rectified linear
unit (ReLU) results in an amplification of positive elements and a suppression
of negative ones, both with learned, data-adaptive parameters. We coin the
resulting activation function Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit (AReLU).
The attention module essentially learns an element-wise residue of the
activated part of the input, as ReLU can be viewed as an identity
transformation. This makes the network training more resistant to gradient
vanishing. The learned attentive activation leads to well-focused activation of
relevant regions of a feature map. Through extensive evaluations, we show that
AReLU significantly boosts the performance of most mainstream network
architectures with only two extra learnable parameters per layer introduced.
Notably, AReLU facilitates fast network training under small learning rates,
which makes it especially suited in the case of transfer learning. Our source
code has been released (https://github.com/densechen/AReLU).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progress in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms goes hand-in-hand with the
development of challenging environments that test the limits of current
methods. While existing RL environments are either sufficiently complex or
based on fast simulation, they are rarely both. Here, we present the NetHack
Learning Environment (NLE), a scalable, procedurally generated, stochastic,
rich, and challenging environment for RL research based on the popular
single-player terminal-based roguelike game, NetHack. We argue that NetHack is
sufficiently complex to drive long-term research on problems such as
exploration, planning, skill acquisition, and language-conditioned RL, while
dramatically reducing the computational resources required to gather a large
amount of experience. We compare NLE and its task suite to existing
alternatives, and discuss why it is an ideal medium for testing the robustness
and systematic generalization of RL agents. We demonstrate empirical success
for early stages of the game using a distributed Deep RL baseline and Random
Network Distillation exploration, alongside qualitative analysis of various
agents trained in the environment. NLE is open source at
https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, with the advance of technology, there is an increasing amount of
unstructured data being generated every day. However, it is a painful job to
label and organize it. Labeling is an expensive, time-consuming, and difficult
task. It is usually done manually, which collaborates with the incorporation of
noise and errors to the data. Hence, it is of great importance to developing
intelligent models that can benefit from both labeled and unlabeled data.
Currently, works on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are still being
overshadowed by the successes of purely supervised learning. However, it is
expected that they become far more important in the longer term. This article
presents a semi-supervised model, called Batch Semi-Supervised Self-Organizing
Map (Batch SS-SOM), which is an extension of a SOM incorporating some advances
that came with the rise of Deep Learning, such as batch training. The results
show that Batch SS-SOM is a good option for semi-supervised classification and
clustering. It performs well in terms of accuracy and clustering error, even
with a small number of labeled samples, as well as when presented to
unsupervised data, and shows competitive results in transfer learning scenarios
in traditional image classification benchmark datasets.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Crossmodal Language Grounding in an Embodied Neurocognitive Model. (arXiv:2006.13546v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human infants are able to acquire natural language seemingly easily at an
early age. Their language learning seems to occur simultaneously with learning
other cognitive functions as well as with playful interactions with the
environment and caregivers. From a neuroscientific perspective, natural
language is embodied, grounded in most, if not all, sensory and sensorimotor
modalities, and acquired by means of crossmodal integration. However,
characterising the underlying mechanisms in the brain is difficult and
explaining the grounding of language in crossmodal perception and action
remains challenging. In this paper, we present a neurocognitive model for
language grounding which reflects bio-inspired mechanisms such as an implicit
adaptation of timescales as well as end-to-end multimodal abstraction. It
addresses developmental robotic interaction and extends its learning
capabilities using larger-scale knowledge-based data. In our scenario, we
utilise the humanoid robot NICO in obtaining the EMIL data collection, in which
the cognitive robot interacts with objects in a children's playground
environment while receiving linguistic labels from a caregiver. The model
analysis shows that crossmodally integrated representations are sufficient for
acquiring language merely from sensory input through interaction with objects
in an environment. The representations self-organise hierarchically and embed
temporal and spatial information through composition and decomposition. This
model can also provide the basis for further crossmodal integration of
perceptually grounded cognitive representations.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: An approach to synaptic learning for autonomous motor control. (arXiv:2006.13471v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13471</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the realm of motor control, artificial agents cannot match the performance
of their biological counterparts. We thus explore a neural control architecture
that is both biologically plausible, and capable of fully autonomous learning.
The architecture consists of feedback controllers that learn to achieve a
desired state by selecting the errors that should drive them. This selection
happens through a family of differential Hebbian learning rules that, through
interaction with the environment, can learn to control systems where the error
responds monotonically to the control signal. We next show that in a more
general case, neural reinforcement learning can be coupled with a feedback
controller to reduce errors that arise non-monotonically from the control
signal. The use of feedback control reduces the complexity of the reinforcement
learning problem, because only a desired value must be learned, with the
controller handling the details of how it is reached. This makes the function
to be learned simpler, potentially allowing to learn more complex actions. We
discuss how this approach could be extended to hierarchical architectures.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent works show that overparameterized networks contain small subnetworks
that exhibit comparable accuracy to the full model when trained in isolation.
These results highlight the potential to reduce training costs of deep neural
networks without sacrificing generalization performance. However, existing
approaches for finding these small networks rely on expensive multi-round
train-and-prune procedures and are non-practical for large data sets and
models. In this paper, we show how to find small networks that exhibit the same
performance as their overparameterized counterparts after only a few training
epochs. We find that hidden layer activations in overparameterized networks
exist primarily in subspaces smaller than the actual model width. Building on
this observation, we use PCA to find a basis of high variance for layer inputs
and represent layer weights using these directions. We eliminate all weights
not relevant to the found PCA basis and term these network architectures
Principal Component Networks. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, we show that PCNs train
faster and use less energy than overparameterized models, without accuracy
loss. We find that our transformation leads to networks with up to 23.8x fewer
parameters, with equal or higher end-model accuracy---in some cases we observe
improvements up to 3%. We also show that ResNet-20 PCNs outperform deep
ResNet-110 networks while training faster.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study learning of recurrent neural networks that produce temporal
sequences consisting of the concatenation of re-usable &quot;motifs&quot;. In the context
of neuroscience or robotics, these motifs would be the motor primitives from
which complex behavior is generated. Given a known set of motifs, can a new
motif be learned without affecting the performance of the known set and then
used in new sequences without first explicitly learning every possible
transition? Two requirements enable this: (i) parameter updates while learning
a new motif do not interfere with the parameters used for the previously
acquired ones; and (ii) a new motif can be robustly generated when starting
from the network state reached at the end of any of the other motifs, even if
that state was not present during training. We meet the first requirement by
investigating artificial neural networks (ANNs) with specific architectures,
and attempt to meet the second by training them to generate motifs from random
initial states. We find that learning of single motifs succeeds but that
sequence generation is not robust: transition failures are observed. We then
compare these results with a model whose architecture and
analytically-tractable dynamics are inspired by the motor thalamocortical
circuit, and that includes a specific module used to implement motif
transitions. The synaptic weights of this model can be adjusted without
requiring stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simulated network outputs,
and we have asymptotic guarantees that transitions will not fail. Indeed, in
simulations, we achieve single-motif accuracy on par with the previously
studied ANNs and have improved sequencing robustness with no transition
failures. Finally, we show that insights obtained by studying the transition
subnetwork of this model can also improve the robustness of transitioning in
the traditional ANNs previously studied.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an open and challenging problem in
machine learning. While NAS offers great promise, the prohibitive computational
demand of most of the existing NAS methods makes it difficult to directly
search the architectures on large-scale tasks. The typical way of conducting
large scale NAS is to search for an architectural building block on a small
dataset (either using a proxy set from the large dataset or a completely
different small scale dataset) and then transfer the block to a larger dataset.
Despite a number of recent results that show the promise of transfer from proxy
datasets, a comprehensive evaluation of different NAS methods studying the
impact of different source datasets and training protocols has not yet been
addressed. In this work, we propose to analyze the architecture transferability
of different NAS methods by performing a series of experiments on large scale
benchmarks such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet22K. We find that: (i) On average,
transfer performance of architectures searched using completely different small
datasets perform similarly to the architectures searched directly on proxy
target datasets. However, design of proxy sets has considerable impact on
rankings of different NAS methods. (ii) While the different NAS methods show
similar performance on a source dataset (e.g., CIFAR10), they significantly
differ on the transfer performance to a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet1K). (iii)
Even on large datasets, the randomly sampled architecture baseline is very
competitive and significantly outperforms many representative NAS methods. (iv)
The training protocol has a larger impact on small datasets, but it fails to
provide consistent improvements on large datasets. We believe that our
NASTransfer benchmark will be key to designing future NAS strategies that
consistently show superior transfer performance on large scale datasets.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Long-Term therapeutic effects of Katona therapy in moderate-to-severe perinatal brain damage. (arXiv:2006.13290v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13290</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13290</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aim: To determine the long-term efficacy of Katona therapy and early
rehabilitation of infants with moderate-to-severe perinatal brain damage (PBD).
Methods: Thirty-two participants were recruited (7-to-16 years) and divided
into 3 groups: one Healthy group (n = 11), one group with PBD treated with
Katona methodology from 2 months of corrected age, and with long-term follow-up
(n = 12), and one group with PBD but without treatment in the first year of
life due to late diagnosis of PBD (n = 9). Neuropediatric evaluations, motor
evoked potentials (MEPs) and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were made. The PBD
groups were matched by severity and topography of lesion. Results: The patients
treated with Katona had better motor performance when compared to patients
without early treatment (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels; 75%
of Katona group were classified in levels I and II and 78% of patients without
early treatment were classified in levels III and IV). Furthermore, independent
k-means cluster analyses of MRI, MEPs, and neuropediatric evaluations data were
performed. Katona and non-treated early groups were classified in the same MRI
cluster which is the expected for patient's population with PBD. However, in
MEPs and neuropediatric evaluations clustering, the 67% of Katona group were
assigning into Healthy group showing the impact of Katona therapy over the
patients treated with it. These results highlight the Katona therapy benefits
in early rehabilitation of infants with moderate-to-severe PBD. Conclusions:
Katona therapy and early rehabilitation have an important therapeutic effect in
infants with moderate-to-severe PBD by decreasing the severity of motor
disability in later stages of life.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;High-dimensional generative models have many applications including image
compression, multimedia generation, anomaly detection and data completion.
State-of-the-art estimators for natural images are autoregressive, decomposing
the joint distribution over pixels into a product of conditionals parameterized
by a deep neural network, e.g. a convolutional neural network such as the
PixelCNN. However, PixelCNNs only model a single decomposition of the joint,
and only a single generation order is efficient. For tasks such as image
completion, these models are unable to use much of the observed context. To
generate data in arbitrary orders, we introduce LMConv: a simple modification
to the standard 2D convolution that allows arbitrary masks to be applied to the
weights at each location in the image. Using LMConv, we learn an ensemble of
distribution estimators that share parameters but differ in generation order,
achieving improved performance on whole-image density estimation (2.89 bpd on
unconditional CIFAR10), as well as globally coherent image completions. Our
code is available at https://ajayjain.github.io/lmconv.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regular expression is important for many natural language processing tasks
especially when used to deal with unstructured and semi-structured data. This
work focuses on automatically generating regular expressions and proposes a
novel genetic algorithm to deal with this problem. Different from the methods
which generate regular expressions from character level, we first utilize byte
pair encoder (BPE) to extract some frequent items, which are then used to
construct regular expressions. The fitness function of our genetic algorithm
contains multi objectives and is solved based on evolutionary procedure
including crossover and mutation operation. In the fitness function, we take
the length of generated regular expression, the maximum matching characters and
samples for positive training samples, and the minimum matching characters and
samples for negative training samples into consideration. In addition, to
accelerate the training process, we do exponential decay on the population size
of the genetic algorithm. Our method together with a strong baseline is tested
on 13 kinds of challenging datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, which outperforms the baseline on 10 kinds of data and achieves
nearly 50 percent improvement on average. By doing exponential decay, the
training speed is approximately 100 times faster than the methods without using
exponential decay. In summary, our method possesses both effectiveness and
efficiency, and can be implemented for the industry application.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We are often interested in identifying the feasible subset of a decision
space under multiple constraints to permit effective design exploration. If
determining feasibility required computationally expensive simulations, the
cost of exploration would be prohibitive. Bayesian search is data-efficient for
such problems: starting from a small dataset, the central concept is to use
Bayesian models of constraints with an acquisition function to locate promising
solutions that may improve predictions of feasibility when the dataset is
augmented. At the end of this sequential active learning approach with a
limited number of expensive evaluations, the models can accurately predict the
feasibility of any solution obviating the need for full simulations. In this
paper, we propose a novel acquisition function that combines the probability
that a solution lies at the boundary between feasible and infeasible spaces
(representing exploitation) and the entropy in predictions (representing
exploration). Experiments confirmed the efficacy of the proposed function.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of stroke and to explore the effect of miR-224-5p in hypoxic cortical neurons. Firstly, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model with Sprague–Dawley rats. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed the brain infarction of an MCAO rat. Longa scores of rats were significantly increased in 12th, 24th, and 48th hours after MCAO. Then, we found that miR-224-5p was increased after MCAO in rats by qRT-PCR. In order to investigate the effect of miR-224-5p in hypoxic neurons, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model with cortical neurons. MiR-224-5p was also upregulated in neurons after OGD by qRT-PCR. After transfection of the miR-224-5p inhibitor, the number of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group significantly increased (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in comparison to the anti-NC group. Furthermore, Tuj1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (neuronal marker) staining and TUNEL assay (to detect apoptotic cells) were performed in neurons. The survival of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group was significantly improved (P &amp;lt; 0.01), while the apoptosis of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.01), when compared with that of the anti-NC group. In addition, we predicted that potential target genes of miR-224-5p were nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), and ring finger protein 38 (RNF38) with bioinformatics databases, such as TargetScan, miRDB, miRmap, and miRanda. The result of qRT-PCR confirmed that NR4A1 was significantly decreased after hypoxic injury (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, luciferase reporter’s assay indicated that NR4A1 was the direct target of miR-224-5p. Compared with the anti-miR-224-5p + siNC group, the number of cortical neurons and the length of the neuron axon in the anti-miR-224-5p + si-NR4A1 group were significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and the number of neuronal apoptosis in the anti-miR-224-5p + si-NR4A1 group was increased (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, miR-224-5p played a crucial role in hypoxic neuron injury through NR4A1, which might be an important regulatory mechanism in OGD injury of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alpha-Lipoic Acid Mediates Clearance of Iron Accumulation by Regulating Iron Metabolism in a Parkinson’s Disease Model Induced by 6-OHDA</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The disruption of neuronal iron homeostasis and oxidative stress are related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring enzyme cofactor with antioxidant and iron chelator properties and has many known effects. ALA has neuroprotective effects on PD. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established PD models induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to explore the neuroprotective ability of ALA and its underlying mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that ALA could provide significant protection from 6-OHDA-induced cell damage in vitro by decreasing the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and iron. ALA significantly promoted the survival of the dopaminergic neuron in the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model and remarkably ameliorated motor deficits by dramatically inhibiting the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase expression and superoxide dismutase activity in the substantia nigra. Interestingly, ALA attenuated 6-OHDA-induced iron accumulation both in vivo and in vitro by antagonizing the 6-OHDA-induced upregulation of iron regulatory protein 2 and divalent metal transporter 1. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanism of ALA against neurological injury induced by 6-OHDA may be related to the regulation of iron homeostasis and reduced oxidative stress levels. Therefore, ALA may provide neuroprotective therapy for PD and other diseases related to iron metabolism disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key effector downstream of the Hippo signaling pathway and plays an important role in the development of the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS), especially regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of YAP in CNS diseases are still puzzling. Here, this review will systematically and comprehensively summarize the biological feature, pathological role, and underlying mechanisms of YAP in normal and pathologic CNS, which aims to provide insights into the potential molecular targets and new therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The After-Effect of Accelerated Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation at Different Session Intervals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00576</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00576</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The study aims to investigate the after-effect of three sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on motor cortical excitability. The iTBS was induced over the primary motor cortex (M1) at different time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study has a crossover design. Sixteen participants were assigned to three groups and received different accelerated iTBS (aiTBS) protocols during each visit: (1) three continuous sessions with no interval (iTBS18000); (2) three iTBS sessions with 10-min intervals (iTBS600 × 3&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;10); and (3) three iTBS sessions with 30-min intervals (iTBS600 × 3&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;30). As washout period, each visit is separated by at least 7 days. We measured the motor cortical excitability changes and intracortical inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A dose of 1,800 pulses of aiTBS per day is tolerable. The iTBS1800 led to a reduced cortical excitability; whereas iTBS600 × 3&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;10 and iTBS600 × 3&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;30 enhanced cortical excitability to a differential extent. After a total dose of 1,800 pulses, iTBS600 × 3&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;30 exhibited the longer effect and highest percentage of individuals with enhanced cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that aiTBS protocols at different time intervals result in different motor cortical excitability after-effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Secondary Worsening Following DYT1 Dystonia Deep Brain Stimulation: A Multi-country Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00242</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00242</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To reveal clinical characteristics of suboptimal responses to deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a multi-country DYT1 dystonia cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this multi-country multi-center retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical data of DYT1 patients who experienced suboptimal responses to DBS defined as &amp;lt;30% improvement in dystonia scales at the last follow-up compared with baseline. We used a literature-driven historical cohort of 112 DYT1 patients for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Approximately 8% of our study cohort (11 out of 132) experienced suboptimal responses to DBS. Compared with the historical cohort, the multi-country cohort with suboptimal responses had a significantly younger age at onset (mean, 7.0 vs. 8.4 years; p = 0.025) and younger age at DBS (mean, 12.0 vs. 18.6 years; p = 0.019). Additionally, cranial involvement was more common in the multi-country cohort (before DBS, 64% vs. 45%, p = 0.074; before or after DBS, 91% vs. 47%, p = 0.001). Mean motor improvement at the last follow-up from baseline were 0% and 66% for the multi-country and historical cohorts, respectively. All 11 patients of the multi-country cohort had generalization of dystonia within 2.5 years after disease onset. All patients experienced dystonia improvement of &amp;gt;30% postoperatively; however, secondary worsening of dystonia commenced between 6 months and 3 years following DBS. The improvement at the last follow-up was less than 30% despite optimally-placed leads, a trial of multiple programming settings, and additional DBS surgeries in all patients. The on-/off-stimulation comparison at the long-term follow-up demonstrated beneficial effects of DBS despite missing the threshold of 30% improvement over baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Approximately 8% of patients represent a more aggressive phenotype of DYT1 dystonia characterized by younger age at onset, faster disease progression, and cranial involvement, which seems to be associated with long-term suboptimal responses to DBS (e.g., secondary worsening). This information could be useful for both clinicians and patients in clinical decision making and patient counseling before and following DBS implantations. Patients with this phenotype may have different neuroplasticity, neurogenetics, or possibly distinct neurophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Different Effects of 2 mA and 4 mA Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Muscle Activity and Torque in a Maximal Isokinetic Fatigue Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00240</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00240</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies investigating the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on fatigue and muscle activity have elicited measurable improvements using stimulation intensities ≤2 mA and submaximal effort tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 2 mA and 4 mA anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on performance fatigability and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the leg muscles during a maximal isokinetic task in healthy young adults. A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study design was applied. Twenty-seven active young adults completed four sessions, each spaced by 5–8 days. During session 1, dominance was verified with isokinetic strength testing, and subjects were familiarized with the fatigue task (FT). The FT protocol included 40 continuous maximum isokinetic contractions of the knee extensors and flexors (120°/s, concentric/concentric). During Sessions 2–4, tDCS was applied for 20 min with one of three randomly assigned intensities (sham, 2 mA or 4 mA) and the FT was repeated. The anode and cathode of the tDCS device were placed over C3 and the contralateral supraorbital area, respectively. A wireless EMG system collected muscle activity during the FT. The 2 mA tDCS condition had significantly less torque (65.9 ± 32.7 Nm) during the FT than both the sham (68.4 ± 33.9 Nm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (68.4 ± 33.9 Nm, p = 0.001). Furthermore, the 2 mA condition (33.8 ± 11.7%) had significantly less EMG activity during the FT than both the sham (39.7 ± 10.6%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (40.5 ± 13.4%, p = 0.001). Contrary to previous submaximal isometric fatigue investigations, the 2 mA tDCS condition significantly reduced torque production and EMG activity of the leg extensors during a maximal isokinetic FT compared with the sham and 4 mA conditions. Also, torque production and EMG activity in the 4 mA condition were not significantly different from sham. Thus, the effects of tDCS, and the underlying mechanisms, might not be the same for different tasks and warrants more investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Positive and Detached Reappraisal of Threatening Music in Younger and Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00216</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00216</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Past empirical studies have suggested that older adults preferentially use gaze-based mood regulation to lessen their negative experiences while watching an emotional scene. This preference for a low cognitively demanding regulatory strategy leaves open the question of whether the effortful processing of a more cognitively demanding reappraisal task is really spared from the general age-related decline. Because it does not allow perceptual attention to be redirected away from the emotional source, music provides an ideal way to address this question. The goal of our study was to examine the affective, behavioral, physiological, and cognitive outcomes of positive and detached reappraisal in response to negative musical emotion in younger and older adults. Participants first simply listened to a series of threatening musical excerpts and were then instructed to either positively reappraise or to detach themselves from the emotion elicited by music. Findings showed that, when instructed to simply listen to threatening music, older adults reported a more positive feeling associated with a smaller SCL in comparison with their younger counterparts. When implementing positive and detached reappraisal, participants showed more positive and more aroused emotional experiences, whatever the age group. We also found that the instruction to intentionally reappraise negative emotions results in a lesser cognitive cost for older adults in comparison with younger adults. Taken together, these data suggest that, compared to younger adults, older adults engage in spontaneous downregulation of negative affect and successfully implement downregulation instructions. This extends previous findings and brings compelling evidence that, even when auditory attention cannot be redirected away from the emotional source, older adults are still more effective at regulating emotions. Taking into account the age-associated decline in executive functioning, our results suggest that the working memory task could have distracted older adults from the reminiscences of the threat-evoking music, thus resulting in an emotional downregulation. Hence, even if they were instructed to implement reappraisal strategies, older adults might prefer distraction over engagement in reappraisal. This is congruent with the idea that, although getting older, people are more likely to be distracted from a negative source of emotion to maintain their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural synchronization patterns are involved in several complex cognitive functions and constitute a growing trend in neuroscience research. While synchrony patterns in working memory have been extensively discussed, a complete understanding of their role in cognitive control and inhibition is still elusive. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on synchronization patterns underlying behavioral inhibition, extrapolating common grounds, and dissociating features with other inhibitory functions. Moreover, we suggest a schematic conceptual framework and highlight existing gaps in the literature, current methodological challenges, and compelling research questions for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: In Search of a Dose: The Functional and Molecular Effects of Exercise on Post-stroke Rehabilitation in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00186</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00186</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although physical exercise has been demonstrated to augment recovery of the post-stroke brain, the question of what level of exercise intensity optimizes neurological outcomes of post-stroke rehabilitation remains unsettled. In this study, we aim to clarify the mechanisms underlying the intensity-dependent effect of exercise on neurologic function, and thereby to help direct the clinical application of exercise-based neurorehabilitation. To do this, we used a well-established rat model of ischemic stroke consisting of cerebral ischemia induction through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Ischemic rats were subsequently assigned either to a control group entailing post-stroke rest or to one of two exercise groups distinguished by the intensity of their accompanying treadmill regimens. After 24 h of reperfusion, exercise was initiated. Infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neurological defects were quantified in all groups at 3 days, and motor and cognitive functions were tracked up to day-28. Additionally, Western blotting was used to assess the influence of our interventions on several proteins related to synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity (growth-associated protein 43, a microtubule-associated protein, postsynaptic density-95, synapsin I, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, tyrosine kinase B, and cAMP response element-binding protein). Our results were in equal parts encouraging and surprising. Both mild and intense exercise significantly decreased infarct volume, cell death, and neurological deficits. Motor and cognitive function, as determined using an array of tests such as beam balance, forelimb placing, and the Morris water maze, were also significantly improved by both exercise protocols. Interestingly, while an obvious enhancement of neuroplasticity proteins was shown in both exercise groups, mild exercise rats demonstrated a stronger effect on the expressions of Tau (p &amp;lt; 0.01), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and tyrosine kinase B (p &amp;lt; 0.05). These findings contribute to the growing body of literature regarding the positive effects of both mild and intense long-term treadmill exercise on brain injury, functional outcome, and neuroplasticity. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of HIF-1α on the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Small-Medium Extracellular Vesicles and Their miRNA Cargo in Retinal Health and Degeneration: Mediators of Homeostasis, and Vehicles for Targeted Gene Therapy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor cell death and inflammation are known to occur progressively in retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological processes are largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are essential mediators of cell-to-cell communication with emerging roles in the modulation of immune responses. EVs, including exosomes, encapsulate and transfer microRNA (miRNA) to recipient cells and in this way can modulate the environment of recipient cells. Dysregulation of EVs however is correlated to a loss of cellular homeostasis and increased inflammation. In this work we investigated the role of isolated retinal small-medium sized EV (s-mEV) which includes exosomes in both the healthy and degenerating retina. Isolated s-mEV from normal retinas were characterized using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting, and quantified across 5 days of photo-oxidative damage-induced degeneration using nanotracking analysis. Small RNAseq was used to characterize the miRNA cargo of retinal s-mEV isolated from healthy and damaged retinas. Finally, the effect of exosome inhibition on cell-to-cell miRNA transfer and immune modulation was conducted using systemic daily administration of exosome inhibitor GW4869 and in situ hybridization of s-mEV-abundant miRNA, miR-124-3p. Electroretinography and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess functional and morphological changes to the retina as a result of GW4869-induced exosome depletion. Results demonstrated an inverse correlation between s-mEV concentration and photoreceptor survivability, with a decrease in s-mEV numbers following degeneration. Small RNAseq revealed that s-mEVs contained uniquely enriched miRNAs in comparison to in whole retinal tissue, however, there was no differential change in the s-mEV miRNAnome following photo-oxidative damage. Exosome inhibition via the use of GW4869 was also found to exacerbate retinal degeneration, with reduced retinal function and increased levels of inflammation and cell death demonstrated following photo-oxidative damage in exosome-inhibited mice. Further, GW4869-treated mice displayed impaired translocation of photoreceptor-derived miR-124-3p to the inner retina during damage. Taken together, we propose that retinal s-mEV and their miRNA cargo play an essential role in maintaining retinal homeostasis through immune-modulation, and have the potential to be used in targeted gene therapy for retinal degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein are central to Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for these events are not fully understood. Post-translational modifications of α-synuclein regulate several of its properties, including degradation, interaction with proteins and membranes, aggregation and toxicity. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involved in various nuclear and extranuclear processes, such as subcellular protein targeting, mitochondrial fission and synaptic plasticity. Protein SUMOylation increases in response to several stressful situations, from viral infections to trauma. In this framework, an increasing amount of evidence has implicated SUMOylation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. This review will discuss recent findings in the role of SUMOylation as a regulator of α-synuclein accumulation, aggregation and toxicity, and its possible implication in neurodegeneration that underlies PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Visual systems estimate the three-dimensional (3D) structure of scenes from information in two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. Visual systems use multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including statistical knowledge of the probable spatial arrangements of natural scenes. Here, we examine how 3D surface tilts are spatially related in real-world scenes, and show that humans pool information across space when estimating surface tilt in accordance with these spatial relationships. We develop a hierarchical model of surface tilt estimation that is grounded in the statistics of tilt in natural scenes and images. The model computes a global tilt estimate by pooling local tilt estimates within an adaptive spatial neighborhood. The spatial neighborhood in which local estimates are pooled changes according to the value of the local estimate at a target location. The hierarchical model provides more accurate estimates of groundtruth tilt in natural scenes and provides a better account of human performance than the local model. Taken together, the results imply that the human visual system pools information about surface tilt across space in accordance with natural scene statistics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvVMYJ-9G20&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Shared neuronal variability has been shown to modulate cognitive processing. However, the relationship between shared variability and behavioral performance is heterogeneous and complex in frontal areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Mounting evidence shows that single-units in OFC encode a detailed cognitive map of task-space events, but the existence of a robust neuronal ensemble coding for the predictability of choice outcome is less established. Here, we hypothesize that the coding of foreseeable outcomes is potentially unclear from the analysis of units activity and their pairwise correlations. However, this code might be established more conclusively when higher-order neuronal interactions are mapped to the choice outcome. As a case study, we investigated the trial-to-trial shared variability of neuronal ensemble activity during a two-choice interval-discrimination task in rodent OFC, specifically designed such that a lose-switch strategy is optimal by repeating the rewarded stimulus in the upcoming trial. Results show that correlations among triplets are higher during correct choices with respect to incorrect ones, and that this is sustained during the entire trial. This effect is not observed for pairwise nor for higher than third-order correlations. This scenario is compatible with constellations of up to three interacting units assembled during trials in which the task is performed correctly. More interestingly, a state-space spanned by such constellations shows that only correct outcome states that can be successfully predicted are robust over 100 trials of the task, and thus they can be accurately decoded. However, both incorrect and unpredictable outcome representations were unstable and thus non-decodeable, due to spurious negative correlations. Our results suggest that predictability of successful outcomes, and hence the optimal behavioral strategy, can be mapped out in OFC ensemble states reliable over trials of the task, and revealed by sufficiency complex neuronal interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PGyrJ6PKf94&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During embryogenesis, morphogens form a concentration gradient in responsive tissue, which is then translated into a spatial cellular pattern. The mechanisms by which morphogens spread through a tissue to establish such a morphogenetic field remain elusive. Here, we investigate by mutually complementary simulations and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments how Wnt morphogen transport by cytonemes differs from typically assumed diffusion-based transport for patterning of highly dynamic tissue such as the neural plate in zebrafish. Stochasticity strongly influences fate acquisition at the single cell level and results in fluctuating boundaries between pattern regions. Stable patterning can be achieved by sorting through concentration dependent cell migration and apoptosis, independent of the morphogen transport mechanism. We show that Wnt transport by cytonemes achieves distinct Wnt thresholds for the brain primordia earlier compared with diffusion-based transport. We conclude that a cytoneme-mediated morphogen transport together with directed cell sorting is a potentially favored mechanism to establish morphogen gradients in rapidly expanding developmental systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lDRf_GSbN80&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) make possible to interact with the external
environment by decoding the mental intention of individuals. BCIs can therefore
be used to address basic neuroscience questions but also to unlock a variety of
applications from exoskeleton control to neurofeedback (NFB) rehabilitation. In
general, BCI usability critically depends on the ability to comprehensively
characterize brain functioning and correctly identify the user s mental state.
To this end, much of the efforts have focused on improving the classification
algorithms taking into account localized brain activities as input features.
Despite considerable improvement BCI performance is still unstable and, as a
matter of fact, current features represent oversimplified descriptors of brain
functioning. In the last decade, growing evidence has shown that the brain
works as a networked system composed of multiple specialized and spatially
distributed areas that dynamically integrate information. While more complex,
looking at how remote brain regions functionally interact represents a grounded
alternative to better describe brain functioning. Thanks to recent advances in
network science, i.e. a modern field that draws on graph theory, statistical
mechanics, data mining and inferential modelling, scientists have now powerful
means to characterize complex brain networks derived from neuroimaging data.
Notably, summary features can be extracted from these networks to
quantitatively measure specific organizational properties across a variety of
topological scales. In this topical review, we aim to provide the
state-of-the-art supporting the development of a network theoretic approach as
a promising tool for understanding BCIs and improve usability.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Inference with Artificial Neural Networks on the Analog BrainScaleS-2 Hardware. (arXiv:2006.13177v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromorphic BrainScaleS-2 ASIC comprises mixed-signal neurons and
synapse circuits as well as two versatile digital microprocessors. Primarily
designed to emulate spiking neural networks, the system can also operate in a
vector-matrix multiplication and accumulation mode for artificial neural
networks. Analog multiplication is then carried out in the synapse circuits,
while the results are accumulated on the neurons' membrane capacitors. Designed
as an analog, in-memory computing device, it promises high energy efficiency.
Fixed-pattern noise and trial-to-trial variations, however, require the
implemented networks to cope with a certain level of perturbations. Further
limitations are imposed by the digital resolution of the input values (5-bit),
matrix weights (6-bit) and resulting neuron activations (8-bit). In this paper,
we discuss BrainScaleS-2 as an analog inference accelerator and present
calibration as well as optimization strategies, highlighting the advantages of
training with hardware in the loop. Among other benchmarks, we classify the
MNIST handwritten digits dataset using a two-dimensional convolution and two
dense layers. We reach 98.0 % test accuracy, closely matching the performance
of the same network evaluated in software.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article reviews how organisms learn and recognize the world through the
dynamics of neural networks from the perspective of Bayesian inference, and
introduces a view on how such dynamics is described by the laws for the entropy
of neural activity, a paradigm that we call thermodynamics of the Bayesian
brain. The Bayesian brain hypothesis sees the stimulus-evoked activity of
neurons as an act of constructing the Bayesian posterior distribution based on
the generative model of the external world that an organism possesses. A closer
look at the stimulus-evoked activity at early sensory cortices reveals that
feedforward connections initially mediate the stimulus-response, which is later
modulated by input from recurrent connections. Importantly, not the initial
response, but the delayed modulation expresses animals' cognitive states such
as awareness and attention regarding the stimulus. Using a simple generative
model made of a spiking neural population, we reproduce the stimulus-evoked
dynamics with the delayed feedback modulation as the process of the Bayesian
inference that integrates the stimulus evidence and a prior knowledge with
time-delay. We then introduce a thermodynamic view on this process based on the
laws for the entropy of neural activity. This view elucidates that the process
of the Bayesian inference works as the recently-proposed information-theoretic
engine (neural engine, an analogue of a heat engine in thermodynamics), which
allows us to quantify the perceptual capacity expressed in the delayed
modulation in terms of entropy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present software facilitating the usage of the BrainScaleS-2 analog
neuromorphic hardware system as an inference accelerator for artificial neural
networks. The accelerator hardware is transparently integrated into the PyTorch
machine learning framework using its extension interface. In particular, we
provide accelerator support for vector-matrix multiplications and convolutions;
corresponding software-based autograd functionality is provided for
hardware-in-the-loop training. Automatic partitioning of neural networks onto
one or multiple accelerator chips is supported. We analyze implementation
runtime overhead during training as well as inference, provide measurements for
existing setups and evaluate the results in terms of the accelerator hardware
design limitations. As an application of the introduced framework, we present a
model that classifies activities of daily living with smartphone sensor data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper provides a formalization of the energy disaggregation problem for
particle swarm optimization and shows the successful application of particle
swarm optimization for disaggregation in a multi-tenant commercial building.
The developed mathmatical description of the disaggregation problem using a
state changes matrix belongs to the group of non-event based methods for energy
disaggregation. This work includes the development of an objective function in
the power domain and the description of position and velocity of each particle
in a high dimensional state space. For the particle swarm optimization, four
adaptions have been applied to improve the results of disaggregation, increase
the robustness of the optimizer regarding local optima and reduce the
computational time. The adaptions are varying movement constants, shaking of
particles, framing and an early stopping criterion. In this work we use two
unlabelled power datasets with a granularity of 1 s. Therefore, the results are
validated in the power domain in which good results regarding multiple error
measures like root mean squared error or the percentage energy error can be
shown.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being the workhorse of deep learning, the backpropagation algorithm
is no panacea. It enforces sequential layer updates, thus preventing efficient
parallelization of the training process. Furthermore, its biological
plausibility is being challenged. Alternative schemes have been devised; yet,
under the constraint of synaptic asymmetry, none have scaled to modern deep
learning tasks and architectures. Here, we challenge this perspective, and
study the applicability of Direct Feedback Alignment to neural view synthesis,
recommender systems, geometric learning, and natural language processing. In
contrast with previous studies limited to computer vision tasks, our findings
show that it successfully trains a large range of state-of-the-art deep
learning architectures, with performance close to fine-tuned backpropagation.
At variance with common beliefs, our work supports that challenging tasks can
be tackled in the absence of weight transport.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain pathologies can vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from few pixels
(i.e. MS lesions) to large, space-occupying tumors. Recently proposed
Autoencoder-based methods for unsupervised anomaly segmentation in brain MRI
have shown promising performance, but face difficulties in modeling
distributions with high fidelity, which is crucial for accurate delineation of
particularly small lesions. Here, similar to these previous works, we model the
distribution of healthy brain MRI to localize pathologies from erroneous
reconstructions. However, to achieve improved reconstruction fidelity at higher
resolutions, we learn to compress and reconstruct different frequency bands of
healthy brain MRI using the laplacian pyramid. In a range of experiments
comparing our method to different State-of-the-Art approaches on three
different brain MR datasets with MS lesions and tumors, we show improved
anomaly segmentation performance and the general capability to obtain much more
crisp reconstructions of input data at native resolution. The modeling of the
laplacian pyramid further enables the delineation and aggregation of lesions at
multiple scales, which allows to effectively cope with different pathologies
and lesion sizes using a single model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, we focus on the improvement of the direct feedback
alignment (DFA) algorithm and extend the usage of the DFA to convolutional and
recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs). Even though the DFA algorithm is
biologically plausible and has a potential of high-speed training, it has not
been considered as the substitute for back-propagation (BP) due to the low
accuracy in the CNN and RNN training. In this work, we propose a new DFA
algorithm for BP-level accurate CNN and RNN training. Firstly, we divide the
network into several modules and apply the DFA algorithm within the module.
Second, the DFA with the sparse backward weight is applied. It comes with a
form of dilated convolution in the CNN case, and in a form of sparse matrix
multiplication in the RNN case. Additionally, the error propagation method of
CNN becomes simpler through the group convolution. Finally, hybrid DFA
increases the accuracy of the CNN and RNN training to the BP-level while taking
advantage of the parallelism and hardware efficiency of the DFA algorithm.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deciding the amount of neurons during the design of a deep neural network to
maximize performance is not intuitive. In this work, we attempt to search for
the neuron (filter) configuration of a fixed network architecture that
maximizes accuracy. Using iterative pruning methods as a proxy, we parameterize
the change of the neuron (filter) number of each layer with respect to the
change in parameters, allowing us to efficiently scale an architecture across
arbitrary sizes. We also introduce architecture descent which iteratively
refines the parameterized function used for model scaling. The combination of
both proposed methods is coined as NeuralScale. To prove the efficiency of
NeuralScale in terms of parameters, we show empirical simulations on VGG11,
MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 using CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet as benchmark
datasets. Our results show an increase in accuracy of 3.04%, 8.56% and 3.41%
for VGG11, MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet
respectively under a parameter-constrained setting (output neurons (filters) of
default configuration with scaling factor of 0.25).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many important problems can be regarded as maximizing submodular functions
under some constraints. A simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called
GSEMO has been shown to achieve good approximation for submodular functions
efficiently. While there have been many studies on the subject, most of
existing run-time analyses for GSEMO assume a single cardinality constraint. In
this work, we extend the theoretical results to partition matroid constraints
which generalize cardinality constraints, and show that GSEMO can generally
guarantee good approximation performance within polynomial expected run time.
Furthermore, we conducted experimental comparison against a baseline GREEDY
algorithm in maximizing undirected graph cuts on random graphs, under various
partition matroid constraints. The results show GSEMO tends to outperform
GREEDY in quadratic run time.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a new family of neural networks to predict the behaviors of
physical systems by learning their underpinning constraints. A neural
projection operator liesat the heart of our approach, composed of a lightweight
network with an embedded recursive architecture that interactively enforces
learned underpinning constraints and predicts the various governed behaviors of
different physical systems. Our neural projection operator is motivated by the
position-based dynamics model that has been used widely in game and visual
effects industries to unify the various fast physics simulators. Our method can
automatically and effectively uncover a broad range of constraints from
observation point data, such as length, angle, bending, collision, boundary
effects, and their arbitrary combinations, without any connectivity priors. We
provide a multi-group point representation in conjunction with a configurable
network connection mechanism to incorporate prior inputs for processing complex
physical systems. We demonstrated the efficacy of our approach by learning a
set of challenging physical systems all in a unified and simple fashion
including: rigid bodies with complex geometries, ropes with varying length and
bending, articulated soft and rigid bodies, and multi-object collisions with
complex boundaries.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have gained great success in many
artificial intelligence tasks. However, finding a good set of hyperparameters
for a CNN remains a challenging task. It usually takes an expert with deep
knowledge, and trials and errors. Genetic algorithms have been used in
hyperparameter optimizations. However, traditional genetic algorithms with
fixed-length chromosomes may not be a good fit for optimizing deep learning
hyperparameters, because deep learning models have variable number of
hyperparameters depending on the model depth. As the depth increases, the
number of hyperparameters grows exponentially, and searching becomes
exponentially harder. It is important to have an efficient algorithm that can
find a good model in reasonable time. In this article, we propose to use a
variable length genetic algorithm (GA) to systematically and automatically tune
the hyperparameters of a CNN to improve its performance. Experimental results
show that our algorithm can find good CNN hyperparameters efficiently. It is
clear from our experiments that if more time is spent on optimizing the
hyperparameters, better results could be achieved. Theoretically, if we had
unlimited time and CPU power, we could find the optimized hyperparameters and
achieve the best results in the future.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotion perception is essential to affective and cognitive development which
involves distributed brain circuits. The ability of emotion identification
begins in infancy and continues to develop throughout childhood and
adolescence. Understanding the development of brain's emotion circuitry may
help us explain the emotional changes observed during adolescence. Our previous
study delineated the trajectory of brain functional connectivity (FC) from late
childhood to early adulthood during emotion identification tasks. In this work,
we endeavour to deepen our understanding from association to causation. We
proposed a Bayesian incorporated linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (BiLiNGAM),
which incorporated our previous association model into the prior estimation
pipeline. In particular, it can jointly estimate multiple directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs) for multiple age groups at different developmental stages.
Simulation results indicated more stable and accurate performance over various
settings, especially when the sample size was small (high-dimensional cases).
We then applied to the analysis of real data from the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). This included 855 individuals aged 8-22 years
who were divided into five different adolescent stages. Our network analysis
revealed the development of emotion-related intra- and inter- modular
connectivity and pinpointed several emotion-related hubs. We further
categorized the hubs into two types: in-hubs and out-hubs, as the center of
receiving and distributing information. Several unique developmental hub
structures and group-specific patterns were also discovered. Our findings help
provide a causal understanding of emotion development in the human brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I present a computational-level model of semantic interference effects in
word production. Word production is cast as a rate-distortion problem where an
agent selects words to minimize a measure of cost while also minimizing the
resources used to compute the output word based on perceptual input and
behavioral goals. I show that similarity-based interference among words arises
naturally in this setup, and I present a series of simulations showing that the
model captures some of the key empirical patterns observed in Stroop and
Picture-Word Interference paradigms. I argue that the rate-distortion account
of interference provides a high-level formalization of computational principles
that are instantiated more mechanistically in existing models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning (DL) models are becoming larger, because the increase in model
size might offer significant accuracy gain. To enable the training of large
deep networks, data parallelism and model parallelism are two well-known
approaches for parallel training. However, data parallelism does not help
reduce memory footprint per device. In this work, we introduce Large deep 3D
ConvNets with Automated Model Parallelism (LAMP) and investigate the impact of
both input's and deep 3D ConvNets' size on segmentation accuracy. Through
automated model parallelism, it is feasible to train large deep 3D ConvNets
with a large input patch, even the whole image. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, facilitated by the automated model parallelism, the
segmentation accuracy can be improved through increasing model size and input
context size, and large input yields significant inference speedup compared
with sliding window of small patches in the inference. Code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/wentaozhu/lamp-automated-model-parallelism}.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Always-on artificial intelligent (AI) functions such as keyword spotting
(KWS) and visual wake-up tend to dominate total power consumption in ultra-low
power devices. A key observation is that the signals to an always-on function
are sparse in time, which a spiking neural network (SNN) classifier can
leverage for power savings, because the switching activity and power
consumption of SNNs tend to scale with spike rate. Toward this goal, we present
a novel SNN classifier architecture for always-on functions, demonstrating
sub-300nW power consumption at the competitive inference accuracy for a KWS and
other always-on classification workloads.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a common 4R-tauopathy, causing or contributing to cognitive impairment in the elderly. AGD is characterized neuropathologically by pre-tangles in neurons, dendritic swellings called grains, threads, thorn-shaped astrocytes, and coiled bodies in oligodendrocytes in the limbic system. AGD has a characteristic pattern progressively involving the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, presubiculum, subiculum, hypothalamic nuclei, temporal cortex, and neocortex and brainstem, thus suggesting that argyrophilic grain pathology is a natural model of tau propagation. One series of WT mice was unilaterally inoculated in the hippocampus with sarkosyl-insoluble and sarkosyl-soluble fractions from “pure” AGD at the age of 3 or 7/12 months and killed 3 or 7 months later. Abnormal hyper-phosphorylated tau deposits were found in ipsilateral hippocampal neurons, grains (dots) in the hippocampus, and threads, dots and coiled bodies in the fimbria, as well as the ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum. The extension of lesions was wider in animals surviving 7 months compared with those surviving 3 months. Astrocytic inclusions were not observed at any time. Tau deposits were mainly composed of 4Rtau, but also 3Rtau. For comparative purposes, another series of WT mice was inoculated with sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a pure neuronal neurofibrillary tangle 3Rtau + 4Rtau tauopathy involving the deep temporal cortex and limbic system. Abnormal hyper-phosphorylated tau deposits were found in neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus, coiled bodies and threads in the fimbria, and the ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum, which extended with time along the anterior-posterior axis and distant regions such as hypothalamic nuclei and nuclei of the septum when comparing mice surviving 7 months with mice surviving 3 months. Astrocytic inclusions were not observed. Tau deposits were mainly composed of 4Rtau and 3Rtau. These results show the capacity for seeding and spreading of AGD tau and PART tau in the brain of WT mouse, and suggest that characteristics of host tau, in addition to those of inoculated tau, are key to identifying commonalities and differences between human tauopathies and corresponding murine models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Insights to underlying neural mechanisms in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have emerged from neuroimaging research; however, the neural mechanisms that distinguish ADHD subtypes remain inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We reviewed 19 studies integrating magnetic resonance imaging [MRI; structural (sMRI), diffusion, functional MRI (fMRI)] findings into a framework exploring pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the combined (ADHD-C) and predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I) ADHD subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Despite equivocal structural MRI results, findings from fMRI and DTI imaging modalities consistently implicate disrupted connectivity in regions and tracts involving frontal striatal thalamic in ADHD-C and frontoparietal neural networks in ADHD-I. Alterations of the default mode, cerebellum, and motor networks in ADHD-C and cingulo-frontoparietal attention and visual networks in ADHD-I highlight network organization differences between subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Growing evidence from neuroimaging studies highlight neurobiological differences between ADHD clinical subtypes, particularly from a network perspective. Understanding brain network organization and connectivity may help us to better conceptualize the ADHD types and their symptom variability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Pulse Pressure: An Emerging Therapeutic Target for Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00669</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00669</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elevated pulse pressure can cause blood-brain barrier dysfunction and subsequent adverse neurological changes that may drive or contribute to the development of dementia with age. In short, elevated pulse pressure dysregulates cerebral endothelial cells and increases cellular production of oxidative and inflammatory molecules. The resulting cerebral microvascular damage, along with excessive pulsatile mechanical force, can induce breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which in turn triggers brain cell impairment and death. We speculate that elevated pulse pressure may also reduce the efficacy of other therapeutic strategies for dementia. For instance, BACE1 inhibitors and anti-amyloid-β biologics reduce amyloid-β deposits in the brain that are thought to be a cause of Alzheimer’s disease, the most prevalent form of dementia. However, upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory molecules and increased amyloid-β secretion by cerebral endothelial cells exposed to elevated pulse pressure may hinder cognitive improvements with these drugs. Additionally, stem or progenitor cell therapy has the potential to repair blood-brain barrier damage, but chronic oxidative and inflammatory stress due to elevated pulse pressure can inhibit stem and progenitor cell regeneration. Finally, we discuss current efforts to repurpose blood pressure medications to prevent or treat dementia. We propose that new drugs or devices should be developed to safely reduce elevated pulse pressure specifically to the brain. Such novel technologies may alleviate an entire downstream pathway of cellular dysfunction, oxidation, inflammation, and amyloidogenesis, thereby preventing pulse-pressure-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, these technologies may also enhance efficacy of other dementia therapeutics when used in combination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Nanogrooves for 2D and 3D Microenvironments of SH-SY5Y Cultures in Brain-on-Chip Technology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00666</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00666</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-on-chip (BOC) technology such as nanogrooves and microtunnel structures can advance in vitro neuronal models by providing a platform with better means to maintain, manipulate and analyze neuronal cell cultures. Specifically, nanogrooves have been shown to influence neuronal differentiation, notably the neurite length and neurite direction. Here, we have drawn new results from our experiments using both 2D and 3D neuronal cell culture implementing both flat and nanogrooved substrates. These are used to show a comparison between the number of cells and neurite length as a first indicator for valuable insights into baseline values and expectations that can be generated from these experiments toward design optimization and predictive value of the technology in our BOC toolbox. Also, as a new step toward neuronal cell models with multiple compartmentalized neuronal cell type regions, we fabricated microtunnel devices bonded to both flat and nanogrooved substrates to assess their compatibility with neuronal cell culture. Our results show that with the current experimental protocols using SH-SY5Y cells, we can expect 200 – 400 cells with a total neurite length of approximately 4,000–5,000 μm per 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within our BOC devices, with a lower total neurite length for 3D neuronal cell cultures on flat substrates only. There is a statistically significant difference in total neurite length between 2D cell culture on nanogrooved substrates versus 3D cell culture on flat substrates. As extension of our current BOC toolbox for which these indicative parameters would be used, the microtunnel devices show that culture of SH-SY5Y was feasible, though a limited number of neurites extended into microtunnels away from the cell bodies, regardless of using nanogrooved or flat substrates. This shows that the novel combination of microtunnel devices with nanogrooves can be implemented toward neuronal cell cultures, with future improvements to be performed to ensure neurites extend beyond the confines of the wells between the microtunnels. Overall, these results will aid toward creating more robust BOC platforms with improved predictive value. In turn, this can be used to better understand the brain and brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Improving Real-Time Brain State Classification of Motor Imagery Tasks During Neurofeedback Training</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00623</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00623</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the effect of the dynamic changes in brain activation during neurofeedback training in the classification of the different brain states associated with the target tasks. We hypothesized that ongoing activation patterns could change during neurofeedback session due to learning effects and, in the process, could affect the performance of brain state classifiers trained using data obtained prior to the session. Using a motor imagery paradigm, we then examined the application of an incremental training approach where classifiers were continuously updated in order to account for these activation changes. Our results confirmed our hypothesis that neurofeedback training could be associated with dynamic changes in brain activation characterized by an initially more widespread brain activation followed by a more focused and localized activation pattern. By continuously updating the trained classifiers after each feedback run, significant improvement in accurately classifying the different brain states associated with the target motor imagery tasks was achieved. These findings suggest the importance of taking into account brain activation changes during neurofeedback in order to provide more reliable and accurate feedback information to the participants, which is critical for an effective neurofeedback application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neuroimaging and Neuropsychological Outcomes Following Clinician-Delivered Cognitive Training for Six Patients With Mild Brain Injury: A Multiple Case Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00229</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00229</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all mild brain injury sufferers experience long-term cognitive impairment, so an important goal in rehabilitation is to address their multiple cognitive deficits to help them return to prior levels of functioning. Cognitive training, or the use of repeated mental exercises to enhance cognition, is one remediation method for brain injury. The primary purpose of this hypothesis-generating pilot study was to explore the statistical and clinical significance of cognitive changes and transfer of training to real-life functioning following 60 h of Brain Booster, a clinician-delivered cognitive training program, for six patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) or non-traumatic acquired brain injury (ABI). The secondary purpose was to explore changes in functional connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive test gains following the training. We used a multiple case study design to document significant changes in cognitive test scores, overall IQ score, and symptom ratings; and we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore trends in functional network connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive change. All cognitive test scores showed improvement with statistically significant changes on five of the seven measures (long-term memory, processing speed, reasoning, auditory processing, and overall IQ score). The mean change in IQ score was 20 points, from a mean of 108 to a mean of 128. Five themes emerged from the qualitative data analysis including improvements in cognition, mood, social identity, performance, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). With MRI, we documented significant region-to-region changes in connectivity following cognitive training including those involving the cerebellum and cerebellar networks. We also found significant correlations between changes in IQ score and change in white matter integrity of bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the left uncinate fasciculus. This study adds to the growing body of literature examining the effects of cognitive training for mild TBI and ABI, and to the collection of research on the benefits of cognitive training in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02918994.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tension Experience Induced By Nested Structures In Music</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00210</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00210</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tension experience is the basis for music emotion. In music, discrete elements are always organized into complex nested structures to convey emotion. However, the processing of music tension in the nested structure remains unknown. The present study investigated the tension experience induced by the nested structure and the underlying neural mechanisms, using a continuous tension rating task and electroencephalography (EEG) at the same time. Thirty musicians listened to music chorale sequences with non-nested, singly nested and doubly nested structures and were required to rate their real-time tension experience. Behavioral data indicated that the tension experience induced by the nested structure had more fluctuations than the non-nested structure, and the difference was mainly exhibited in the process of tension induction rather than tension resolution. However, the EEG data showed that larger late positive components (LPCs) were elicited by the ending chords in the nested structure compared with the non-nested structure, reflecting the difference in cognitive integration for long-distance structural dependence. The discrepancy between resolution experience and neural responses revealed the non-parallel relations between emotion and cognition. Furthermore, the LPC elicited by the doubly nested structure showed a smaller scalp distribution than the singly nested structure, indicating the more difficult processing of the doubly nested structure. These findings revealed the dynamic tension experience induced by the nested structure and the influence of nested type, shedding new light on the relationship between structure and tension in music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dissociable Effects of Reward on P300 and EEG Spectra Under Conditions of High vs. Low Vigilance During a Selective Visual Attention Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00207</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The influence of motivation on selective visual attention in states of high vs. low vigilance is poorly understood. To explore the possible differences in the influence of motivation on behavioral performance and neural activity in high and low vigilance levels, we conducted a prolonged 2 h 20 min flanker task and provided monetary rewards during the 20- to 40- and 100- to 120-min intervals of task performance. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological measures were modulated by prolonged task engagement. Moreover, the effect of reward was different in high vs. low vigilance states. The monetary reward increased accuracy and decreased the reaction time (RT) and number of omitted responses in the low but not in the high vigilance state. The fatigue-related decrease in P300 amplitude recovered to its level in the high vigilance state by manipulating motivation, whereas the fatigue-related increase in P300 latency was not modulated by reward. Additionally, the fatigue-related increase in event-related spectral power at 1–4 Hz was sensitive to vigilance decrement and reward. However, the spectral power at 4–8 Hz was only affected by the decrease in vigilance. These electrophysiological measures were not influenced by motivation in the state of high vigilance. Our results suggest that neural processing capacity, but not the timing of processing, is sensitive to motivation. These findings also imply that the fatigue-related impairments in behavioral performance and neural activity underlying selective visual attention only partly recover after manipulating motivation. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the dissociable neural mechanisms underlying the fatigue-related decrease vs. reward-related increase in attentional resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Interpersonal Neural Synchronization During Cooperative Behavior of Basketball Players: A fNIRS-Based Hyperscanning Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00169</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00169</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence has consistently shown that team-based sports (such as basketball) are beneficial to interpersonal cooperation. However, its neural correlate remains to be discovered, especially in the perspective of two-person neuroscience. In this study, 12 dyads of basketball players and 12 dyads of college students who had no experience of team-based sports training were asked to perform joint-drawing task and control task. During task performance, neural activities were recorded in frontal area by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning approach. The results demonstrated that dyads of basketball players were faster to finish joint-drawing task and showed higher subjective cooperativeness than dyads of college students. Meanwhile, significant interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) was observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal area only when pairs of basketball players performed joint-drawing task, but not control task. Therefore, we provide the first piece of inter-brain evidence for enhanced cooperative behavior in the individuals with team-based sports training, which could make us deeply understand exact neural correlate for experience-dependent changes of cognitions in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Serotonergic Axons as Fractional Brownian Motion Paths: Insights Into the Self-Organization of Regional Densities</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;All vertebrate brains contain a dense matrix of thin fibers that release serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), a neurotransmitter that modulates a wide range of neural, glial, and vascular processes. Perturbations in the density of this matrix have been associated with a number of mental disorders, including autism and depression, but its self-organization and plasticity remain poorly understood. We introduce a model based on reflected Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), a rigorously defined stochastic process, and show that it recapitulates some key features of regional serotonergic fiber densities. Specifically, we use supercomputing simulations to model fibers as FBM-paths in two-dimensional brain-like domains and demonstrate that the resultant steady state distributions approximate the fiber distributions in physical brain sections immunostained for the serotonin transporter (a marker for serotonergic axons in the adult brain). We suggest that this framework can support predictive descriptions and manipulations of the serotonergic matrix and that it can be further extended to incorporate the detailed physical properties of the fibers and their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Metformin Ameliorates Synaptic Defects in a Mouse Model of AD by Inhibiting Cdk5 Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by the neuron-specific activators p35/p39 and plays important roles in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive behavior. However, the proteolytic cleavage of p35 to p25 leads to prolonged and aberrant Cdk5 activation and results in synaptic depression, highly mimicking the early pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Therefore, Cdk5 inhibition is a potential promising strategy for AD drug development. Here in the present study, we showed that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 diabetes, suppressed Cdk5 hyper-activation and Cdk5-dependent tau hyper-phosphorylation in the APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus. We also identified the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism that metformin prevented Cdk5 hyper-activation by inhibiting the calpain-dependent cleavage of p35 into p25. Moreover, chronic metformin treatment rescued the core phenotypes in APP/PS1 mice as evidenced by restored spine density, surface GluA1 trafficking, Long-term potentiation (LTP) expression, and spatial memory. Altogether our study discovered an unidentified role of metformin in suppressing Cdk5 hyper-activation and thus preventing AD pathogenesis and suggested that metformin is a potential promising AD therapeutic drug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Single 30 Minutes Bout of Combination Physical Exercises Improved Inhibition and Vigor-Mood in Middle-Aged and Older Females: Evidence From a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Long-term combination of physical exercises has reported benefits for cognitive functions and mood states. However, it remains unclear whether a single bout of combination exercise training has acute positive effects on cognitive functions and mood states in middle-aged and older women. It is important to investigate acute effect of physical exercise because it would help to understand a mechanism of benefits of physical exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate 30 min of a single bout of combination exercise training on cognition and mood states in middle-aged and older females.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this single-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), middle-aged and older females were assigned randomly to two groups: a combination exercise group and a no-exercise control group. The former group did the combination exercise training (aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises) for 30 min. Meanwhile, the latter group did not do any exercise and waited for 30 min. We measured cognitive functions and mood performance states before and after the exercise or control interventions.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our main results demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the combination exercise improved inhibition (reverse Stroop and Stroop) and increased vigor–activity mood scores in both middle-aged and older groups. We also found that the only combination exercise group showed the significant positive correlations between improved inhibition performance and improved vigor–activity mood.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;This randomized controlled trial revealed the acute benefits of combination exercise on inhibition in executive functions and vigor–activity in the healthy middle-aged and older females. Our results provided the scientific evidence related to acute effects of the single bout of the combination exercise training. It suggests that we would be better to do the 30 min physical exercise for our health.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;This trial was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000029681).

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Calcium-Sensing Receptor Mediates β-Amyloid-Induced Synaptic Formation Impairment and Cognitive Deficits via Regulation of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2/Prostaglandin E2 Metabolic Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00144</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs). Soluble β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is one of the orthosteric modulators of CaSR, while, the role and underlying mechanism of CaSR in cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is unclear. In this study, molecular technology such as live-cell imaging combined with behavioral tests were used to explore the role and the underlying mechanism of CaSR in the cognitive deficits in AD mice. The expression levels of CaSR were increased both in AD mice and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; (β-amyloid protein)-treated primary cultured neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of CaSR ameliorated recognitive and spatial memory deficits of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-oligomer-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of CaSR or down-regulation of the expression of CaSR by CaSR-shRNA-lentivirus prevented the impairment of filopodia, and the synapse induced by oligomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;. The contents of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in hippocampal neurons and tissue were increased after treatment with Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; oligomers. Inhibition or down-regulation of CaSR mediates Aβ-induced synapse formation and cognitive deficits partially, through the activation of the cPLA2/PGE2 pathway. This study provides novel insights on CaSR, which is a promising therapeutic target for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The primary cilium constitutes a subcellular compartment that orchestrates signal transduction independent from the cell body. Ciliary dysfunction causes severe diseases, termed ciliopathies. Analyzing ciliary signaling has been challenging due to the lack of tools investigate ciliary signaling. Here, we describe a nanobody-based targeting approach for optogenetic tools in mammalian cells and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in zebrafish to specifically analyze ciliary signaling and function. Thereby, we overcome the loss of protein function observed after fusion to ciliary targeting sequences. We functionally localized modifiers of cAMP signaling, the photo-activated adenylate cyclase bPAC and the light-activated phosphodiesterase LAPD, and the cAMP biosensor mlCNBD-FRET to the cilium. Using this approach, we studied the contribution of spatial cAMP signaling in controlling cilia length. Combining optogenetics with nanobody-based targeting will pave the way to the molecular understanding of ciliary function in health and disease.</description>

	<title>eLife: Echinoderms provide missing link in the evolution of PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling</title>

	<description>Neuropeptide signalling systems comprising peptide ligands and cognate receptors are evolutionarily ancient regulators of physiology and behaviour. However, there are challenges associated with determination of orthology between neuropeptides in different taxa. Orthologs of vertebrate neuropeptide-Y (NPY) known as neuropeptide-F (NPF) have been identified in protostome invertebrates, whilst prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) and short neuropeptide-F (sNPF) have been identified as paralogs of NPY/NPF in vertebrates and protostomes, respectively. Here we investigated the occurrence of NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-related signalling systems in a deuterostome invertebrate phylum – the Echinodermata. Analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data revealed loss of NPY/NPF-type signalling, but orthologs of PrRP-type neuropeptides and sNPF/PrRP-type receptors were identified in echinoderms. Furthermore, experimental studies revealed that the PrRP-type neuropeptide pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a potent ligand for a sNPF/PrRP-type receptor in the starfish &lt;i&gt;Asterias rubens&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings indicate that PrRP-type and sNPF-type signalling systems are orthologous and originated as a paralog of NPY/NPF-type signalling in Urbilateria.</description>

	<title>eLife: Microglia TREM2R47H Alzheimer-linked variant enhances excitatory transmission and reduces LTP via increased TNF-α levels</title>

	<description>To study the mechanisms by which the p.R47H variant of the microglia gene and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factor TREM2 increases dementia risk, we created&lt;i&gt; Trem2&lt;sup&gt;R47H&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; KI rats. &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;sup&gt;R47H&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; rats were engineered to produce human Aβ to define human-Aβ-dependent and -independent pathogenic mechanisms triggered by this variant. Interestingly, pre- and peri-adolescent &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;sup&gt;R47H&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; rats present increased brain concentrations of TNF-α, augmented glutamatergic transmission, suppression of Long-term-Potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiological surrogate of learning and memory, but normal Ab levels. Acute reduction of TNF-α activity with a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody occludes the boost in amplitude of glutamatergic transmission and LTP suppression observed in young &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;sup&gt;R47H/R47H &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;rats. Thus, the microglia-specific pathogenic &lt;i&gt;Trem2 &lt;/i&gt;variant boosts glutamatergic neuronal transmission and suppresses LTP by increasing brain TNF-α concentrations, directly linking microglia to neuronal dysfunction. Future studies will determine whether this phenomenon represents an early, Aβ-independent pathway that facilitates dementia pathogenesis in humans.</description>

	<description>To date, microglia subsets in the healthy CNS have not been identified. Utilizing autofluorescence (AF) as a discriminating parameter, we identified two novel microglia subsets in both mice and non-human primates, termed autofluorescence-positive (AF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and negative (AF&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). While their proportion remained constant throughout most adult life, the AF signal linearly and specifically increased in AF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia with age and correlated with a commensurate increase in size and complexity of lysosomal storage bodies, as detected by transmission electron microscopy and LAMP1 levels. Post-depletion repopulation kinetics revealed AF&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells as likely precursors of AF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. At the molecular level, the proteome of AF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia showed overrepresentation of endolysosomal, autophagic, catabolic, and mTOR-related proteins. Mimicking the effect of advanced aging, genetic disruption of lysosomal function accelerated the accumulation of storage bodies in AF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and led to impaired microglia physiology and cell death, suggestive of a mechanistic convergence between aging and lysosomal storage disorders.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis for capsid recruitment and coat formation during HSV-1 nuclear egress</title>

	<description>During herpesvirus infection, egress of nascent viral capsids from the nucleus is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC). NEC deforms the inner nuclear membrane (INM) around the capsid by forming a hexagonal array. However, how the NEC coat interacts with the capsid and how curved coats are generated to enable budding is yet unclear. Here, by structure-guided truncations, confocal microscopy, and cryoelectron tomography, we show that binding of the capsid protein UL25 promotes the formation of NEC pentagons rather than hexagons. We hypothesize that during nuclear budding, binding of UL25 situated at the pentagonal capsid vertices to the NEC at the INM promotes formation of NEC pentagons that would anchor the NEC coat to the capsid. Incorporation of NEC pentagons at the points of contact with the vertices would also promote assembly of the curved hexagonal NEC coat around the capsid, leading to productive egress of UL25-decorated capsids.</description>

	<description>SynGAP is a synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) with four C-terminal splice variants: α1, α2, β, and γ. Although studies have implicated &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt; in several cognitive disorders, it is not clear which SynGAP isoforms contribute to disease. Here, we demonstrate that SynGAP isoforms exhibit unique spatiotemporal expression patterns and play distinct roles in neuronal and synaptic development in mouse neurons. SynGAP-α1, which undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation with PSD-95, is highly enriched in synapses and is required for LTP. In contrast, SynGAP-β, which does not bind PSD-95 PDZ domains, is less synaptically targeted and promotes dendritic arborization. A mutation in SynGAP-α1 that disrupts phase separation and synaptic targeting abolishes its ability to regulate plasticity and instead causes it to drive dendritic development like SynGAP-β. These results demonstrate that distinct intrinsic biochemical properties of SynGAP isoforms determine their function, and individual isoforms may differentially contribute to the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt;-related cognitive disorders.</description>

	<description>The neurotoxicity of air pollution is undefined for sex and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; alleles. These major risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were examined in mice given chronic exposure to nPM, a nano-sized subfraction of urban air pollution. In the cerebral cortex, female mice had two-fold more genes responding to nPM than males. Transcriptomic responses to nPM had sex-&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; interactions in AD-relevant pathways. Only &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;3 mice responded to nPM in genes related to Abeta deposition and clearance (&lt;i&gt;Vav2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vav3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S1009a&lt;/i&gt;). Other responding genes included axonal guidance, inflammation (AMPK, NFKB, APK/JNK signaling), and antioxidant signaling (NRF2, HIF1A). Genes downstream of NFKB and NRF2 responded in opposite directions to nPM. &lt;i&gt;Nrf2&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in microglia augmented NFKB responses to nPM, suggesting a critical role of NRF2 in air pollution neurotoxicity. These findings give a rationale for epidemiologic studies of air pollution to consider sex interactions with &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; alleles and other AD-risk genes.</description>

	<description>Adaptive action selection during stimulus categorization is an important feature of flexible behavior. To examine neural mechanism underlying this process, we trained mice to categorize the spatial frequencies of visual stimuli according to a boundary that changed between blocks of trials in a session. Using a model with a dynamic decision criterion, we found that sensory history was important for adaptive action selection after the switch of boundary. Bilateral inactivation of the secondary motor cortex (M2) impaired adaptive action selection by reducing the behavioral influence of sensory history. Electrophysiological recordings showed that M2 neurons carried more information about upcoming choice and previous sensory stimuli when sensorimotor association was being remapped than when it was stable. Thus, M2 causally contributes to flexible action selection during stimulus categorization, with the representations of upcoming choice and sensory history regulated by the demand to remap stimulus-action association.</description>

	<description>Precise temporal coordination of slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles is a fundamental mechanism of sleep-dependent memory consolidation. SO and spindle morphology changes considerably throughout development. Critically, it remains unknown how the precise temporal coordination of these two sleep oscillations develops during brain maturation and whether their synchronization indexes the development of memory networks. Here, we use a longitudinal study design spanning from childhood to adolescence, where participants underwent polysomnography and performed a declarative word-pair learning task. Performance on the memory task was better during adolescence. After disentangling oscillatory components from 1/f activity, we found frequency shifts within SO and spindle frequency bands. Consequently, we devised an individualized cross-frequency coupling approach, which demonstrates that SO-spindle coupling strength increases during maturation. Critically, this increase indicated enhanced memory formation from childhood to adolescence. Our results provide evidence that improved coordination between SOs and spindles indexes the development of sleep-dependent memory networks.</description>

	<description>A body of animal and human evidence points to the norepinephrine (NE) locus coeruleus (LC) system in modulating memory for arousing experiences, but whether the LC would recast its role along memory stages remains unknown. Sedation precluded examination of LC dynamics during memory processing in animals. Here, we addressed the contribution of the LC during arousal-associated memory processing through a unique combination of dedicated ultra-high-field LC-imaging methods, a well-established emotional memory task, online physiological and saliva alpha-amylase measurements in young adults. Arousal-related LC activation followed amygdala engagement during encoding. During consolidation and recollection, activation transitioned to hippocampal involvement, reflecting learning and model updating. NE-LC activation is dynamic, plays an arousal-controlling role, and is not sufficient but requires interactions with the amygdala to form adaptive memories of emotional experiences. These findings have implications for understanding contributions of LC dysregulation to disruptions in emotional memory formation, observed in psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders.</description>

	<description>While terrestrial locomotors often contend with permanently deformable substrates like sand, soil, and mud, principles of motion on such materials are lacking. We study the desert-specialist shovel-nosed snake traversing a model sand and find body inertia is negligible despite rapid transit and speed dependent granular reaction forces. New surface resistive force theory (RFT) calculation reveals how wave shape in these snakes minimizes material memory effects and optimizes escape performance given physiological power limitations. RFT explains the morphology and waveform-dependent performance of a diversity of non-sand-specialist snakes but overestimates the capability of those snakes which suffer high lateral slipping of the body. Robophysical experiments recapitulate aspects of these failure-prone snakes and elucidate how re-encountering previously deformed material hinders performance. This study reveals how memory effects stymied the locomotion of a diversity of snakes in our previous studies (Marvi et al., 2014) and indicates avenues to improve all-terrain robots.</description>

	<title>eLife: AR phosphorylation and CHK2 kinase activity regulates IR stabilized AR-CHK2 interaction and prostate cancer survival</title>

	<description>We have previously demonstrated that checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) is a critical negative regulator of androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth, and androgen sensitivity. We have now uncovered that the AR directly interacts with CHK2 and ionizing radiation (IR) increases this interaction. This IR-induced increase in AR–CHK2 interactions requires AR phosphorylation and CHK2 kinase activity. PCa associated CHK2 mutants with impaired kinase activity reduced IR-induced AR–CHK2 interactions. The destabilization of AR–CHK2 interactions induced by CHK2 variants impairs CHK2 negative regulation of cell growth. CHK2 depletion increases transcription of DNAPK and RAD54, increases clonogenic survival, and increases resolution of DNA double strand breaks. The data support a model where CHK2 sequesters the AR through direct binding decreasing AR transcription and suppressing PCa cell growth. CHK2 mutation or loss of expression thereby leads to increased AR transcriptional activity and survival in response to DNA damage.</description>

	<description>How cortical circuits build representations of complex objects is poorly understood. The massive dimensional expansion from the thalamus to the primary sensory cortex may enable sparse, comprehensive representations of higher order features to facilitate object identification. To generate such a code, cortical neurons must integrate broadly over space, yet simultaneously obtain sharp tuning to specific stimulus features. The logic of cortical integration that may synthesize such a sparse, high dimensional code for complex features is not known. To address this question, we probed the integration and population coding of higher order stimuli in the somatosensory and visual cortices of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging across cortical layers. We found that somatosensory and visual cortical neurons sum highly specific combinations of sensory inputs supra-linearly, but integrate other inputs sub-linearly, leading to selective responses to higher order features. This integrative process generates a sparse, but comprehensive code for complex stimuli from the earliest stages of cortical processing. These results from multiple sensory modalities imply that input-specific supra-linear summation may represent a widespread cortical mechanism for the synthesis of higher order feature codes. This new mechanism may explain how the brain exploits the thalamocortical expansion of dimensionality to encode arbitrary complex features of sensory stimuli.</description>

	<description>Humans naturally integrate signals from the olfactory and intranasal trigeminal systems. A tight interplay has been demonstrated between the two systems, but the underlying neural circuitry that mediate olfactory-trigeminal integration remains unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory-trigeminal integration. Fifteen subjects with normal olfactory function performed a localization task with weak or strong air-puff stimuli, phenylethyl alcohol (PEA; rose odor), or a combination. Although the ability to localize PEA to either nostril was at chance, its presence significantly improved the localization accuracy of weak, but not strong, air-puffs, relative to the localization of air-puffs without concomitant PEA, when both stimuli were delivered concurrently to the same nostril. This enhancement in localization accuracy was directly correlated with the magnitude of multisensory activity in the primary olfactory cortex (POC). Changes in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) multisensory activity alone could not predict task performance, but changes in OFC and POC connectivity could. Similar activity and connectivity patterns were observed in the superior temporal cortex (STC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and the cerebellum. Taken together, these results suggest that olfactory-trigeminal integration is occurring across multiple brain regions. These findings can be interpreted as an indication that the POC is part of a distributed brain network that mediate the integration between olfactory and trigeminal systems.</description>

	<description>A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last decade to overcome several drawbacks related to the persistent spiking paradigm. Memory items are maintained in the synaptic facilitation and refreshed thanks to Population Bursts (PBs) promoted by synaptic depression. We have developed a neural mass model able to reproduce exactly the dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks with short-term synaptic plasticity. This neural mass model gives access not only to the population firing rate, but also to the mean membrane potential. The latter is correlated to the Local Field Potentials and to electroencephalographic signals, usually measured during WM tasks to characterize the brain dynamics. The model is able to mimic several operations required by WM : memory loading, memory maintenance, competition of memory items and multi-item memory juggling. Memory access and loading is associated to self-sustained oscillations in the {beta}-{gamma} band and to transient evoked responses in the {delta} band, analougously to what observed in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys during object recognition tasks. More items can be stored in the WM by considering neural architectures composed by multiple excitatory populations and a common inhibitory pool. The items can be loaded and maintained at the same time: they are represented as trains of PBs with the same period, but delivered at evenly shifted phases. A memory competition is observable already by loading only two items. Depending on the stimulation features we can observe three different outcomes: maintenance of the first or second loaded item or their juggling in the memory. As reported in many experiments, the {gamma} power increases with the number of loaded items. The power in the -{beta} instead shows a non monotonic behaviour. Finally, we report an expression for the maximal capacity adapted to the present model and architecture.</description>

	<description>The hippocampus has been linked to memory encoding and spatial navigation, while the prefrontal cortex is associated with cognitive functions such as decision-making. These regions are hypothesized to communicate in tasks that demand both spatial navigation and decision-making processes. However, the electrophysiological signatures underlying this communication remain to be better elucidated. To investigate the dynamics of the hippocampal-prefrontal interactions, we have analyzed their local field potentials and spiking activity recorded from rats performing an odor-cued spatial alternation task in an 8-shaped maze. We found that the phase coherence of theta peaked around the choice point area of the maze. Moreover, Granger causality revealed a hippocampus-&amp;gt;prefrontal cortex directionality of information flow at theta frequency, peaking at starting areas of the maze, and on the reverse direction at delta frequency, peaking near the turn onset. Additionally, the patterns of phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling within and between the regions also showed spatial selectivity, and a new method revealed that hippocampal theta and prefrontal delta modulated not only gamma amplitude but also inter-regional gamma synchrony. Lastly, we found that the theta rhythm dynamically modulated neurons in both regions, with the highest modulation at the choice area; interestingly, prefrontal cortex neurons were more strongly modulated by the hippocampal theta rhythm than by their local field rhythm. In all, our results reveal maximum electrophysiological interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex near the decision-making period of the spatial alternation task. These results corroborate the hypothesis that a dynamic interplay between these regions takes place during spatial decisions.</description>

	<description>The manner through which individual differences in brain network organization track population-level behavioral variability is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. Recent work suggests that resting-state and task-state functional connectivity can predict specific traits at the individual level. However, the focus of most studies on single behavioral traits has come at the expense of capturing broader relationships across behaviors. Here, we utilized a large-scale dataset of 1858 typically developing children to estimate whole-brain functional network organization that is predictive of individual differences in cognition, impulsivity-related personality, and mental health during rest and task states. Predictive network features were distinct across the broad behavioral domains: cognition, personality and mental health. On the other hand, traits within each behavioral domain were predicted by highly similar network features. This is surprising given decades of research emphasizing that distinct brain networks support different mental processes. Although tasks are known to modulate the functional connectome, we found that predictive network features were similar between resting and task states. Overall, our findings reveal shared brain network features that account for individual variation within broad domains of behavior in childhood, yet are unique to different behavioral domains.</description>

	<description>Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) has challenged single-target therapeutic strategies, raising the possibility that combined therapies may offer a more effective treatment strategy. Objective: There is substantial evidence for the efficacy of leptin (L) (neuroprotective hormone) and pioglitazone (P) (anti-inflammatory agent) as monotherapies in AD. We have previouly shown that combination treatment of L+P in APP/PS1 mice at the onset of pathology significantly improved memory and reduced brain Abeta levels relative to control mice. In this new study, we sought to replicate our previous findings in a new cohort of APP/PS1 mouse to further confirm whether the combined treatment of L+P is superior to each treatment individually. Methods: We have re-evaluated the effects of L+P co-treatment in APP/PS1 mice using thioflavin-S staining, MOAbeta immunolabeling and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine effects on Abeta levels and pathology, relative to animals that received L or P individually. To explore mechanism of regulation, we used Western blotting to examine the expression of the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), due to its potential role in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Results: We demonstrated that combining L and P significantly enhances the anti-Abeta effect of L or P in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Western blot analysis indicated that Abeta reduction was accompanied by up-regulation of the PPARgamma levels. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that combining L and P significantly enhances the anti-Abeta effect of L or P in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, and may be a potential new effective strategy for AD therapy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A robust and self-sustained peripheral circadian oscillator reveals differences in temperature compensation properties with central brain clocks</title>

	<description>Circadian clocks temporally organize physiology and behavior of organisms exposed to the daily changes of light and temperature on our planet, thereby contributing to fitness and health. Circadian clocks and the biological rhythms they control are characterized by three properties. (1) The rhythms are self-sustained in constant conditions with a period of ~ 24 hr, (2), they can be synchronized to the environmental cycles of light and temperature, and (3), they are temperature compensated, meaning they run with the same speed at different temperatures within the physiological range of the organism. Apart from the central clocks located in or near the brain, which regulate the daily activity rhythms of animals, the so-called peripheral clocks are dispersed throughout the body of insects and vertebrates. Based on the three defining properties, it has been difficult to determine if these peripheral clocks are true circadian clocks. We used a set of clock gene-luciferase reporter genes to address this question in Drosophila circadian clocks. We show that self-sustained fly peripheral oscillators over compensate temperature changes, i.e., they slow down with increasing temperature. This over-compensation is not observed in central clock neurons in the fly brain, both in intact flies and in cultured brains, suggesting that neural network properties contribute to temperature compensation. However, an important neuropeptide for synchronizing the circadian neuronal network, the Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), is not required for self-sustained and temperature-compensated oscillations in subsets of the central clock neurons. Our findings reveal a fundamental difference between central and peripheral clocks, which likely also applies for vertebrate clocks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neural Flip-Flops II: Short-Term Memory and Electroencephalography</title>

	<description>For certain brain functions, the theoretical networks presented here almost certainly show how neurons are actually connected. Stripped of details such as redundancies and other error-correcting mechanisms, the basic organization of synaptic connections within some of the brain's building blocks is likely to be less complex than it appears. For some brain functions, the network architectures can even be quite simple. Flip-flops are the basic building blocks of sequential logic systems. Certain flip-flops can be configured to function as oscillators. The flip-flops and oscillators proposed here are composed of two to six neurons, and their operation depends only on minimal neuron capabilities of excitation and inhibition. These networks suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts. Oscillators can also generate major phenomena of electroencephalography. For example, cascaded oscillators can produce the periodic activity commonly known as brainwaves by enabling the state changes of many neural structures simultaneously. (The function of such oscillator-induced synchronization in information processing systems is timing error avoidance.) Then the boundary separating the alpha and beta frequency bands is 125/{d + {surd}[(d)2 + ({sigma}d)2ln(4)]} hertz, where d and {sigma}d are the mean and standard deviation (in milliseconds) of delay times of neurons that make up the initial oscillators in the cascades. With 4 and 1.5 ms being the best estimates for d and {sigma}d, respectively, this predicted boundary value is 14.9 Hz, which is within the range of commonly cited estimates obtained empirically from electroencephalograms (EEGs). The delay parameters d = 4 and {sigma}d = 1.5 also make predictions of the peaks and other boundaries of the five major EEG frequency bands that agree well with empirically estimated values. The hypothesis that cascaded oscillators produce EEG frequencies implies two EEG characteristics with no apparent function: The EEG gamma band has the same distribution of frequencies as three-neuron ring oscillators, and the ratios of peaks and boundaries of the major EEG bands are powers of two. These anomalous properties make it implausible that EEG phenomena are produced by a mechanism that is fundamentally different from cascaded oscillators. The cascaded oscillators hypothesis is supported by the available data for neuron delay times and EEG frequencies; the micro-level explanations of macro-level phenomena; the number, diversity, and precision of predictions of EEG phenomena; the simplicity of the oscillators and minimal required neuron capabilities; the selective advantage of timing error avoidance that cascaded oscillators can provide; and the implausibility of a fundamentally different mechanism producing the phenomena. The available data are too imprecise for a rigorous statistical test of the cascaded oscillators hypothesis. A simple, rigorous test of the hypothesis is suggested. The neuron delay parameters d and {sigma}d, as well as the mean and variance of the periods of one or more EEG bands, can be estimated from random samples. With standard tests for equal means and variances, the EEG sample statistics can be compared to the EEG parameters predicted by the delay time statistics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs</title>

	<description>Background: The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated. Methods: Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Strikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression. Conclusions: We demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.</description>

	<description>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is an important neuromodulator with wide distribution in the brain. Here, we screened the CRH-IRES-Cre;Ai32 mouse line to reveal the morphologies of individual CRH neurons throughout the mouse brain by using fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) system. Diverse dendritic morphologies and projection fibers were found in various brain regions. Reconstructions showed hypothalamic CRH neurons had the smallest somatic volumes and simplest dendritic branches, and CRH neurons in several regions shared a bipolar morphology. Further investigations in the medial prefrontal cortex unveiled somatic depth-dependent morphologies that exhibited three types of connections and CRH neurons in the anterior parvicellular area of hypothalamus had fewer and smaller Herring bodies whereas in the periventricular area had more and larger Herring bodies that were present within fibers projecting to the third ventricle. Our findings provide the most comprehensive intact morphologies of CRH neurons throughout the mouse brain that is currently available.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Visual mismatch responses index surprise signalling but not expectation suppression</title>

	<description>The ability to distinguish between commonplace and unusual sensory events is critical for efficient learning and adaptive behaviour. This has been investigated using oddball designs in which sequences of often-appearing (i.e. expected) stimuli are interspersed with rare (i.e. surprising) deviants. Resulting differences in electrophysiological responses following surprising compared to expected stimuli are known as visual mismatch responses (VMRs). VMRs are thought to index co-occurring contributions of stimulus repetition effects, expectation suppression (that occurs when ones expectations are fulfilled), and expectation violation (i.e. surprise) responses; however, these different effects have been conflated in existing oddball designs. To better isolate and quantify effects of expectation suppression and surprise, we adapted an oddball design based on Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) that controls for stimulus repetition effects. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants (N=48) viewed stimulation sequences in which a single face identity was periodically presented at 6 Hz. Critically, one of two different face identities (termed oddballs) appeared as every 7th image throughout the sequence. The presentation probabilities of each oddball image within a sequence varied between 10-90%, such that participants could form expectations about which oddball face identity was more likely to appear within each sequence. We also included expectation neutral 50% probability sequences, whereby consistently biased expectations would not be formed for either oddball face identity. We found that VMRs indexed surprise responses, and effects of expectation suppression were absent. That is, ERPs were more negative-going at occipitoparietal electrodes for surprising compared to neutral oddballs, but did not differ between expected and neutral oddballs. Surprising oddball-evoked ERPs were also highly similar across the 10-40% appearance probability conditions. Our findings indicate that VMRs which are not accounted for by repetition effects are best described as an all-or-none surprise response, rather than a minimisation of prediction error responses associated with expectation suppression.</description>

	<description>In recent years, a wealth of Drosophila neuroscience data have become available. These include cell type, connectome and synaptome datasets for both the larva and adult fly. To facilitate integration across data modalities and to accelerate the understanding of the functional logic of the fly brain, we developed an interactive computing environment called FlyBrainLab. FlyBrainLab is uniquely positioned towards accelerating the discovery of the functional logic of the Drosophila brain. Its interactive open source architecture seamlessly integrates and brings together computational models with neuroanatomical, neurogenetic and electrophysiological data, changing the organization of neuroscientific fly brain data from a group of unconnected databases, arrays and tables, to a well structured data and executable circuit repository. The FlyBrainLab User Interface supports a highly intuitive and automated workflow that streamlines the 3D exploration and visualization of fly brain circuits, and the interactive exploration of the functional logic of executable circuits created directly from the explored and visualized fly brain data. FlyBrainLab methodologically supports the efficient comparison of fly brain circuit models, across model instances developed by different researchers, across different developmental stages of the fruit fly and across different datasets. The FlyBrainLab Utility and Circuit Libraries accelerate the creation of models of executable circuits. The Utility Libraries help untangle the graph structure of neural circuits from raw connectome and synaptome data. The Circuit Libraries facilitate the exploration of neural circuits of the neuropils of the central complex and, the development and implementation of models of the adult and larva fruit fly early olfactory systems. To elevate its executable circuit construction capability beyond the connectome, FlyBrainLab provides additional libraries for molecular transduction arising in sensory coding in vision and olfaction. Together with sensory neuron activity data, these libraries serve as entry points for discovering circuit function in the sensory systems of the fruit fly brain. They also enable the biological validation of developed executable circuits within the same platform.</description>

	<description>In the mouse, retinal output is computed by over 40 distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (Baden et al., 2016). Determining which of these many RGC types project to a retinorecipient region is a key step in elucidating the role that region plays in visually-mediated behaviors. Combiningretrograde viral tracing and single-cell electrophysiology, we identify the RGC types which project to the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), a major visual structure. We find that retinal input to the OPN consists of a variety of intrinsically-photosensitive and conventional RGC types, the latter a diverse set of mostly ON RGCs. Surprisingly, while the OPN is most associated with the pupillary light reflex (PLR) pathway, requiring information about absolute luminance, we show that the majority of the retinal input to the OPN is from single cell type which transmits information unrelated to luminance. This ON-transient RGC accounts for two-thirds of the input to the OPN, and responds to small objects across a wide range of speeds. This finding suggests a rolefor the OPN in visually-mediated behaviors beyond the PLR.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Response preparation involves a release of intracortical inhibition in task-irrelevant muscles</title>

	<description>Action preparation involves widespread modulation of motor system excitability, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we investigated whether intracortical inhibition changes in task-irrelevant muscle representations during action preparation. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electromyography in healthy human adults to measure motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cortical silent periods (CSPs) in task-irrelevant muscles during the preparatory period of simple delayed response tasks. In Experiment 1, participants responded with the left-index finger in one task condition and the right-index finger in another task condition, while MEPs and CSPs were measured from the contralateral non-responding and tonically contracted index finger. During Experiment 2, participants responded with the right pinky finger while MEPs and CSPs were measured from the tonically contracted left-index finger. In both experiments, MEPs and CSPs were compared between the task preparatory period and a resting intertrial baseline. The CSP duration during response preparation decreased from baseline in every case. A laterality difference was also observed in Experiment 1, with a greater CSP reduction during the preparation of left finger responses compared to right finger responses. MEP amplitudes showed no modulation during movement preparation in any of the three response conditions. These findings indicate cortical inhibition associated with task-irrelevant muscles is transiently released during action preparation and implicate a novel mechanism for the controlled and coordinated release of motor cortex inhibition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hypomyelination leads to alterations in inhibitory function and parvalbumin-positive neuron density in the auditory cortex</title>

	<description>Myelination of central nervous system axons increases the conduction speed of neural impulses and contributes to the function and maintenance of neural circuits. Accordingly, loss of myelin leads to axonal loss and to severe brain dysfunction. In contrast, much less is known about the functional consequences of mild hypomyelination on central network connectivity. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied mice that have mild hypomyelination due to loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB receptor signaling. We focused on the primary auditory cortex (A1) due to the crucial role that temporal precision plays in the processing of auditory information. We find that loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB receptor signaling causes reduction in myelin in A1. We mapped and quantified the intracortical inputs to L2/3 neurons using laser-scanning photostimulation combined with patch clamp recordings. We found that hypomyelination reduces inhibitory connections to L2/3 neurons without affecting excitatory inputs, thus altering excitatory/inhibitory balance. Remarkably, these effects are not associated with changes in the expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic components, but with a reduction of parvalbumin (PV) neuron density and PV mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that mild hypomyelination can impact cortical neuronal networks and cause a network shift towards excitation.</description>

	<description>Maintaining stable body temperature through environmental thermal stressors requires detection of temperature changes, relay of information, and coordination of physiological and behavioral responses. Studies have implicated areas in the preoptic hypothalamic area (POA) and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) as nodes in the thermosensory neural circuitry and indicate the opioid system within the POA is vital in regulating body temperate. In the present study, we identify neurons projecting to the POA from PBN expressing the opioid peptides Dynorphin (Dyn) and Enkephalin (Enk). We determine that warm-activated PBN neuronal populations overlap with both Dyn and Enk expressing PBN populations. We demonstrate that Dyn and Enk expressing neurons are partially overlapping subsets of a glutamatergic population in the PBN. Using optogenetic approaches we selectively activate projections in the POA from PBN Dyn, Enk, and VGLUT2 expressing neurons. Our findings demonstrate that Dyn, Enk, and VGLUT2 expressing PBN neurons are critical for physiological and behavioral heat defense.</description>

	<description>Recent advances in virtual reality and robotic technologies have allowed researchers to explore the mechanisms underlying bodily aspects of self-consciousness which are largely attributed to the multisensory and sensorimotor processing of bodily signals (bodily self-consciousness, BSC). One key contribution to BSC, that is currently poorly addressed due to the lack of a wearable solution, concerns realistic collision sensations on the torso. Here, we introduce and validate a novel torso-worn force display, the Cogno-vest, to provide mechanical touch on the user's back in a sensorimotor perception experiment. In a first empirical study, we characterized human finger poking (N=28). In order to match these poking characteristics and meet the wearability criteria, we used bi-directional, push-pull solenoids as a force actuator in the Cogno-vest. Subsequently, and based on an iterative, multidisciplinary design procedure, a body-conforming, unisex, torso-worn force display was prototyped. Finally, we conducted a behavioral study that investigated BSC in 25 healthy participants by introducing conflicting sensorimotor signals between their hand and torso (back). Using the final reiteration of the Cogno-vest we successfully replicated previous findings on illusory states of BSC, characterized by presence hallucinations (PH) and passivity symptoms, and achieved higher illusion ratings compared to static conditions used in prior studies.</description>

	<description>Attentional lapses are ubiquitous and can negatively impact performance. They correlate with mind wandering, or thoughts that are unrelated to ongoing tasks and environmental demands. In other cases, the stream of consciousness itself comes to a halt and the mind goes blank. What happens in the brain that leads to these mental states? To understand the neural mechanisms underlying attentional lapses, we cross-analyzed the behavior, subjective experience and neural activity of healthy participants performing a task. Random interruptions prompted participants to indicate whether they were task-focused, mind-wandering or mind-blanking. High-density electroencephalography revealed the occurrence of spatially and temporally localized sleep-like patterns of neural activity. This 'local sleep' accompanied behavioral markers of lapses and preceded reports of mind wandering and mind blanking. Furthermore, the location of local sleep distinguished sluggish versus impulsive behaviors, mind wandering versus mind blanking. Despite contrasting cognitive profiles, attentional lapses could share a common physiological origin: the appearance of local islets of sleep within the awake brain.</description>

	<description>Attentional control outside of the laboratory operates in multisensory settings, but the development of mechanisms subserving such control remains poorly understood. We investigated when, over the course of childhood, adult-like attentional control mechanisms begin to emerge. Children aged five, seven, and nine were compared with adults on behavioural performance in a computer game-like multisensory spatial cueing task, while simultaneous 129-channel EEG was recorded. Markers of attentional control were behavioural spatial cueing effects and the N2pc ERP component (analysed both traditionally and using a novel, multivariate electrical neuroimaging framework). In behaviour, adult-like visual attentional control was present from age 7 onwards, whereas multisensory control was not seen in children. In EEG, multivariate analyses of the activity over the N2pc time-window, revealed stable patterns of brain activity in children. Adult activity patterns linked to visual attentional control were present age 7 onwards, mirroring behaviour. Activity patterns linked to multisensory control were found in 9-year-olds, even though such patterns were not noted in behaviour. By combining rigorous yet naturalistic paradigms with multivariate signal analyses, we provided new insights into the development of visual attentional control skills vis-a-vis multisensory attentional control, thus generating a more complete account of attentional development.</description>

	<description>In the mammalian cerebral cortex, the developmental events governing the allocation of different classes of inhibitory interneurons (INs) into distinct cortical layers are poorly understood. Here we report that the guidance receptor PlexinA4 (PLXNA4) is upregulated in serotonin receptor 3a-expressing (HTR3A+) cortical INs (hINs) as they invade the cortical plate and that it regulates their laminar allocation to superficial cortical layers. We find that the PLXNA4 ligand Semaphorin3A (SEMA3A) acts as a chemorepulsive factor on hINs migrating into the nascent cortex and demonstrate that SEMA3A specifically controls their laminar positioning through PLXNA4. We identify that deep layer INs constitute a major source of SEMA3A in the developing cortex and demonstrate that cell-type specific genetic deletion of SEMA3A in these INs specifically affects the laminar allocation of hINs. These data demonstrate that in the neocortex, deep layer INs control the laminar allocation of hINs into superficial layers.</description>

	<description>Gonadal hormones affect neuronal morphology to ultimately regulate behavior. Here, we investigated the effect of both castration and androgen replacement on spine plasticity in the nucleus accumbens shell and core (NAcSh and NAcC), caudate putamen (CPu), medial amygdala (MeA), and medial preoptic nucleus (MPN). Intact and castrated (GDX) male rats were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 1.5mg) or vehicle (oil) in 3 experimental groups: intact-oil, GDX-oil and GDX-DHT. Spine density and morphology, measured 24 hours after injection, were determined through 3D reconstruction of DiI-labeled dendritic segments. GDX decreased spine density in the MPN, which was rescued by DHT treatment. MeA spine density increased in GDX-DHT animals compared to intact-oil animals. In the NAcSh, DHT decreased spine density, and also rapidly increased the number of pCREB+ cell bodies. These findings indicate that androgen signaling plays a role in the regulation of spine plasticity within neurocircuits involved in motivated behaviors.</description>

	<description>Our brains at rest spontaneously replay recently acquired information, but how this process is orchestrated to avoid interference with ongoing cognition is an open question. We investigated whether replay coincided with spontaneous patterns of whole brain activity. We found, in two separate datasets, that replay sequences were packaged into transient bursts occurring selectively during activation of the default mode network (DMN) and parietal alpha network. These networks were characterized by widespread synchronized oscillations coupled to increases in ripple band power, mechanisms that coordinate information flow between disparate cortical areas. Our data show a tight correspondence between two widely studied phenomena of neural physiology and suggest the DMN may coordinate replay bursts in a manner that minimizes interference with ongoing cognition.</description>

	<description>Spontaneous fluctuations of neural activity have been shown to influence trial-by-trial variation in perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes. This implies that these fluctuations affect stimulus-related neural processes, and hence should affect stimulus-evoked neural activity. However, the mechanisms by which spontaneous neural activity shapes stimulus-evoked neural activity have rarely been examined. Employing a large-scale magnetoencephalographic dataset, as well as an electroencephalographic replication dataset, we observed that for high-frequency power, high pre-stimulus activity leads to greater evoked desynchronization (negative interaction); in contrast, for low-frequency power, high pre-stimulus activity induces greater event-related synchronization (positive interaction). We show that both positive and negative interactions are manifest primarily in cortical oscillations, rather than scale-free activity, and can also be observed in the time domain. In summary, we demonstrate positive and negative spontaneous-evoked interaction in multiple electrophysiological processes; these mechanisms &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between spontaneous and evoked activity and provide novel insights into how spontaneous activity influences behaviour and cognition.</description>

	<description>Aberrant neural oscillations hallmark numerous brain disorders. Here, we first report a method to track the phase of neural oscillations in real-time via endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) that mitigates the characteristic Gibbs distortion. We then used ecHT to show that the aberrant neural oscillation that hallmarks essential tremor (ET) syndrome, the most common adult movement disorder, can be noninvasively suppressed via electrical stimulation of the cerebellum phase-locked to the tremor. The tremor suppression is sustained after the end of the stimulation and can be phenomenologically predicted. Finally, using feature-based statistical-learning and neurophysiological-modelling we show that the suppression of ET is mechanistically attributed to a disruption of the temporal coherence of the oscillation via perturbation of the tremor generating a cascade of synchronous activity in the olivocerebellar loop. The suppression of aberrant neural oscillation via phase-locked driven disruption of temporal coherence may represent a powerful neuromodulatory strategy to treat brain disorders.</description>

	<description>The amygdala and prelimbic cortex (PL) communicate during fear discrimination retrieval, but how they coordinate to discriminate a non-threatening stimulus is unknown. Here, we show that somatostatin interneurons (SOM) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) activate specifically during learned non-threatening cues and block sensory-evoked phase resetting of theta-oscillations. SOM activation is PL-dependent, and prevents generalization. Thus, fear discrimination engages PL-dependent coordination of BLA responses to non-threatening stimuli.</description>

	<description>The multi-echo gradient echo (ME-GRE) magnetic resonance signal evolution in white matter has a strong dependence on the orientation of myelinated axons in respect to the main static field. Although analytical solutions, based on the Hollow Cylinder Model have been able to predict some of the behaviour the hollow cylinder model, it has been shown that realistic models of white matter offer a better description of the signal behaviout observed. In this work, we present a pipeline to (i) generate realistic 2D white matter models with its microstructure based on real axon but with arbitrary fiber volume fraction (FVF) and g-ratio. We (ii) simulate their interaction with the static magnetic field to be able to simulate their MR signal. For the first time, we (iii) demonstrate that realistic 2D models can be used to simulate an MR signal that provides a good approximation of the signal obtained from a real 3D white matter model obtained using electron microscopy. We then (iv) demonstrate in silico that 2D WM models can be used to predict microstructural parameters in a robust way if multi-echo multi-orientation data is available and the main fiber orientation in each pixel is known using DTI. A Deep Learning Network was trained and characterized in its ability to recover the desired microstructural parameters such as FVF, g-ratio, free and bound water transverse relaxation and magnetic susceptibility. Finally, the network was trained to recover these micro-structural parameters from an ex-vivo dataset acquired in 9-orientations in respect to the magnetic field and 12 echo times. We demonstrate that this is an overdetermined problem and that as few as 3 orientations can already provide comparable results for some of the decoded metrics. [Highlights] - A pipeline to generate realistic white matter models of arbitrary fiber volume fraction and g-ratio is presented; - We present a methodology to simulated the gradient echo signal from segmented 2D and 3D models of white matter, which takes into account the interaction of the static magnetic field with the anisotropic susceptibility of the myelin phospholipids; - Deep Learning Networks can be used to decode microstructural white matter parameters from the signal of multi-echo multi-orientation data;</description>

	<description>The idea to combine in vivo functional imaging with optogenetic stimulation to achieve closed-loop, all-optical recording and manipulation of neurons and neural circuits is appealing yet challenging. Other than necessary hardwares, it requires an analysis software fast enough to extract neural activities from imaging data in real time. Here we present an open-source, integrative image processing toolbox ORACA (Online Real-time Activity extraction and offline Cross-session Analysis), which provides solutions for both fast online and accurate offline data analyses. We developed fast GPU-based algorithms that can finish raw image registration, automatic identification and activity extraction of neurons within seconds after image acquisition. Offline analysis pipeline features a new cross-session alignment algorithm that takes into account the angle differences across imaging sessions, useful for shared microscope or long imaging intervals. A modular, user-friendly software that can be used as a complete package or independent modules, ORACA can effectively facilitate the image analysis process, especially for all-optical closed-loop control and long-term repeated imaging.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Somatic hypermutation analysis for improved identification of B cell clonal families from next-generation sequencing data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nima Nouri, Steven H. Kleinstein&lt;/p&gt;

Adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) offers the possibility of identifying and tracking B cell clonal expansions during adaptive immune responses. Members of a B cell clone are descended from a common ancestor and share the same initial V(D)J rearrangement, but their B cell receptore (BCR) sequence may differ due to the accumulation of somatic hypermutations (SHMs). Clonal relationships are learned from AIRR-seq data by analyzing the BCR sequence, with the most common methods focused on the highly diverse junction region. However, clonally related cells often share SHMs which have been accumulated during affinity maturation. Here, we investigate whether shared SHMs in the V and J segments of the BCR can be leveraged along with the junction sequence to improve the ability to identify clonally related sequences. We develop independent distance functions that capture junction similarity and shared mutations, and combine these in a spectral clustering framework to infer the BCR clonal relationships. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that this model improves both the sensitivity and specificity for identifying B cell clones. Source code for this method is freely available in the SCOPer (Spectral Clustering for clOne Partitioning) R package (version 0.2 or newer) in the Immcantation framework: www.immcantation.org under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HfQLvDZokdE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Implantation is initiated when an embryo attaches to the uterine luminal epithelium and subsequently penetrates into the underlying stroma to firmly embed in the endometrium. These events are followed by the formation of an extensive vascular network in the stroma that supports embryonic growth and ensures successful implantation. Interestingly, in...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/mWQZHl6UxLY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Large-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-activated K+ (BK) channels control membrane excitability in many cell types. BK channels are tetrameric. Each subunit is composed of a voltage sensor domain (VSD), a central pore-gate domain, and a large cytoplasmic domain (CTD) that contains the Ca2+ sensors. While it is known that BK channels...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/aTsgedE65BY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The nanoscale co-organization of neurotransmitter receptors facing presynaptic release sites is a fundamental determinant of their coactivation and of synaptic physiology. At excitatory synapses, how endogenous AMPARs, NMDARs, and mGluRs are co-organized inside the synapse and their respective activation during glutamate release are still unclear.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the associations between the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and hippocampal subfields in 127 healthy participants (18–85 years). MRI datasets were collected on a 4.7 T system. Participants were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale to evaluate episodic memory function. Significant associations of both polymorphisms were present only in older adults (≥50 years). BDNF polymorphism was associated with larger dentate gyrus volumes within the anterior hippocampus (head) in Met‐carriers compared to Val/Val homozygotes. We found that in Met‐carriers total hippocampal volume predicted performance on visuospatial memory tasks. APOE polymorphism was associated with larger total hippocampal volume, especially in cornu ammonis 1–3 and subiculum in APOE ɛ2 carriers compared to both ɛ4 and ɛ3 carriers, while APOE ɛ3 and ɛ4 carriers did not differ from each other. APOE polymorphism was associated with better performance on visuospatial memory tasks in APOE ε2 carriers in comparison to ε4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Morphometric Analysis of the Corpus Callosum According to Age and Sex in Middle Eastern Arabs: Racial Comparisons and Clinical Correlations to Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00030</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00030</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study sought to examine the influence of age and sex on morphometric measurements of the corpus callosum (CC) within Middle Eastern Arab population, in order to obtain reference data and conduct racial comparisons with previously reported measurements from other ethnicities. Furthermore, it aimed to investigate CC variations that may occur in children with autism. To this end, magnetic resonance images of normal brains were acquired from three different age groups, consisting of children, younger adults, and older adults. Brain images were also acquired from boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The CC length, area, and thickness were measured. The CC length was smaller in children than in the other age groups, but no difference in CC length was found between younger and older adults. The CC area and thickness were greater in younger adults than in children and older adults, and greater in older adults than in children. With regard to sexual dimorphism, the CC area and forebrain volume were larger in male children than in female children. No sex-related differences in CC area or thickness were found in adults. However, the ratio of CC area to the forebrain volume was greater in adult females than in males, owing to the smaller forebrain volume in females. The absolute length of the CC was greater in older adult males than in their female counterparts. In addition, significant differences in CC measurements were found in comparison to measurements obtained from other ethnicities. Lastly, significant reductions in CC area and thickness were found in boys with ASD compared to their neurotypical peers. In conclusion, age and sex significantly influence morphometric measurements of CC in Middle Eastern Arab population. This study points to the presence of racial differences in CC size. Finally, it reveals that children with ASD display a distinct reduction in CC size compared to neurotypical children of the same ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Effects of ASC Application on Endplate Regeneration Upon Glycerol-Induced Muscle Damage</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amongst other approaches, adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) have recently been tested with respect to their regenerative capacity for treatment of neuromuscular disorders. While beneficial effects of ASCs on muscle recovery were observed previously, their impact on regeneration of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is unclear. Here, we used a murine glycerol damage model to study disruption and regeneration of NMJs and to evaluate the effects of systemic application of ASCs on muscle and NMJ recovery. In mice that were not treated with ASCs, a differential response of NMJ pre- and post-synapses to glycerol-induced damage was observed. While post-synapses were still present in regions that were necrotic and lacking actin and dystrophin, pre-synapses disappeared soon in those affected areas. Partial regeneration of NMJs occurred within 11 days after damage. ASC treatment slightly enhanced NMJ recovery and reduced the loss of presynaptic sites, but also led to a late phase of muscle necrosis and fibrosis. In summary, the results suggest a differential sensitivity of NMJ pre- and post-synapses to glycerol-induced muscle damage and that the use of ASC for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders needs further careful evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Circulating microRNAs Profile in Patients With Transthyretin Variant Amyloidosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00102</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transthyretin variant amyloidosis (ATTRv) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid in many organs, mostly causing a sensory-motor neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and dysautonomia. The aim of the study was to report microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile identified in the blood of ATTRv patients. Ten ATTRv patients, 10 asymptomatic carriers of transthyretin variant (TTRv), 10 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, and 10 healthy controls were studied. Human Schwann cells cultures were used to study the regulatory effects of miR-150-5p on the expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF). ATTRv patients had 33 miRNAs up-regulated and 48 down-regulated versus healthy controls; 9 miRNAs were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated versus CMT patients; 19 miRNAs were up-regulated and 38 down-regulated versus asymptomatic TTRv carriers. Twelve out of the 19 upregulated miRNAs had a fold increase higher than 100. The validation experiment indicated miR-150-5p as a valuable biomarker to differentiate ATTRv patients from asymptomatic TTRv carriers (AUC: 0.9728; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Schwann cells culture model demonstrated that miR-150-5p is a powerful negative regulator of CREB, BDNF, and NGF genes. Identification of deregulated miRNAs can help in understanding the complex pathomechamism underlying the development of ATTRv and related multisystemic pathology. Further investigations are needed on the role of circulating miR-150-5p to predict the shift of TTRv carriers from an asymptomatic status to symptoms appearance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Effective Connectivity of Bilateral Hippocampus in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00657</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00657</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experience cognitive deficits but the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not known. We therefore applied Granger causality analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the effective connectivity (EC) of the hippocampus in patients with T2DM. Eighty six patients with T2DM and 84 matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The directional EC between anatomically defined seeds in left hippocampus (LHIP) and right hippocampus (RHIP) and other brain regions was compared between T2DM and HC and Pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine whether alterations in EC were related to clinical characteristics of diabetes. Compared with HC, patients with T2DM had altered EC between LHIP and RHIP and the default mode network (DMN), occipital cortex and cerebellum. In addition, for LHIP only duration of diabetes positively correlated with decreased inflow from right postcentral gyrus and right parietal lobe, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) negatively correlated with decreased inflow from right thalamus (r = −0.255, p = 0.018) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) negatively correlated with decreased inflow from left inferior parietal lobe (r = −0.206, p = 0.05). The altered EC between hippocampus and DMN is interpreted to be related to cognitive deficits in patients with T2DM particularly affecting memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Non-photoreceptor Expression of Tulp1 May Contribute to Extensive Retinal Degeneration in Tulp1-/- Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00656</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00656</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in tubby like protein 1 gene (TULP1) are causative of early-onset recessive inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs); similarly, the Tulp1-/- mouse is also characterized by a rapid IRD. Tulp1 mRNA and protein expression was analyzed in wild type mouse retinas and expression data sets (NCBI) during early postnatal development. Comparative histology was undertaken in Tulp1-/-, rhodopsin-/- (Rho-/-) and retinal degeneration slow-/- (Rds-/-) mouse retinas. Bioinformatic analysis of predicted TULP1 interactors and IRD genes was performed. Peak expression of Tulp1 in healthy mouse retinas was detected at p8; of note, TULP1 was detected in both the outer and inner retina. Bioinformatic analysis indicated Tulp1 expression in retinal progenitor, photoreceptor and non-photoreceptor cells. While common features of photoreceptor degeneration were detected in Tulp1-/-, Rho-/-, and Rds-/- retinas, other alterations in bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells were specific to Tulp1-/- mice. Additionally, predicted TULP1 interactors differed in various retinal cell types and new functions for TULP1 were suggested. A pilot bioinformatic analysis indicated that in a similar fashion to Tulp1, many other IRD genes were expressed in both inner and outer retinal cells at p4–p7. Our data indicate that expression of Tulp1 extends to multiple retinal cell types; lack of TULP1 may lead to primary degeneration not only of photoreceptor but also non-photoreceptor cells. Predicted interactors suggest widespread retinal functions for TULP1. Early and widespread expression of TULP1 and some other IRD genes in both the inner and outer retina highlights potential hurdles in the development of treatments for these IRDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: KTN1 Variants Underlying Putamen Gray Matter Volumes and Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Selective loss of dopaminergic neurons and diminished putamen gray matter volume (GMV) represents a central feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent studies have reported specific effects of kinectin 1 gene (KTN1) variants on the putamen GMV.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine the relationship of KTN1 variants, KTN1 mRNA expression in the putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), putamen GMV, and PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined the associations between PD and a total of 1847 imputed KTN1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in one discovery sample [2,000 subjects with PD vs. 1,986 healthy controls (HC)], and confirmed the nominally significant associations (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in two replication samples (900 PD vs. 867 HC, and 940 PD vs. 801 HC, respectively). The regulatory effects of risk variants on the KTN1 mRNA expression in putamen and SNc and the putamen GMV were tested. We also quantified the expression levels of KTN1 mRNA in the putamen and/or SNc for comparison between PD and HC in five independent cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Six replicable and two non-replicable KTN1-PD associations were identified (0.009 ≤ p ≤ 0.049). The major alleles of five SNPs, including rs12880292, rs8017172, rs17253792, rs945270, and rs4144657, significantly increased risk for PD (0.020 ≤ p ≤ 0.049) and putamen GMVs (19.08 ≤ β ≤ 60.38; 2.82 ≤ Z ≤ 15.03; 5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–51&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ p ≤ 0.018). The risk alleles of five SNPs, including rs8017172, rs17253792, rs945270, rs4144657, and rs1188184 also significantly increased the KTN1 mRNA expression in the putamen or SNc (0.021 ≤ p ≤ 0.046). The KTN1 mRNA was abundant in the putamen and/or SNc across five independent cohorts and differentially expressed in the SNc between PD and HC in one cohort (p = 0.047).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There was a consistent, significant, replicable, and robust positive relationship among the KTN1 variants, PD risk, KTN1 mRNA expression in putamen, and putamen volumes, and a modest relation between PD risk and KTN1 mRNA expression in SNc, suggesting that KTN1 may play a functional role in the development of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain-computer interface (BCI) provides an alternative means to communicate and it has sparked growing interest in the past two decades. Specifically, for Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based BCI, marked improvement has been made in the frequency recognition method and data sharing. However, the number of pubic databases is still limited in this field. Therefore, we present a BEnchmark database Towards BCI Application (BETA) in the study. The BETA database is composed of 64-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 70 subjects performing a 40-target cued-spelling task. The design and the acquisition of the BETA are in pursuit of meeting the demand from real-world applications and it can be used as a test-bed for these scenarios. We validate the database by a series of analyses and conduct the classification analysis of eleven frequency recognition methods on BETA. We recommend using the metric of wide-band signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and BCI quotient to characterize the SSVEP at the single-trial and population levels, respectively. The BETA database can be downloaded from the following link http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Phospho-HDAC6 Gathers Into Protein Aggregates in Parkinson’s Disease and Atypical Parkinsonisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;HDAC6 is a unique histone deacetylase that targets cytoplasmic non-histone proteins and has a specific ubiquitin-binding activity. Both of these activities are required for HDAC6-mediated formation of aggresomes, which contain misfolded proteins that will ultimately be degraded via autophagy. HDAC6 deacetylase activity is increased following phosphorylation on serine 22 (phospho-HDAC6). In human, HDAC6 localizes in neuronal Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and in oligodendrocytic Papp–Lantos bodies in multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, the expression of phospho-HDAC6 in post-mortem human brains is currently unexplored. Here, we evaluate and compare the distribution of HDAC6 and its phosphorylated form in human brains obtained from patients affected by three forms of parkinsonism: two synucleinopathies (PD and MSA) and a tauopathy (progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP). We find that both HDAC6 and its phosphorylated form localize with pathological protein aggregates, including α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies in PD and Papp–Lantos bodies in MSA, and phospho-tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles in PSP. We further find a direct interaction of HDAC6 with α-synuclein with proximity ligation assay (PLA) in neuronal cell of PD patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that both HDAC6 and phospho-HDAC6 regulate the homeostasis of intra-neuronal proteins in parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Enhanced Accuracy for Multiclass Mental Workload Detection Using Long Short-Term Memory for Brain–Computer Interface</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive workload is one of the widely invoked human factors in the areas of human–machine interaction (HMI) and neuroergonomics. The precise assessment of cognitive and mental workload (MWL) is vital and requires accurate neuroimaging to monitor and evaluate the cognitive states of the brain. In this study, we have decoded four classes of MWL using long short-term memory (LSTM) with 89.31% average accuracy for brain–computer interface (BCI). The brain activity signals are acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region of the brain. We performed a supervised MWL experimentation with four varying MWL levels on 15 participants (both male and female) and 10 trials of each MWL per participant. Real-time four-level MWL states are assessed using fNIRS system, and initial classification is performed using three strong machine learning (ML) techniques, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and artificial neural network (ANN) with obtained average accuracies of 54.33, 54.31, and 69.36%, respectively. In this study, novel deep learning (DL) frameworks are proposed, which utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM with 87.45 and 89.31% average accuracies, respectively, to solve high-dimensional four-level cognitive states classification problem. Statistical analysis, t-test, and one-way F-test (ANOVA) are also performed on accuracies obtained through ML and DL algorithms. Results show that the proposed DL (LSTM and CNN) algorithms significantly improve classification performance as compared with ML (SVM, ANN, and k-NN) algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Review of Sensory Feedback in Upper-Limb Prostheses From the Perspective of Human Motor Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00345</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This manuscript reviews historical and recent studies that focus on supplementary sensory feedback for use in upper limb prostheses. It shows that the inability of many studies to speak to the issue of meaningful performance improvements in real-life scenarios is caused by the complexity of the interactions of supplementary sensory feedback with other types of feedback along with other portions of the motor control process. To do this, the present manuscript frames the question of supplementary feedback from the perspective of computational motor control, providing a brief review of the main advances in that field over the last 20 years. It then separates the studies on the closed-loop prosthesis control into distinct categories, which are defined by relating the impact of feedback to the relevant components of the motor control framework, and reviews the work that has been done over the last 50+ years in each of those categories. It ends with a discussion of the studies, along with suggestions for experimental construction and connections with other areas of research, such as machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modulation of Intrinsic Brain Connectivity by Implicit Electroencephalographic Neurofeedback</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00192</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00192</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing popularity of neurofeedback, its mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. This study aims to describe the processes underlying implicit electroencephalographic neurofeedback. Fifty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a single session of infra-low frequency neurofeedback or sham neurofeedback, with electrodes over the right middle temporal gyrus and the right inferior parietal lobule. They observed a moving rocket, the speed of which was modulated by the waveform derived from a band-limited infra-low frequency filter. Immediately before and after the session, the participants underwent a resting-state fMRI. Network-based statistical analysis was applied, comparing post- vs. pre-session and real vs. sham neurofeedback conditions. As a result, two phenomena were observed. First, we described a brain circuit related to the implicit neurofeedback process itself, consisting of the lateral occipital cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, right ventral striatum, and bilateral dorsal striatum. Second, we found increased connectivity between key regions of the salience, language, and visual networks, which is indicative of integration in sensory processing. Thus, it appears that a single session of implicit infra-low frequency electroencephalographic neurofeedback leads to significant changes in intrinsic brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Object Recognition at Higher Regions of the Ventral Visual Stream via Dynamic Inference</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral visual stream (VVS) is a fundamental pathway involved in visual object identification and recognition. In this work, we present a hypothesis of a sequence of computations performed by the VVS during object recognition. The operations performed by the inferior temporal (IT) cortex are represented as not being akin to a neural-network, but rather in-line with a dynamic inference instantiation of the untangling notion. The presentation draws upon a technique for dynamic maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) sequence estimation based on the Viterbi algorithm. Simulation results are presented to show that the decoding portion of the architecture that is associated with the IT can effectively untangle object identity when presented with synthetic data. More importantly, we take a step forward in visual neuroscience by presenting a framework for an inference-based approach that is biologically inspired via attributes implicated in primate object recognition. The analysis will provide insight in explaining the exceptional proficiency of the VVS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Collapsin Response Mediator Proteins: Their Biological Functions and Pathophysiology in Neuronal Development and Regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00188</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00188</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs), which consist of five homologous cytosolic proteins, are one of the major phosphoproteins in the developing nervous system. The prominent feature of the CRMP family proteins is a new class of microtubule-associated proteins that play important roles in the whole process of developing the nervous system, such as axon guidance, synapse maturation, cell migration, and even in adult brain function. The CRMP C-terminal region is subjected to posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, which, in turn, regulates the interaction between the CRMPs and various kinds of proteins including receptors, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins, and motor proteins. The gene-knockout of the CRMP family proteins produces different phenotypes, thereby showing distinct roles of all CRMP family proteins. Also, the phenotypic analysis of a non-phosphorylated form of CRMP2-knockin mouse model, and studies of pharmacological responses to CRMP-related drugs suggest that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology in neuronal development, regeneration, and neurodegenerative disorders, thus showing CRMPs as promising target molecules for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors Stimulate Gβγ-GRK2-Mediated FAK Phosphorylation at Tyrosine 925 to Regulate ERK Activation Involving Neuronal Focal Adhesions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00176</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cannabinoid receptors (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are abundantly expressed in the nervous system where they regulate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). However, the role of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated FAK 925 tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) in regulating ERK1/2 activation remains undefined. Here, immunoblotting analyses using antibodies against FAK phospho-Tyr 925 and ERK2 phospho-Tyr 204 demonstrated CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated FAK 925 Tyr-P and ERK2 204 Tyr-P (0–5 min) which was followed by a decline in Tyr-P (5–20 min). CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; stimulated FAK-Grb2 association and Ras-mediated ERK2 activation. The FAK inhibitors Y11 and PF 573228 abolished FAK 925 Tyr-P and partially inhibited ERK2 204 Tyr-P. FAK 925 Tyr-P and ERK2 204 Tyr-P were adhesion-dependent, required an intact actin cytoskeleton, and were mediated by integrins, Flk-1 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and epidermal growth factor receptors. FAK 925 Tyr-P and ERK2 204 Tyr-P were blocked by the Gβγ inhibitor gallein, a GRK2 inhibitor, and GRK2 siRNA silencing, suggesting Gβγ and GRK2 participate in FAK-mediated ERK2 activation. Together, these studies indicate FAK 925 Tyr-P occurs concurrently with CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated ERK2 activation and requires the actin cytoskeleton and G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;βγ-GRK2-mediated cross-talk between CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, integrins, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inflammation-Associated Synaptic Alterations as Shared Threads in Depression and Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00169</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past years, several theories have been advanced to explain the pathogenesis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a neuropsychiatric disease that causes disability in general population. Several theories have been proposed to define the MDD pathophysiology such as the classic “monoamine-theory” or the “glutamate hypothesis.” All these theories have been recently integrated by evidence highlighting inflammation as a pivotal player in developing depressive symptoms. Proinflammatory cytokines have been indeed claimed to contribute to stress-induced mood disturbances and to major depression, indicating a widespread role of classical mediators of inflammation in emotional control. Moreover, during systemic inflammatory diseases, peripherally released cytokines circulate in the blood, reach the brain and cause anxiety, anhedonia, social withdrawal, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Accordingly, chronic inflammatory disorders, such as the inflammatory autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS), have been associated to higher risk of MDD, in comparison with overall population. Importantly, in both MS patients and in its experimental mouse model, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), the notion that depressive symptoms are reactive epiphenomenon to the MS pathology has been recently challenged by the evidence of their early manifestation, even before the onset of the disease. Furthermore, in association to such mood disturbance, inflammatory-dependent synaptic dysfunctions in several areas of MS/EAE brain have been observed independently of brain lesions and demyelination. This evidence suggests that a fine interplay between the immune and nervous systems can have a huge impact on several neurological functions, including depressive symptoms, in different pathological conditions. The aim of the present review is to shed light on common traits between MDD and MS, by looking at inflammatory-dependent synaptic alterations associated with depression in both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Functional Connectivity Between the Trigeminal Main Sensory Nucleus and the Trigeminal Motor Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00167</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00167</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study shows new evidence of functional connectivity between the trigeminal main sensory (NVsnpr) and motor (NVmt) nuclei in rats and mice. NVsnpr neurons projecting to NVmt are most highly concentrated in its dorsal half. Their electrical stimulation induced multiphasic excitatory synaptic responses in trigeminal MNs and evoked calcium responses mainly in the jaw-closing region of NVmt. Induction of rhythmic bursting in NVsnpr neurons by local applications of BAPTA also elicited rhythmic firing or clustering of postsynaptic potentials in trigeminal motoneurons, further emphasizing the functional relationship between these two nuclei in terms of rhythm transmission. Biocytin injections in both nuclei and calcium-imaging in one of the two nuclei during electrical stimulation of the other revealed a specific pattern of connectivity between the two nuclei, which organization seemed to critically depend on the dorsoventral location of the stimulation site within NVsnpr with the most dorsal areas of NVsnpr projecting to the dorsolateral region of NVmt and intermediate areas projecting to ventromedial NVmt. This study confirms and develops earlier experiments by exploring the physiological nature and functional topography of the connectivity between NVsnpr and NVmt that was demonstrated in the past with neuroanatomical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Involvement of Kallikrein-Related Peptidases in Nervous System Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00166</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a family of serine proteases that when dysregulated may contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the present review article, we describe what is known about their physiological and pathological roles with an emphasis on KLK6 and KLK8, two KLKs that are highly expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Altered expression and activity of KLK6 have been linked to brain physiology and the development of multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, altered levels of KLK6 in the brain and serum of people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease have been documented, pointing out to its function in amyloid metabolism and development of synucleinopathies. People who have structural genetic variants of KLK8 can suffer mental illnesses such as intellectual and learning disabilities, seizures, and autism. Increased expression of KLK8 has also been implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Also, we discuss the possible link that exists between KLKs activity and certain viral infections that can affect the nervous system. Although little is known about the exact mechanisms that mediate KLKs function and their participation in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders will open a new field to develop novel therapies to modulate their levels and/or activity and their harmful effects on the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Longitudinal Intravital Microscopy Reveals Axon Degeneration Concomitant With Inflammatory Cell Infiltration in an LPC Model of Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00165</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00165</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Demyelination and axon degeneration are major events in all neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Intoxication of oligodendrocytes with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is often used as a selective model of focal and reversible demyelination thought to have no incidence for neurons. To characterize the cascade of cellular events involved in LPC-induced demyelination, we have combined intravital coherent antistoke Raman scattering microscopy with intravital two-photon fluorescence microscopy in multicolor transgenic reporter mice. Moreover, taking advantage of a unique technique of spinal glass window implantation, we here provide the first longitudinal description of cell dynamics in the same volume of interest over weeks after insults. We have detected several patterns of axon–myelin interactions and classified them in early and advanced events. Unexpectedly, we have found that oligodendrocyte damages are followed by axon degeneration within 2 days after LPC incubation, and this degeneration is amplified after the recruitment of the peripheral proinflammatory cells at day 4. Beyond day 7, the recovery of axon number and myelin takes 3 more weeks postlesion and involves a new wave of anti-inflammatory innate immune cells at day 14. Therefore, recurrent imaging over several weeks suggests an important role of peripheral immune cells in regulating both the axonal and oligodendroglial fates and thereby the remyelination status. Better understanding the recruitment of peripheral immune cells during demyelinating events should help to improve diagnosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are characterized by a progressive loss of selective neuron subtypes in the central nervous system (CNS). Although various factors account for the initiation and development of these diseases, accumulating evidence shows that impaired mitochondrial function is a prominent and common mechanism. Mitochondria play a critical role in neurons and are involved in energy production, cellular metabolism regulation, intracellular calcium homeostasis, immune responses, and cell fate. Thus, cells in the CNS heavily rely on mitochondrial integrity. Many aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction are manifested in neurodegenerative diseases, including aberrant mitochondrial quality control (mitoQC), mitochondrial-driven inflammation, and bioenergetic defects. Herein, we briefly summarize the molecular basis of mitoQC, including mitochondrial proteostasis, biogenesis, dynamics, and organelle degradation. We also focus on the research, to date, regarding aberrant mitoQC and mitochondrial-driven inflammation in several common neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we outline novel therapeutic strategies that target aberrant mitoQC in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: IL-6 in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Signals Disease Activity in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00120</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Specific proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules could represent useful cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to predict the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS). The proinflammatory molecule interleukin (IL)-6 has been investigated in the pathophysiology of MS and has been associated in previous smaller studies to increased disability and disease activity. Here, we wanted to further address IL-6 as a possible CSF biomarker of MS by investigating its detectability in a large cohort of 534 MS patients and in 103 individuals with other non-inflammatory neurological diseases. In these newly diagnosed patients, we also explored correlations between IL-6 detectability, MS phenotypes, and disease characteristics. We found that IL-6 was more frequently detectable in the CSF of MS patients compared with their control counterparts as significant differences emerged between patients with Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), Relapsing–remitting (RR), and secondary progressive and primary progressive MS compared to non-inflammatory controls. IL-6 was equally present in the CSF of all MS phenotypes. In RR MS patients, IL-6 detectability was found to signal clinically and/or radiologically defined disease activity, among all other clinical characteristics. Our results add further evidence that CSF proinflammatory cytokines could be useful for the identification of those MS patients who are prone to increased disease activity. In particular, IL-6 could represent an interesting prognostic biomarker of MS, as also demonstrated in other diseases where CSF IL-6 was found to identify patients with worse disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common age-related vascular disease of the brain associated with slowly accumulating tissue damage. At present, total CSVD burden score is a commonly used method to evaluate the severity of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;To observe whether global and regional cerebral perfusion is related to total CSVD score and to explore global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in patients with different degrees of CSVD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We collected 130 subjects with different total burden score of CSVD (0 point: 33 subjects, 1 point: 39 subjects, 2 points: 24 subjects, 3 points: 24 subjects, 4 points: 10 subjects). Total CSVD burden score was evaluated by clinically routine sequences (T2WI, T2-FLAIR, T1WI, DWI, and SWAN sequence). Global and regional CBF were calculated and correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between total CSVD score and CBF of the whole brain and several brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The analysis results showed that there was a negative correlation between total CSVD burden score and global CBF (r = −0.33, p = 0.001). Total CSVD burden score also had moderately negative correlations with CBF of almost all the brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CSVD is a disease that affects the whole brain. With the increase of total CSVD burden score, the global and regional CBF decreased. The CSVD total burden score could be used to evaluate the overall condition of brain perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identification of the Potential Key Circular RNAs in Elderly Patients With Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the severe complications after surgery, inducing low life quality and high mortality, especially in elderly patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of POCD remains largely unknown, and the ideal biomarker for clinical diagnosis and prognosis is lacking. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), as a unique class of non-coding RNAs, were characterized by its stability and conservativeness, serving as novel biomarkers in various diseases. Nevertheless, the role of circRNAs in the occurrence of POCD remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;To investigate the differentially expressed circRNAs in the serum of POCD patients and its potential role in the development of POCD, we performed a circRNA microarray to screen the differentially expressed circRNAs in the serum samples from three patients of the POCD group and three paired patients of the non-POCD group. Subsequently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) was utilized to verify the microarray data with the serum samples from 10 paired patients. Cytoscape software was used to construct the circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network for circRNAs with different expression levels as well as the target genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed the biological functions of the differentially expressed circRNAs target genes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In total, we have analyzed 10,198 circRNAs through the microarray. Compared with the non-POCD patient group, there were 210 differentially expressed circRNAs with 133 upregulated and 77 downregulated in the POCD group (≥2-fold differential expression, P ≤ 0.05). The qRT-PCR confirmed 10 circRNAs with different expressed levels, and the results were consistent with the microarray findings. Among them, hsa_circRNA_001145, hsa_circRNA_101138, and hsa_circRNA_061570 had the highest magnitude of change. The GO analysis showed that the differentially expressed circRNAs were associated with the regulation of the developmental process, cell-to-cell adhesion, and nervous system development. The KEGG analysis showed that the target genes of circRNAs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway and RAS signaling pathway. According to the targetscan7.1 and mirdbV5 databases, the circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was constructed, and these results provided a vital landscape of circRNA expression profile in POCD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Our study provides an essential perspective for the differential expression of circRNAs in POCD patients. Further studies need to be performed to explore their potential therapeutic roles in the development of POCD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Asymmetry of White Matter Hyperintensity Burden Between Hemispheres Is Associated With Intracranial Atherosclerotic Plaque Enhancement Grade</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00163</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00163</link>
	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;The contribution of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) to the development of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to retrospectively assess the relationship between WMH burden and unilateral ICAS by combined examination of lumen stenosis, plaque enhancement, and cerebral perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and methods&lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study of 41 patients with symptomatic unilateral ICAS (mean age 57 ± 10 years; 26 males) was conducted. Detailed clinical data, including vascular risk factors, were obtained. WMH volume was derived from 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) and was assessed by using a validated semi-automated protocol. Lumen stenosis, plaque enhancement, and cerebral perfusion (assessed on time-to-peak parameter using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (TTP-ASPECTS) scale) were evaluated. The WMH volumes of peri-ventricular (PWMH) and deep (DWMH) white matter were calculated separately and compared between hemispheres. Associations between WMH volume (inter-hemispheric volume difference, ipsilateral and contralateral to the ICAS site separately), unilateral ICAS imaging metrics, and vascular risk factors were assessed by using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The DWMH volume ipsilateral to the ICAS site (ipsilateral DWMH volume) was significantly greater than that of the contralateral site (P &amp;lt; 0.001), while the PWMH volume difference between hemispheres did not reach statistical significance. The inter-hemispheric DWMH volume difference was significantly associated with a higher plaque enhancement grade (β = 0.436, P = 0.005) and inversely associated with cerebral hypoperfusion (lower TTP-ASPECTS) (β = −0.613, P &amp;lt; 0.001). In the between-subject multivariable regression analysis, while older age (β = 0.323, P = 0.025), hypoperfusion (β = −0.394, P = 0.007), and hypertension (β = 0.378, P = 0.011) were independently associated with ipsilateral DWMH volume, plaque enhancement did not show an association with ipsilateral DWMH volume. The association between ipsilateral DWMH volume and lumen stenosis approached statistical significance (β = 0.274, P = 0.084).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The DWMH was attributed to chronic hypoperfusion secondary to atherosclerotic stenosis. The association between the asymmetry of deep white matter lesions and plaque enhancement might suggest that increased deep white matter lesions are those ischemic lesions, which are more prone to the development of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>We review aspects of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The topics we cover are relevant to immunotherapy with plasma from recovered patients, monoclonal antibodies against the viral S-protein, and soluble forms of the receptor for the virus, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, an essential public health tool, will also be informed by an understanding of the antibody response in infected patients. Although virus-neutralizing antibodies are likely to protect, antibodies could potentially trigger immunopathogenic events in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients or enhance infection. An awareness of these possibilities may benefit clinicians and the developers of antibody-based therapies and vaccines.</description>

	<title>eLife: Lack of evidence for associative learning in pea plants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57614</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57614</link>
	<description>Gagliano et al. (Learning by association in plants, 2016) reported associative learning in pea plants. Associative learning has long been considered a behavior performed only by animals, making this claim particularly newsworthy and interesting. In the experiment, plants were trained in Y-shaped mazes for 3 days with fans and lights attached at the top of the maze. Training consisted of wind consistently preceding light from either the same or the opposite arm of the maze. When plant growth forced a decision between the two arms of the maze, fans alone were able to influence growth direction, whereas the growth direction of untrained plants was not affected by fans. However, a replication of their protocol failed to demonstrate the same result, calling for further verification and study before mainstream acceptance of this paradigm-shifting phenomenon. This replication attempt used a larger sample size and fully blinded analysis.</description>

	<description>A goal of cancer research is to reveal cell subsets linked to continuous clinical outcomes to generate new therapeutic and biomarker hypotheses. We introduce a machine learning algorithm, Risk Assessment Population IDentification (RAPID), that is unsupervised and automated, identifies phenotypically distinct cell populations, and determines whether these populations stratify patient survival. With a pilot mass cytometry dataset of 2 million cells from 28 glioblastomas, RAPID identified tumor cells whose abundance independently and continuously stratified patient survival. Statistical validation within the workflow included repeated runs of stochastic steps and cell subsampling. Biological validation used an orthogonal platform, immunohistochemistry, and a larger cohort of 73 glioblastoma patients to confirm the findings from the pilot cohort. RAPID was also validated to find known risk-stratifying cells and features using published data from blood cancer. Thus, RAPID provides an automated, unsupervised approach for finding statistically and biologically significant cells using cytometry data from patient samples.</description>

	<title>eLife: Moyamoya disease factor RNF213 is a giant E3 ligase with a dynein-like core and a distinct ubiquitin-transfer mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56185</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56185</link>
	<description>RNF213 is the major susceptibility factor for Moyamoya disease, a progressive cerebrovascular disorder that often leads to brain stroke in adults and children. Characterization of disease-associated mutations has been complicated by the enormous size of RNF213. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of mouse RNF213. The structure reveals the intricate fold of the 584 kDa protein, comprising an N-terminal stalk, a dynein-like core with six ATPase units, and a multidomain E3 module. Collaboration with UbcH7, a cysteine-reactive E2, points to an unexplored ubiquitin-transfer mechanism that proceeds in a RING-independent manner. Moreover, we show that pathologic MMD mutations cluster in the composite E3 domain, likely interfering with substrate ubiquitination. In conclusion, the structure of RNF213 uncovers a distinct type of an E3 enzyme, highlighting the growing mechanistic diversity in ubiquitination cascades. Our results also provide the molecular framework for investigating the emerging role of RNF213 in lipid metabolism, hypoxia, and angiogenesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Skd3 (human CLPB) is a potent mitochondrial protein disaggregase that is inactivated by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria-linked mutations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55279</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55279</link>
	<description>Cells have evolved specialized protein disaggregases to reverse toxic protein aggregation and restore protein functionality. In nonmetazoan eukaryotes, the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp78 resolubilizes and reactivates proteins in mitochondria. Curiously, metazoa lack Hsp78. Hence, whether metazoan mitochondria reactivate aggregated proteins is unknown. Here, we establish that a mitochondrial AAA+ protein, Skd3 (human &lt;i&gt;CLPB&lt;/i&gt;), couples ATP hydrolysis to protein disaggregation and reactivation. The Skd3 ankyrin-repeat domain combines with conserved AAA+ elements to enable stand-alone disaggregase activity. A mitochondrial inner-membrane protease, PARL, removes an autoinhibitory peptide from Skd3 to greatly enhance disaggregase activity. Indeed, PARL-activated Skd3 dissolves α-synuclein fibrils connected to Parkinson's disease. Human cells lacking Skd3 exhibit reduced solubility of various mitochondrial proteins, including anti-apoptotic Hax1. Importantly, Skd3 variants linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a severe mitochondrial disorder, display diminished disaggregase activity (but not always reduced ATPase activity), which predicts disease severity. Thus, Skd3 is a potent protein disaggregase critical for human health.</description>

	<description>The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Re-cent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.</description>

	<title>eLife: A new genetic strategy for targeting microglia in development and disease</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54590</link>
	<description>As the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, microglia are crucial for the phagocytosis of infectious agents, apoptotic cells and synapses. During brain injury or infection, bone-marrow derived macrophages invade neural tissue, making it difficult to distinguish between invading macrophages and resident microglia. In addition to circulation-derived monocytes, other non-microglial central nervous system (CNS) macrophage subtypes include border-associated meningeal, perivascular and choroid plexus macrophages. Using immunofluorescent labeling, flow cytometry and Cre-dependent ribosomal immunoprecipitations, we describe &lt;i&gt;P2ry12-CreER&lt;/i&gt;, a new tool for the genetic targeting of microglia. We use this new tool to track microglia during embryonic development and in the context of ischemic injury and neuro-inflammation. Because of the specificity and robustness of microglial recombination with &lt;i&gt;P2ry12-CreER&lt;/i&gt;, we believe that this new mouse line will be particularly useful for future studies of microglial function in development and disease.</description>

	<title>eLife: Tuning of feedforward control enables stable muscle force-length dynamics after loss of autogenic proprioceptive feedback</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53908</link>
	<description>Animals must integrate feedforward, feedback and intrinsic mechanical control mechanisms to maintain stable locomotion. Recent studies of guinea fowl (&lt;i&gt;Numida meleagris&lt;/i&gt;) revealed that the distal leg muscles rapidly modulate force and work output to minimize perturbations in uneven terrain. Here we probe the role of reflexes in the rapid perturbation responses of muscle by studying the effects of proprioceptive loss. We induced bilateral loss of autogenic proprioception in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle (LG) using self-reinnervation. We compared &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; muscle dynamics and ankle kinematics in birds with reinnervated and intact LG. Reinnervated and intact LG exhibit similar steady state mechanical function and similar work modulation in response to obstacle encounters. Reinnervated LG exhibits 23ms earlier steady-state activation, consistent with feedforward tuning of activation phase to compensate for lost proprioception. Modulation of activity duration is impaired in rLG, confirming the role of reflex feedback in regulating force duration in intact muscle.</description>

	<title>eLife: The E2 Marie Kondo and the CTLH E3 ligase clear deposited RNA binding proteins during the maternal-to-zygotic transition</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53889</link>
	<description>The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a conserved step in animal development, where control is passed from the maternal to the zygotic genome. Although the MZT is typically considered from its impact on the transcriptome, we previously found that three maternally deposited &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; RNA binding proteins (ME31B, Trailer Hitch [TRAL], and Cup) are also cleared during the MZT by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Marie Kondo, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and the E3 CTLH ligase are required for the destruction of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup. Structure modeling of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; CTLH complex suggests that substrate recognition is different than orthologous complexes. Despite occurring hours earlier, egg activation mediates clearance of these proteins through the Pan Gu kinase, which stimulates translation of &lt;i&gt;Kondo&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Clearance of the maternal protein dowry thus appears to be a coordinated, but as-yet underappreciated, aspect of the MZT.</description>

	<description>Glucose utilization increases in tumors, a metabolic process that is observed clinically by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG-PET). However, is increased glucose uptake important for tumor cells, and which transporters are implicated in vivo? In a genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we show that the deletion of only one highly expressed glucose transporter, Glut1 or Glut3, in cancer cells does not impair tumor growth, whereas their combined loss diminishes tumor development. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG-PET analyses of tumors demonstrate that Glut1 and Glut3 loss decreases glucose uptake, which is mainly dependent on Glut1. Using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-glucose tracing with correlated nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and electron microscopy, we also report the presence of lamellar body-like organelles in tumor cells accumulating glucose-derived biomass, depending partially on Glut1. Our results demonstrate the requirement for two glucose transporters in lung adenocarcinoma, the dual blockade of which could reach therapeutic responses not achieved by individual targeting.</description>

	<title>eLife: Sequentially induced motor neurons from human fibroblasts facilitate locomotor recovery in a rodent spinal cord injury model</title>

	<description>Generation of autologous human motor neurons holds great promise for cell replacement therapy to treat spinal cord injury (SCI). Direct conversion allows generation of target cells from somatic cells, however, current protocols are not practicable for therapeutic purposes since converted cells are post-mitotic that are not scalable. Therefore, therapeutic effects of directly converted neurons have not been elucidated yet. Here, we show that human fibroblasts can be converted into induced motor neurons (iMNs) by sequentially inducing &lt;i&gt;POU5F1(OCT4)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LHX3&lt;/i&gt;. Our strategy enables scalable production of pure iMNs because of the transient acquisition of proliferative iMN-intermediate cell stage which is distinct from neural progenitors. iMNs exhibited hallmarks of spinal motor neurons including transcriptional profiles, electrophysiological property, synaptic activity, and neuromuscular junction formation. Remarkably, transplantation of iMNs showed therapeutic effects, promoting locomotor functional recovery in rodent SCI model. Together, our advanced strategy will provide tools to acquire sufficient human iMNs that may represent a promising cell source for personalized cell therapy.</description>

	<description>Recent studies provided strong evidence that deficits in cholinergic signaling cause disorders of cognition and affect conscious processing. Technical advances that combine molecular approaches, in vivo recordings in awake behaving animals, human brain imaging, and genetics have strengthened our understanding of the roles of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the modulation of cognitive behavior and network dynamics. Here, we review the emergent role of nAChRs in high-order cognitive processes and discuss recent work implicating cholinergic circuits in cognitive control, including conscious processing.</description>

	<description>Cai et al. report that MORRBID/Morrbid expression is aberrantly increased in human AML patients and mouse models for CMML, MPN, and AML. Genetic loss of Morrbid makes leukemic cells vulnerable to apoptosis and mitigates the progression of myeloid neoplasms. High expression of MORRBID in humans is associated with poor survival of AML patients.</description>

	<description>Modeling diseases in non-human species is complicated as many enhancers that regulate expression are species specific. Castelijns et al. demonstrate that species-specific enhancers are highly variable and poorly integrated in the regulatory network, suggesting their biological impact is low. Instead, disease-associated enhancers are typically conserved and can therefore be modeled.</description>

	<description>Clustering of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses is crucial for synaptic inhibition. Rajgor et al. discover that synaptic GABAAR expression is controlled by their local translation, regulated by miR376c. During inhibitory synaptic potentiation, miR376c is downregulated, relieving its translational repression of GABAAR mRNAs and leading to de novo synthesis of dendritic GABAARs.</description>

	<description>Cheng et al. demonstrate that medulloblastoma cells retain the capacity to undergo differentiation. The differentiation of tumor cells is regulated by NeuroD1 expression, which is repressed by H3K27me3 in tumor cells. EZH2 inhibitors suppress medulloblastoma growth by stimulating tumor cell differentiation.</description>

	<description>Di Nardo et al. find that cortical tubers from TSC patients and mutant mouse brains have fewer cilia. An image-based screening of mTORC1 activity in TSC1/2-deficient neurons leads to the identification of the heat-shock machinery as a druggable signaling node to restore mTORC1 activity and cilia.</description>

	<description>Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) regulates the synthesis of monoaminergic neurotransmitters and is linked to psychiatric and metabolic disorders. Ddc exhibits complex genomic imprinting effects that have not been functionally studied. Here, we investigate different noncanonical imprinting effects at the cellular level with a focus on Ddc. Using allele-specific reporter mice, we found Ddc exhibits dominant expression of the maternal allele in subpopulations of cells in 14 of 52 brain regions, and dominant paternal or maternal allele expression in adrenal cell subpopulations. Maternal versus paternal Ddc allele null mutations differentially affect offspring social, foraging and exploratory behaviors. Machine learning analyses of naturalistic foraging in Ddc-/+ and +/- offspring uncovered finite behavioral sequences controlled by the maternal versus paternal Ddc alleles. Additionally, parental Ddc genotype is revealed to affect behavior independent of offspring genotype. Thus, Ddc is a hub of maternal and paternal influence on behavior that mediates diverse imprinting and parental effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Locomotor deficits in ALS mice are paralleled by loss of V1-interneuron-connections onto fast motor neurons</title>

	<description>ALS is characterized by progressive inability to execute movements. Motor neurons innervating fast-twitch muscle fibers exhibit preferential degeneration. The reason for differential vulnerability of fast motor neurons, and its consequence on motor output is not known. Here, we show that fast motor neurons receive more inhibitory synaptic inputs than slow motor neurons, and loss of inhibitory synapses onto fast motor neurons precedes disease progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. Loss of inhibitory synapses on fast motor neurons is accounted for by a loss of synapses from inhibitory V1 spinal interneurons. Deficits in V1-motor neuron connectivity appear prior to motor neuron death and are paralleled by development of specific SOD1G93A locomotor deficits. These distinct SOD1G93A locomotor deficits are phenocopied by silencing of inhibitory V1 spinal interneurons in wild-type mice. Silencing inhibitory V1 spinal interneurons does not exacerbate SOD1G93A locomotor deficits, suggesting phenotypic pathway interaction. Our study identifies a potential cell non-autonomous source of motor neuronal vulnerability in ALS, and links ALS-induced changes in locomotor phenotypes to inhibitory V1 interneurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: TIR-1/SARM1 Inhibits Axon Regeneration</title>

	<description>An injured axon has two choices, regenerate or degenerate. In many neurons, the result is catastrophic axon degeneration and a failure to regenerate. To coerce the injured nervous system to regenerate, the molecular mechanisms that regulate both axon regeneration and degeneration need to be defined. We found that TIR-1/SARM1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, inhibits regeneration of injured motor axons. Loss of tir-1 function both reduces the frequency with which severed axon fragments degenerate and increases the frequency of axon regeneration. The increased regeneration in tir-1 mutants is not a secondary consequence of its effects on degeneration. Rather, TIR-1 carries out each of these opposing functions cell autonomously by regulating independent downstream genetic pathways. While promoting axon degeneration with the DLK-1 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, TIR-1 inhibits axon regeneration by activating the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPK signaling cascade. Our finding that TIR-1 regulates both axon regeneration and degeneration provides critical insight into how axons coordinately regulate the two key responses to injury, consequently informing approaches to manipulate the balance between these responses towards repair.</description>

Post-translational modification (PTM) sites have become popular for predictor development. However, with the exception of phosphorylation and a handful of other examples, PTMs suffer from a limited number of available training examples and sparsity in protein sequences. Here, proline hydroxylation is taken as an example to compare different methods and evaluate their performance on new experimentally determined sites. As a guide for effective experimental design, predictors require both high specificity and sensitivity. However, the self-reported performance may often not be indicative of prediction quality and detection of new sites is not guaranteed. We have benchmarked seven published hydroxylation site predictors on two newly constructed independent datasets. The self-reported performance is found to widely overestimate the real accuracy measured on independent datasets. No predictor performs better than random on new examples, indicating the refined models do not sufficiently generalize to detect new sites. The number of false positives is high and precision low, in particular for non-collagen proteins whose motifs are not conserved. As hydroxylation site predictors do not generalize for new data, caution is advised when using PTM predictors in the absence of independent evaluations, in particular for highly specific sites involved in signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xIIeNE3RgP0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Contemporary reinforcement learning (RL) theory suggests that potential choices can be evaluated by strategies that may or may not be sensitive to the computational structure of tasks. A paradigmatic model-free (MF) strategy simply repeats actions that have been rewarded in the past; by contrast, model-sensitive (MS) strategies exploit richer information associated with knowledge of task dynamics. MF and MS strategies should typically be combined, because they have complementary statistical and computational strengths; however, this tradeoff between MF/MS RL has mostly only been demonstrated in humans, often with only modest numbers of trials. We trained rhesus monkeys to perform a two-stage decision task designed to elicit and discriminate the use of MF and MS methods. A descriptive analysis of choice behaviour revealed directly that the structure of the task (of MS importance) and the reward history (of MF and MS importance) significantly influenced both choice and response vigour. A detailed, trial-by-trial computational analysis confirmed that choices were made according to a combination of strategies, with a dominant influence of a particular form of model sensitivity that persisted over weeks of testing. The residuals from this model necessitated development of a new combined RL model which incorporates a particular credit assignment weighting procedure. Finally, response vigor exhibited a subtly different collection of MF and MS influences. These results provide new illumination onto RL behavioural processes in non-human primates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HS__dLvZ-Mw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Multiscale modeling of human cerebrovasculature: A hybrid approach using image-based geometry and a mathematical algorithm</title>

The cerebral vasculature has a complex and hierarchical network, ranging from vessels of a few millimeters to superficial cortical vessels with diameters of a few hundred micrometers, and to the microvasculature (arteriole/venule) and capillary beds in the cortex. In standard imaging techniques, it is difficult to segment all vessels in the network, especially in the case of the human brain. This study proposes a hybrid modeling approach that determines these networks by explicitly segmenting the large vessels from medical images and employing a novel vascular generation algorithm. The framework enables vasculatures to be generated at coarse and fine scales for individual arteries and veins with vascular subregions, following the personalized anatomy of the brain and macroscale vasculatures. In this study, the vascular structures of superficial cortical (pial) vessels before they penetrate the cortex are modeled as a mesoscale vasculature. The validity of the present approach is demonstrated through comparisons with partially observed data from existing measurements of the vessel distributions on the brain surface, pathway fractal features, and vascular territories of the major cerebral arteries. Additionally, this validation provides some biological insights: (i) vascular pathways may form to ensure a reasonable supply of blood to the local surface area; (ii) fractal features of vascular pathways are not sensitive to overall and local brain geometries; and (iii) whole pathways connecting the upstream and downstream entire-scale cerebral circulation are highly dependent on the local curvature of the cerebral sulci.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EfM0TEKsLq4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Classifying sex and strain from mouse ultrasonic vocalizations using deep learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007918</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by A. Ivanenko, P. Watkins, M. A. J. van Gerven, K. Hammerschmidt, B. Englitz&lt;/p&gt;

Vocalizations are widely used for communication between animals. Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts. During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information. Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs and using 24 extracted features per USV, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features. The same network architecture was also able to achieve above-chance classification for cortexless mice, which were considered indistinguishable before. In summary, spectrotemporal differences between male and female USVs allow at least their partial classification, which enables sexual recognition between mice and automated attribution of USVs during analysis of social interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DSBqzv-Xors&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Inflammation and infection can trigger local tissue Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation. This Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-rich environment boosts proinflammatory activation of monocyte/macrophage-like cells (MΦs) and their antimicrobial activity. Enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven MΦ function requires the osmoprotective transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), which augments nitric oxide (NO) production and contributes to increased autophagy. However, the mechanism of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sensing in MΦs remained unclear. High extracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels (high salt [HS]) trigger a substantial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; loss. Here, we show that the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger 1 (NCX1, also known as solute carrier family 8 member A1 [SLC8A1]) plays a critical role in HS-triggered Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, concomitant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, and subsequent augmented NFAT5 accumulation. Moreover, interfering with NCX1 activity impairs HS-boosted inflammatory signaling, infection-triggered autolysosome formation, and subsequent antibacterial activity. Taken together, this demonstrates that NCX1 is able to sense Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and is required for amplifying inflammatory and antimicrobial MΦ responses upon HS exposure. Manipulating NCX1 offers a new strategy to regulate MΦ function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ksxyTGdBMK8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: TRPV4 Antagonism Prevents Mechanically Induced Myotonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25780?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25780?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myotonia is caused by involuntary firing of skeletal muscle action potentials and causes debilitating stiffness. Current treatments are insufficiently efficacious and associated with side effects. Myotonia can be triggered by voluntary movement (electrically induced myotonia) or percussion (mechanically induced myotonia). Whether distinct molecular mechanisms underlie these triggers is unknown. Our goal was to identify ion channels involved in mechanically induced myotonia and to evaluate block of the channels involved as a novel approach to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel system to enable study of mechanically induced myotonia using both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of myotonia congenita. We extended ex vivo studies of excitability to in vivo studies of muscle stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previous work suggests activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels by mechanical stimuli in muscle, we examined the role of this cation channel. Mechanically induced myotonia was markedly suppressed in TRPV4‐null muscles and in muscles treated with TRPV4 small molecule antagonists. The suppression of mechanically induced myotonia occurred without altering intrinsic muscle excitability, such that myotonia triggered by firing of action potentials (electrically induced myotonia) was unaffected. When injected intraperitoneally, TRPV4 antagonists lessened the severity of myotonia in vivo by approximately 80%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that there are distinct molecular mechanisms triggering electrically induced and mechanically induced myotonia. Our data indicates that activation of TRPV4 during muscle contraction plays an important role in triggering myotonia in vivo. Elimination of mechanically induced myotonia by TRPV4 inhibition offers a new approach to treating myotonia. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Development and validation of forecasting next reported seizure using e‐diaries</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25812?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no validated methods for predicting the timing of seizures. Using machine learning, we sought to forecast 24‐hour risk of self‐reported seizure from e‐diaries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 5,419 patients of &lt;a href=&quot;http://seizuretracker.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;SeizureTracker.com&lt;/a&gt; (including seizure count, type and duration) was split into training (3,806 patients/1,665,215 patient‐days) and testing (1,613 patients/549,588 patient‐days) sets with no overlapping patients. An artificial intelligence (AI) program, consisting recurrent networks followed by a multilayer perceptron (“deep learning” model) was trained to produce risk forecasts. Forecasts were made from a sliding window of 3‐month diary history for each day of each patient's diary. After training, the model parameters were held constant and the testing set was scored. A rate‐matched random (RMR) forecast was compared to the AI. Comparisons were made using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a measure of binary discrimination performance, and the Brier Score, a measure of forecast calibration. The Brier Skill Score (BSS) measured the improvement of the AI Brier Score compared to the benchmark RMR Brier score. Confidence intervals on performance statistics were obtained via bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AUC was 0.86 (0.85‐0.88) for AI and 0.83 (0.81‐0.85) for RMR, favoring AI (p&amp;lt;0.001). Overall (all patients combined) BSS was 0.27(0.23‐0.31), also favoring AI (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI produced a valid forecast superior to a chance forecaster, and provided meaningful forecasts in the majority of patients. Future studies will be needed to quantify the clinical value of these forecasts for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eLife: Evidence for transmission of COVID-19 prior to symptom onset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57149</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57149</link>
	<description>We collated contact tracing data from COVID-19 clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China and estimated the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission by estimating incubation periods and serial intervals. The mean incubation periods accounting for intermediate cases were 4.91 days (95%CI 4.35, 5.69) and 7.54 (95%CI 6.76, 8.56) days for Singapore and Tianjin, respectively. The mean serial interval was 4.17 (95%CI 2.44, 5.89) and 4.31 (95%CI 2.91, 5.72) days (Singapore, Tianjin). The serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission may occur in a large proportion of transmission events (0.4-0.5 in Singapore and 0.6-0.8 in Tianjin, in our analysis with intermediate cases, and more without intermediates). Given the evidence for pre-symptomatic transmission it is vital that even individuals who appear healthy abide by public health measures to control COVID-19.</description>

	<title>eLife: The caudate nucleus contributes causally to decisions that balance reward and uncertain visual information</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56694</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56694</link>
	<description>Our decisions often balance what we observe and what we desire. A prime candidate for implementing this complex balancing act is the basal ganglia pathway, but its roles have not yet been examined experimentally in detail. Here, we show that a major input station of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus, plays a causal role in integrating uncertain visual evidence and reward context to guide adaptive decision-making. In monkeys making saccadic decisions based on motion cues and asymmetric reward-choice associations, single caudate neurons encoded both sources of information. Electrical microstimulation at caudate sites during motion viewing affected the monkeys’ decisions. These microstimulation effects included coordinated changes in multiple computational components of the decision process that mimicked the monkeys’ similarly coordinated voluntary strategies for balancing visual and reward information. These results imply that the caudate nucleus plays causal roles in coordinating decision processes that balance external evidence and internal preferences.</description>

	<title>eLife: A divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls the atypical replication of a malaria parasite during gametogony and transmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56474</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56474</link>
	<description>Cell cycle transitions are generally triggered by variation in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei&lt;/i&gt; CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation. Our results provide evidence that during &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; male gametogony, this divergent cyclin/CDK pair fills the functional space of other eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling DNA replication.</description>

	<title>eLife: The Wg and Dpp morphogens regulate gene expression by modulating the frequency of transcriptional bursts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56076</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56076</link>
	<description>Morphogen signaling contributes to the patterned spatiotemporal expression of genes during development. One mode of regulation of signaling-responsive genes is at the level of transcription. Single-cell quantitative studies of transcription have revealed that transcription occurs intermittently, in bursts. Although the effects of many gene regulatory mechanisms on transcriptional bursting have been studied, it remains unclear how morphogen gradients affect this dynamic property of downstream genes. Here we have adapted single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) for use in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing imaginal disc in order to measure nascent and mature mRNA of genes downstream of the Wg and Dpp morphogen gradients. We compared our experimental results with predictions from stochastic models of transcription, which indicated that the transcription levels of these genes appear to share a common method of control via burst frequency modulation. Our data helps further elucidate the link between developmental gene regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional bursting.</description>

	<title>eLife: A single-cell transcriptomic and anatomic atlas of mouse dorsal raphe Pet1 neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55523</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55523</link>
	<description>Among the brainstem raphe nuclei, the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) contains the greatest number of &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt;-lineage neurons, a predominantly serotonergic group distributed throughout DR subdomains. These neurons collectively regulate diverse physiology and behavior and are often therapeutically targeted to treat affective disorders. Characterizing &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neuron molecular heterogeneity and relating it to anatomy is vital for understanding DR functional organization, with potential to inform therapeutic separability. Here we use high-throughput and DR subdomain-targeted single-cell transcriptomics and intersectional genetic tools to map molecular and anatomical diversity of DR-&lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons. We describe up to fourteen neuron subtypes, many showing biased cell body distributions across the DR. We further show that &lt;i&gt;P2ry1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; DR neurons – the most molecularly distinct subtype – possess unique efferent projections and electrophysiological properties. These data complement and extend previous DR characterizations, combining intersectional genetics with multiple transcriptomic modalities to achieve fine-scale molecular and anatomic identification of &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neuron subtypes.</description>

	<title>eLife: Local frustration determines loop opening during the catalytic cycle of an oxidoreductase</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54661</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54661</link>
	<description>Local structural frustration, the existence of mutually exclusive competing interactions, may explain why some proteins are dynamic while others are rigid. Frustration is thought to underpin biomolecular recognition and the flexibility of protein binding sites. Here we show how a small chemical modification, the oxidation of two cysteine thiols to a disulfide bond, during the catalytic cycle of the N-terminal domain of the key bacterial oxidoreductase DsbD (nDsbD), introduces frustration ultimately influencing protein function. In oxidized nDsbD, local frustration disrupts the packing of the protective cap-loop region against the active site allowing loop opening. By contrast, in reduced nDsbD the cap loop is rigid, always protecting the active-site thiols from the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. Our results point towards an intricate coupling between the dynamics of the active-site cysteines and of the cap loop which modulates the association reactions of nDsbD with its partners resulting in optimized protein function.</description>

	<description>Recent studies have demonstrated prominent and widespread movement-related signals in the brain of head-fixed mice, even in primary sensory areas. However, it is still unknown what role these signals play in sensory processing. Why are these sensory areas ‘contaminated’ by movement signals? During natural behavior, animals actively acquire sensory information as they move through the environment and use this information to guide ongoing actions. In this context, movement-related signals could allow sensory systems to predict self-induced sensory changes and extract additional information about the environment.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Haploinsufficiency of Cyfip2 Causes Lithium‐Responsive Prefrontal Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25827?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25827?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants of the cytoplasmic FMR1‐interacting protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;CYFIP2 &lt;/i&gt;) encoding an actin‐regulatory protein are associated with brain disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy. However, specific &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; neuronal defects and potential treatments for &lt;i&gt;CYFIP2 &lt;/i&gt;‐associated brain disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt; heterozygous (&lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;) mice to understand their neurobehavioral phenotypes and underlying pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, we examined a potential treatment for such phenotypes of the &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice and specified a neuronal function mediating its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed behavioral analyses on &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We combined molecular, ultrastructural, and &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological analyses on &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; prefrontal neurons. We also selectively reduced CYFIP2 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice with viral injections.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited lithium‐responsive abnormal behaviors. We found increased filamentous actin, enlarged dendritic spines, and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability in the adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; PFC that was restricted to layer 5 (L5) neurons. Consistently, adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed increased seizure susceptibility and auditory steady‐state responses from the cortical electroencephalographic recordings. Among the identified prefrontal defects, lithium selectively normalized the hyperexcitability of &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; L5 neurons. RNA‐sequencing revealed reduced expression of potassium channel genes in the adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; PFC. Viral‐mediated CYFIP2 reduction in the PFC was sufficient to induce L5 hyperexcitability and lithium‐responsive abnormal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that L5‐specific prefrontal dysfunction, especially hyperexcitability, underlies both the pathophysiology and lithium‐mediated amelioration of neurobehavioral phenotypes in adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/− &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice, which can be implicated in &lt;i&gt;CYFIP2 &lt;/i&gt;‐associated brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Moving analytical ultracentrifugation software to a good manufacturing practices (GMP) environment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007942</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexey Savelyev, Gary E. Gorbet, Amy Henrickson, Borries Demeler&lt;/p&gt;

Recent advances in instrumentation have moved analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) closer to a possible validation in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) environment. In order for AUC to be validated for a GMP environment, stringent requirements need to be satisfied; analysis procedures must be evaluated for consistency and reproducibility, and GMP capable data acquisition software needs to be developed and validated. These requirements extend to multiple regulatory aspects, covering documentation of instrument hardware functionality, data handling and software for data acquisition and data analysis, process control, audit trails and automation. Here we review the requirements for GMP validation of data acquisition software and illustrate software solutions based on UltraScan that address these requirements as far as they relate to the operation and data handling in conjunction with the latest analytical ultracentrifuge, the Optima AUC by Beckman Coulter. The software targets the needs of regulatory agencies, where AUC plays a critical role in the solutionbased characterization of biopolymers and macromolecular assemblies. Biopharmaceutical and regulatory agencies rely heavily on this technique for characterizations of pharmaceutical formulations, biosimilars, injectables, nanoparticles, and other soluble therapeutics. Because of its resolving power, AUC is a favorite application, despite the current lack of GMP validation. We believe that recent advances in standards, hardware, and software presented in this work manage to bridge this gap and allow AUC to be routinely used in a GMP environment. AUC has great potential to provide more detailed information, at higher resolution, and with greater confidence than other analytical techniques, and our software satisfies an urgent need for AUC operation in the GMP environment. The software, including documentation, are publicly available for free download from Github. The multi-platform software is licensed by the LGPL v.3 open source license and supports Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. Installation instructions and a mailing list are available from ultrascan.aucsolutions.com.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qH8I92puJMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A high quality benchmark for small variants encompassing 88 to 90% of the reference genome has been developed for seven Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference samples. However a reliable benchmark for large indels and structural variants (SVs) is more challenging. In this study, we manually curated 1235 SVs, which can ultimately be used to evaluate SV callers or train machine learning models. We developed a crowdsourcing app—SVCurator—to help GIAB curators manually review large indels and SVs within the human genome, and report their genotype and size accuracy. SVCurator displays images from short, long, and linked read sequencing data from the GIAB Ashkenazi Jewish Trio son [NIST RM 8391/HG002]. We asked curators to assign labels describing SV type (deletion or insertion), size accuracy, and genotype for 1235 putative insertions and deletions sampled from different size bins between 20 and 892,149 bp. ‘Expert’ curators were 93% concordant with each other, and 37 of the 61 curators had at least 78% concordance with a set of ‘expert’ curators. The curators were least concordant for complex SVs and SVs that had inaccurate breakpoints or size predictions. After filtering events with low concordance among curators, we produced high confidence labels for 935 events. The SVCurator crowdsourced labels were 94.5% concordant with the heuristic-based draft benchmark SV callset from GIAB. We found that curators can successfully evaluate putative SVs when given evidence from multiple sequencing technologies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yYwFuZlsBC4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The auditory neural code is resilient to acoustic variability and capable of recognizing sounds amongst competing sound sources, yet, the transformations enabling noise robust abilities are largely unknown. We report that a hierarchical spiking neural network (HSNN) optimized to maximize word recognition accuracy in noise and multiple talkers predicts organizational hierarchy of the ascending auditory pathway. Comparisons with data from auditory nerve, midbrain, thalamus and cortex reveals that the optimal HSSN predicts several transformations of the ascending auditory pathway including a sequential loss of temporal resolution and synchronization ability, increasing sparseness, and selectivity. The optimal organizational scheme enhances performance by selectively filtering out noise and fast temporal cues such as voicing periodicity, that are not directly relevant to the word recognition task. An identical network arranged to enable high information transfer fails to predict auditory pathway organization and has substantially poorer performance. Furthermore, conventional single-layer linear and nonlinear receptive field networks that capture the overall feature extraction of the HSNN fail to achieve similar performance. The findings suggest that the auditory pathway hierarchy and its sequential nonlinear feature extraction computations enhance relevant cues while removing non-informative sources of noise, thus enhancing the representation of sounds in noise impoverished conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DD252m6Ocbo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Cryo-EM structure of the nonameric CsgG-CsgF complex and its implications for controlling curli biogenesis in Enterobacteriaceae</title>

Curli play critical roles in biofilm formation, host cell adhesion, and colonization of inert surfaces in many Enterobacteriaceae. In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, curli biogenesis requires 7 curli-specific gene (&lt;i&gt;csg&lt;/i&gt;) products—CsgA through G—working in concert. Of them, CsgG and CsgF are 2 outer membrane (OM)-localized components that consists of the core apparatus for secretion and assembly of curli structural subunits, CsgB and CsgA. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of CsgG in complex with CsgF from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. The structure reveals that CsgF forms a stable complex with CsgG via a 1:1 stoichiometry by lining the upper lumen of the nonameric CsgG channel via its N-terminal 27 residues, forming a funnel-like entity plugged in the CsgG channel and creating a unique secretion channel with 2 constriction regions, consistent with the recently reported structure of the CsgG-CsgF complex. Functional studies indicate that export of CsgF to the cell surface requires the CsgG channel, and CsgF not only functions as an adaptor that bridges CsgB with CsgG but also may play important roles in controlling the rates of translocation and/or polymerization for curli structural subunits. Importantly, we found that a series of CsgF-derived peptides are able to efficiently inhibit curli production to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; when administrated exogenously, highlighting a potential strategy to interfere biofilm formation in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RmDTSjyQvcY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dopamine modulates subcortical responses to surprising sounds</title>

Dopamine guides behavior and learning through pleasure, according to classic understanding. Dopaminergic neurons are traditionally thought to signal positive or negative prediction errors (PEs) when reward expectations are, respectively, exceeded or not matched. These signed PEs are quite different from the unsigned PEs, which report surprise during sensory processing. But mounting theoretical accounts from the predictive processing framework postulate that dopamine, as a neuromodulator, could potentially regulate the postsynaptic gain of sensory neurons, thereby scaling unsigned PEs according to their expected precision or confidence. Despite ample modeling work, the physiological effects of dopamine on the processing of surprising sensory information are yet to be addressed experimentally. In this study, we tested how dopamine modulates midbrain processing of unexpected tones. We recorded extracellular responses from the rat inferior colliculus to oddball and cascade sequences, before, during, and after the microiontophoretic application of dopamine or eticlopride (a D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor antagonist). Results demonstrate that dopamine reduces the net neuronal responsiveness exclusively to unexpected sensory input without significantly altering the processing of expected input. We conclude that dopaminergic projections from the thalamic subparafascicular nucleus to the inferior colliculus could encode the expected precision of unsigned PEs, attenuating via D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptors the postsynaptic gain of sensory inputs forwarded by the auditory midbrain neurons. This direct dopaminergic modulation of sensory PE signaling has profound implications for both the predictive coding framework and the understanding of dopamine function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JHDPF6zB2SM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: HSPGs glypican‐1 and glypican‐4 are human neuronal proteins characteristic of different neural phenotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;HSPGs glypican‐1 and glypican‐4 are human neuronal proteins characteristic of different neural phenotypes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/888e0a08-e0cf-4e0e-a9ba-fcfe803a1061/jnr24666-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) have previously been reported as markers of lineage‐specific neural stem cells. Here, their pheonotypical characteristics were further examined under neuronal differentiation conditions in the presence of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). GPC1 and GPC4 demonstrated differential localized expression during long‐term (40–60 days) neuronal differentiation, suggesting different functions within neural cells. Under BDNF conditions, higher GPC4 to GPC1 gene expression ratio correlated with increased heterogeneity, increased proliferation, and increased GABAergic marker expression. In contrast, PDGF conditions resulted in higher GPC1 to GPC4 gene expression ratio and resulting in decreased heterogeneity, increased spontaneous activity, and increased dopaminergic marker expression. Our results confirm GPC1 and GPC4 as human neural proteins providing a potential set of novel markers to characterize different neural cell populations in terms of maturity, heterogeneity, and subtype differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating neurons from human stem cells has potential for brain damage therapy and neurogenesis modeling, but current efficacy is limited by culture heterogeneity and the lack of markers. We have previously reported the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) as the markers of lineage‐specific human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and mediators of hNSC lineage potential. Here, we further examined phenotypical characteristics and GPC1 and GPC4 during neural differentiation of hNSCs in the presence of two neurogenic growth factors reported to bind to heparan sulfate: brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). In hNSC neural cultures, GPC1 and GPC4 were expressed along neurites and cell bodies in long‐term (40–60 days) neural differentiation cultures demonstrating the areas of differential localization—suggesting potentially different functions. Neural differentiation cultures in the presence of BDNF or PDGF‐B generated phenotypically different neural cells with BDNF treatment associated with higher &lt;i&gt;GPC4 &lt;/i&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;GPC1 &lt;/i&gt; expression, increased heterogeneity, and differential neuron subtype marker expression to PDGF‐B cultures. PDGF‐B cultures exhibited higher levels of spontaneous activity and reduced heterogeneity over long‐term culture associated with decreased &lt;i&gt;GPC4 &lt;/i&gt;. Untreated neural cultures were highly variable, supporting the use of neuroregulatory growth factors for guided differentiation. Targeted siRNA downregulation of GPC1/4 reduced neural differentiation markers and altered response to exogenous BDNF and PDGF‐B. This work confirms GPC1 and GPC4 as regulators of human neural differentiation and supports their use as novel markers of neural cell characterization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phase synchronization measures are widely used for investigating inter-regional functional connectivity (FC) of brain oscillations, but which phase synchronization measure should be chosen for a given experiment remains unclear. Using neuromagnetic brain signals recorded from healthy participants during somatosensory stimuli, we compared the performance of four phase synchronization measures, imaginary part of phase-locking value, imaginary part of coherency (ImCoh), phase lag index and weighted phase lag index (wPLI), for detecting stimulus-induced FCs between the contralateral primary and ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortices. The analyses revealed that ImCoh exhibited the best performance for detecting stimulus-induced FCs, followed by the wPLI. We found that amplitude weighting, which is related to computing both ImCoh and wPLI, effectively attenuated the influence of noise contamination. A simulation study modeling noise-contaminated periodograms replicated these findings. The present results suggest that the amplitude-dependent measures, ImCoh followed by wPLI, may have the advantage in detecting stimulus-induced FCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cognitive Enhancement via Neuromodulation and Video Games: Synergistic Effects?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique able to modulate cortical excitability. This modulation may influence areas and networks responsible for specific cognitive processes, and the repetition of the induced temporary changes can produce long-lasting effects. TMS effectiveness may be enhanced when used in conjunction with cognitive training focused on specific cognitive functions. Playing video games can be an optimal cognitive training since it involves different cognitive components and high levels of engagement and motivation. The goal of this study is to assess the synergistic effects of TMS and video game training to enhance cognition, specifically, working memory and executive functions. We conducted a randomized 2 × 3 repeated measures (stimulation × time) study, randomly assigning 27 healthy volunteers to an active intermittent theta-burst stimulation or a sham stimulation group. Participants were assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery before, immediately after, and 15 days after finishing the video game+TMS training. The training consisted of 10 sessions where participants played a 3D platform video game for 1.5 h. After each gaming session, TMS was applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All participants improved their video gaming performance, but we did not find a synergistic effect of stimulation and video game training. Neither had we found cognitive improvements related to the stimulation. We explored possible confounding variables such as age, gender, and early video gaming experience through linear regression. The early video gaming experience was related to improvements in working memory and inhibitory control. This result, although exploratory, highlights the influence of individual variables and previous experiences on brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The “Who” System of the Human Brain: A System for Social Cognition About the Self and Others</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00224</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00224</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are fond of talking about brain systems for the processing of “what” and “where” information about objects and their locations. What is critically missing is the concept of a “who” system dedicated to the neural processing of information about social agents—both the self and others—and their interactions. I propose here the characterization of such a system, one that functions not only in perception but in production as well, such as when recounting stories about oneself and others. The most human-specific features of the “who” system are two complementary systems that I refer to as the other-as-self mechanism and the self-as-other mechanism. The major function of the other-as-self mechanism is to perceive other people egocentrically as proxies of the self, as occurs through the processes of mentalizing and empathizing in both everyday life and in the experience of the theatrical and literary arts. The major function of the self-as-other mechanism is to overtly depict other people during acts of communication through vocal and gestural processes of mimicry, such as occurs during quotation in conversation and through acting in the theatrical arts. Overall, the “who” system of the human brain mediates both perceptual and behavioral aspects of social cognition, and establishes the existential distinction between self and other in human cognition. I present neural models for the instantiation of the “who” system in the human brain and conclude with a discussion of how narrative serves as a foundation for human cognition more generally, what I refer to as narrative-based cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is one of the most significant causes of suffering and disability world-wide, and arguably the most burdensome global health challenge. The growing number of patients suffering from chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, migraine and irritable bowel syndrome, not only reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of pain types, but also our lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have emerged as viable targets for effective chronic pain therapy. However, DRG’s contain different classes of primary sensory neurons including pain-associated nociceptive neurons, non-nociceptive temperature sensing, mechanosensory and chemoreceptive neurons, as well as multiple types of immune and endothelial cells. This cell-population heterogeneity makes investigations of individual subgroups of DRG neurons, such as nociceptors, difficult. In attempts to overcome some of these difficulties, a limited number of immortalized DRG-derived cell lines have been generated over the past few decades. In vitro experiments using DRG-derived cell lines have been useful in understanding sensory neuron function. In addition to retaining phenotypic similarities to primary cultured DRG neurons, these cells offer greater suitability for high throughput assays due to ease of culture, maintenance, growth efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For accurate interpretation and translation of results it is critical, however, that phenotypic similarities and differences of DRG-derived cells lines are methodically compared to native neurons. Published reports to date show notable variability in how these DRG-derived cells are maintained and differentiated. Understanding the cellular and molecular differences stemming from different culture methods, is essential to validate past and future experiments, and enable these cells to be used to their full potential. This review describes currently available DRG-derived cell lines, their known sensory and nociceptor specific molecular profiles, and summarize their morphological features related to differentiation and neurite outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Chasing Protection in Parkinson’s Disease: Does Exercise Reduce Risk and Progression?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exercise may be the most commonly offered yet least consistently followed therapeutic advice for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Epidemiological studies of prospectively followed cohorts have shown a lower risk for later developing PD in healthy people who report moderate to high levels of physical activity, and slower rates of motor and non-motor symptom progression in people with PD who report higher baseline physical activity. In animal models of PD, exercise can reduce inflammation, decrease α-synuclein expression, reduce mitochondrial dysfunction, and increase neurotrophic growth factor expression. Randomized controlled trials of exercise in PD have provided clear evidence for short-term benefits on many PD measurements scales, ranging from disease severity to quality of life. In this review, we present these convergent epidemiological and laboratory data with particular attention to translationally relevant features of exercise (e.g., intensity requirements, gender differences, and associated biomarkers). In the context of these findings we will discuss clinical trial experience, design challenges, and emerging opportunities for determining whether exercise can prevent PD or slow its long-term progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and production of infectious de-novo virus particles.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Acute inhibition of centriolar satellite function and positioning reveals their functions at the primary cilium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000679</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/as_vmQeA6ks/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Özge Z. Aydin, Sevket Onur Taflan, Can Gurkaslar, Elif Nur Firat-Karalar&lt;/p&gt;

Centriolar satellites are dynamic, membraneless granules composed of over 200 proteins. They store, modify, and traffic centrosome and primary cilium proteins, and help to regulate both the biogenesis and some functions of centrosomes and cilium. In most cell types, satellites cluster around the perinuclear centrosome, but their integrity and cellular distribution are dynamically remodeled in response to different stimuli, such as cell cycle cues. Dissecting the specific and temporal functions and mechanisms of satellites and how these are influenced by their cellular positioning and dynamics has been challenging using genetic approaches, particularly in ciliated and proliferating cells. To address this, we developed a chemical-based trafficking assay to rapidly and efficiently redistribute satellites to either the cell periphery or center, and fuse them into stable clusters in a temporally controlled way. Induced satellite clustering at either the periphery or center resulted in antagonistic changes in the pericentrosomal levels of a subset of proteins, revealing a direct and selective role for their positioning in protein targeting and sequestration. Systematic analysis of the interactome of peripheral satellite clusters revealed enrichment of proteins implicated in cilium biogenesis and mitosis. Importantly, induction of peripheral satellite targeting in ciliated cells revealed a function for satellites not just for efficient cilium assembly but also in the maintenance of steady-state cilia and in cilia disassembly by regulating the structural integrity of the ciliary axoneme. Finally, perturbing satellite distribution and dynamics inhibited their mitotic dissolution, and mitotic progression was perturbed only in cells with centrosomal satellite clustering. Collectively, our results for the first time showed a direct link between satellite functions and their pericentrosomal clustering, suggested new mechanisms underlying satellite functions during cilium assembly, and provided a new tool for probing temporal satellite functions in different contexts&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/as_vmQeA6ks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Functional brain connectivity changes across the human life span: From fetal development to old age</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24669?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic of the temporal correlations between brain areas, called functional connectivity (FC), undergoes complex transformations through the life span. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of these changes in the nonpathological brain from fetal life to advanced age. After a brief description of the main methods, we propose that FC development can be divided into four main phases: first, before birth, a strong change in FC leads to the emergence of functional proto‐networks, involving mainly within network short‐range connections. Then, during the first years of life, there is a strong widespread organization of networks which starts with segregation processes followed by a continuous increase in integration. Thereafter, from adolescence to early adulthood, a refinement of existing networks in the brain occurs, characterized by an increase in integrative processes until about 40 years. Middle age constitutes a pivotal period associated with an inversion of the functional brain trajectories with a decrease in segregation process in conjunction to a large‐scale reorganization of between network connections. Studies suggest that these processes are in line with the development of cognitive and sensory functions throughout life as well as their deterioration. During aging, results support the notion of dedifferentiation processes, which refer to the decrease in functional selectivity of the brain regions, resulting in more diffuse and less specialized FC, associated with the disruption of cognitive functions with age. The inversion of developmental processes during aging is in accordance with the developmental models of neuroanatomy for which the latest matured regions are the first to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Conditional and biased regeneration of cone photoreceptor types in the zebrafish retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4d4de5a9-a196-4a96-a4c8-916cae871fef/cne24933-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of the zebrafish, and the stereotypic organization of its retinal cell populations, enable examination of the specificity by which retinal Müller glial cells replace neurons that are lost. Zebrafish have four cone types, with peak sensitivities to red, green, blue, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a targeted cell ablation approach, we found that Müller glia produced cones of all types when all cones, red cones and UV cones were ablated. In contrast, blue cone ablation largely failed to generate cones. The relative proportions of regenerated cells of each type depended on the cone types that were ablated, and was biased toward the major cone type that was lost.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue, or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon nondiscriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of nonablated controls, that is, red &amp;gt; green &amp;gt; UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Amyloidosis is associated with thicker myelin and increased oligodendrogenesis in the adult mouse brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Amyloidosis is associated with thicker myelin and increased oligodendrogenesis in the adult mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7ff1cdb7-bdb8-4881-9331-29b65c1b829f/jnr24672-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myelin structure is altered in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing a pathological variant of the human amyloid precursor protein (&lt;i&gt;APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;APP &lt;/i&gt; mice have longer paranodes, thicker myelin, and shorter nodes of Ranvier than wildtype mice by 3 months of age, however, total axon density and the proportion of axons that were myelinated was normal. Between 4 and 6 months of age, &lt;i&gt;APP &lt;/i&gt; mice have more new oligodendrocytes added to the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria, while total oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell density remained stable, suggesting that new oligodendrocytes may be produced to replace oligodendrocytes lost due to amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaque formation is associated with the focal death of oligodendrocytes and soluble amyloid β impairs the survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to early amyloid pathology remains unclear. To explore this, we performed a histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral characterization of transgenic mice expressing a pathological form of human &lt;i&gt;amyloid precursor protein &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;APP &lt;/i&gt;), containing three single point mutations associated with the development of familial Alzheimer's disease (&lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;, also known as J20 mice). &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice had impaired survival from weaning, were hyperactive by 2 months of age, and developed amyloid plaques by 6 months of age, however, their spatial memory remained intact over this time course. Hippocampal OPC density was normal in P60‐P180 &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice and, by performing whole‐cell patch‐clamp electrophysiology, we found that their membrane properties, including their response to kainate (100 µM), were largely normal. However, by P100, the response of hippocampal OPCs to GABA was elevated in &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. We also found that the nodes of Ranvier were shorter, the paranodes longer, and the myelin thicker for hippocampal axons in young adult &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice compared with wildtype littermates. Additionally, oligodendrogenesis was normal in young adulthood, but increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria of &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice as pathology developed. As the new oligodendrocytes were not associated with a change in total oligodendrocyte number, these cells are likely required for cell replacement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Brain insulin signaling, Alzheimer's disease pathology, and cognitive function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25826?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25826?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations of molecular markers of brain insulin signaling with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognition, among older persons with or without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clinical‐pathologic study was derived from a community‐based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age‐at‐death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age‐at‐death and education). Using ELISA, immunohistochemistry and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo &lt;/i&gt; stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate‐to‐death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD and level of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain IRS1 phosphorylation (pS&lt;sup&gt;307&lt;/sup&gt;IRS1 /total IRS1) and AKT phosphorylation (pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 /total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (&lt;i&gt;p = &lt;/i&gt; 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the &lt;i&gt;ex vivo &lt;/i&gt; brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = −0.212, SE = 0.097; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.031).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hitherto undescribed phenotype of early onset muscular dystrophy associated with sensorineural hearing loss and primary ovarian insufficiency was initially identified in 2 siblings and in subsequent patients with a similar constellation of findings. The goal of this study was to understand the genetic and molecular etiology of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) superimposed on shared haplotype regions to identify the initial biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; followed by &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; Sanger sequencing or WES in 5 additional families with the same phenotype. Molecular modeling, biochemical analysis, laser membrane injury assay, and the generation of a Y259C knock‐in mouse were done.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 11 patients in 6 families carrying 5 different biallelic pathogenic variants in specific domains of &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; were identified. &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; encodes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway, which catalyzes the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, the lipid precursor of geranylgeranylated proteins including small guanosine triphosphatases. In addition to proximal weakness, all but one patient presented with congenital sensorineural hearing loss, and all postpubertal females had primary ovarian insufficiency. Muscle histology was dystrophic, with ultrastructural evidence of autophagic material and large mitochondria in the most severe cases. There was delayed membrane healing after laser injury in patient‐derived myogenic cells, and a knock‐in mouse of one of the mutations (Y259C) resulted in prenatal lethality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of specific &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; mutations defines the cause of a unique form of muscular dystrophy with hearing loss and ovarian insufficiency and points to a novel pathway for this clinical constellation. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosomeric mappings of &lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;6‐LacZ &lt;/i&gt; expression plus relevant gene/protein markers delineated genoarchitectural subdivisions of the adult mouse prethalamus, identified boundaries with hypothalamus, thalamus, and underlying tegmental field, and produced an advanced morphologic model of the mammalian prethalamus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses &lt;i&gt;LacZ &lt;/i&gt; under the control of an intragenic enhancer of &lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dlx6 &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;6‐LacZ &lt;/i&gt;). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including &lt;i&gt;Calb2 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nkx2.2 &lt;/i&gt; ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain in Spinal Fluid Differentiate Multiple System Atrophy from Lewy Body Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25824?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25824?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings to Lewy body synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14) we utilized ELISA to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 16), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;discovery cohort &lt;/i&gt;, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients with perfect separation from CON. ASyn‐PMCA was non‐reactive in all CON, while all MSA samples were positive. In the &lt;i&gt;confirmatory cohort &lt;/i&gt;, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again non‐reactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics than MSA: aggregation occurred later but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Age‐related hearing loss: Why we need to think about sex as a biological variable</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24647?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been known that age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is more common, more severe, and with an earlier onset in men compared to women. Even in the absence of confounding factors such as noise exposure, these sexdifferences in susceptibility to ARHL remain. In the last decade, insight into the pleiotrophic nature by which estrogen signaling can impact multiple signaling mechanisms to mediate downstream changes in gene expression and/or elicit rapid changes in cellular function has rapidly gathered pace, and a role for estrogen signaling in the biological pathways that confer neuroprotection is becoming undeniable. Here I review the evidence why we need to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) when investigating the etiology of ARHL. Loss of auditory function with aging is frequency‐specific and modulated by SABV. Evidence also suggests that differences in cochlear physiology between women and men are already present from birth. Understanding the molecular basis of these sex differences in ARHL will accelerate the development of precision medicine therapies for ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Direct arterial damage and neurovascular unit disruption by mechanical thrombectomy in a rat stroke model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d80db5c3-99c5-4465-b96e-7d075819dde1/jnr24671-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that MT causes mechanical damage of vessel intima, as well as neutrophil, VEGF, and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption leading to the increase of infarct volume and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, when combined with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke that could cause hemorrhagic complications. We aimed to evaluate the pathology of MT‐induced arterial damage and neurovascular unit (NVU) disruption in relation to tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) injection for acute ischemic stroke. We induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male SHR/Izm rats for 2 hr. This was followed by reperfusion with/without tPA (3 mg/kg) and “rough suture” insertion that mimicked MT once or thrice (MT1 or MT3). Compared with the control group, the tPA + MT3 group presented with an increase in the cerebral infarct and hemorrhage with severer IgG leakage. Moreover, structural damage reaching the tunica media was detected in the MT3 and tPA + MT3 groups. The tPA + MT3 group presented with increased matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression with some MMP9‐positive cells expressing a neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase. Furthermore, basal lamina detachment from astrocyte foot processes was observed in the tPA + MT1 and tPA + MT3 groups. These findings suggest that MT causes direct arterial damage, as well as VEGF and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, especially when combined with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Lateral Prefrontal Theta Oscillations Reflect Proactive Cognitive Control Impairment in Males With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00037</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00037</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder in which children present prefrontal cortex (PFC) related functions deficit. Proactive cognitive control is a process that anticipates the requirement of cognitive control and crucially depends on the maturity of the PFC. Since this process is important to ADHD symptomatology, we here test the hypothesis that children with ADHD have proactive cognitive control impairments and that these impairments are reflected in the PFC oscillatory activity. We recorded EEG signals from 29 male children with ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) male children while they performed a Go-Nogo task, where the likelihood of a Nogo stimulus increased while a sequence of consecutive Go stimuli elapsed. TD children showed proactive cognitive control by increasing their reaction time (RT) concerning the number of preceding Go stimuli, whereas children with ADHD did not. This adaptation was related to modulations in both P3a potential and lateral prefrontal theta oscillation for TD children. Children with ADHD as a group did not demonstrate either P3a or theta modulation. But, individual variation in theta activity was correlated with the ADHD symptomatology. The results depict a neurobiological mechanism of proactive cognitive control impairments in children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dorsal-Ventral Differences in Modulation of Synaptic Transmission in the Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00024</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional diversification along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is a rapidly growing concept. Modulation of synaptic transmission by neurotransmitter receptors may importantly contribute to specialization of local intrinsic network function along the hippocampus. In the present study, using transverse slices from the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus of adult rats and recordings of evoked field postsynaptic excitatory potentials (fEPSPs) from the CA1 stratum radiatum, we aimed to compare modulation of synaptic transmission between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus. We found that transient heterosynaptic depression (tHSD, &amp;lt;2 s), a physiologically relevant phenomenon of regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission induced by paired stimulation of two independent inputs to stratum radiatum of CA1 field, has an increased magnitude and duration in the ventral hippocampus, presumably contributing to increased input segregation in this segment of the hippocampus. GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, adenosine A1 receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels appear to contribute differently to tHSD in the two hippocampal segments; GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs play a predominant role in the ventral hippocampus while both GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and A1Rs play important roles in the dorsal hippocampus. Activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors by an exogenous agonist, baclofen, robustly and reversibly modulated both the initial fast and the late slow components of excitatory synaptic transmission, expressed by the fEPSPslope and fEPSP decay time constant (fEPSP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively. Specifically, baclofen suppressed fEPSP slope more in the ventral than in the dorsal hippocampus and enhanced fEPSP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; more in the dorsal than in the ventral hippocampus. Also, baclofen enhanced paired-pulse facilitation in the two hippocampal segments similarly. Blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors did not affect basal paired-pulse facilitation in either hippocampal segment. We propose that the revealed dorsal-ventral differences in modulation of synaptic transmission may provide a means for specialization of information processing in the local neuronal circuits, thereby significantly contributing to diversifying neuronal network functioning along the dorsal-ventral axis of hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Potential Value of Targeting Ferroptosis in Early Brain Injury After Acute CNS Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00110</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00110</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acute central nervous system (CNS) disease is very common and with high mortality. Many basic studies have confirmed the molecular mechanism of early brain injury (EBI) after acute CNS disease. Neuron death and dysfunction are important reasons for the neurological dysfunction in patients with acute CNS disease. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death, the classical characteristic of which is based on the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid reactive oxygen species. Previous studies have indicated that this mechanism is critical in the cell death events observed in many diseases, including cancer, tumor resistance, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Ferroptosis may also play a very important role in EBI after acute CNS disease. Unresolved issues include the relationship between ferroptosis and other forms of cell death after acute CNS disease, the specific molecular mechanisms of EBI, the strategies to activate or inhibit ferroptosis to achieve desirable attenuation of EBI, and the need to find new molecular markers of ferroptosis that can be used to detect and study this process in vivo after acute CNS disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Shortage of oxygen and nutrients in the brain induces the release of glutamate and ATP that can cause excitotoxicity and contribute to neuronal and glial damage. Our understanding of the mechanisms of ATP release and toxicity in cerebrovascular diseases is incomplete. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge about the participation of key elements in the ATP-mediated deleterious effects in these pathologies. This includes pannexin-1 hemichannels, calcium homeostasis modulator-1 (CALHM1), purinergic P2X7 receptors, and other intermediaries of CNS injury downstream of ATP release. Available data together with recent pharmacological developments in purinergic signaling may constitute a new opportunity to translate preclinical findings into more effective therapies in cerebrovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Metformin Protects From Rotenone–Induced Nigrostriatal Neuronal Death in Adult Mice by Activating AMPK-FOXO3 Signaling and Mitigation of Angiogenesis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Many studies have documented the role of oxidative stress and angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of PD. Metformin (MTF) is an antidiabetic medication and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulator that has shown antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties in many disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effect of MTF in a mouse model of rotenone-prompted PD with a highlight on its influence on the AMPK/forkhead box transcription factor O3 (FOXO3) pathway and striatal angiogenesis. In the running study, PD was induced in mice using repeated doses of rotenone and concomitantly treated with MTF 100 or 200 mg/kg/day for 18 days. Rotarod and pole tests were used to examine the animals’ motor functionality. After that, animals were sacrificed, and brains were isolated and processed for immunohistochemical investigations or biochemical analyses. Oxidant stress and angiogenic markers were measured, including reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), hemoxygenase-1, thioredoxin, AMPK, FOXO3, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Results indicated that MTF improved animals’ motor function, improved striatal glutathione, Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1, and thioredoxin. Furthermore, MTF upregulated AMPK-FOXO3 proteins and reduced VEGF and cleaved caspase 3. MTF also increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)–stained neurons in the substantia nigra neurons and in striatal neuronal terminals. This study is the first to highlight that the neuroprotective role of MTF is mediated through activation of AMPK-FOXO3 signaling and inhibition of the proangiogenic factor, VEGF. Further studies are warranted to confirm this mechanism in other models of PD and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Microglial Sirtuin 2 Shapes Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal Slices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00614</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglial cells have emerged as crucial players in synaptic plasticity during development and adulthood, and also in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. Here we found that decreased levels of Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) deacetylase in microglia affects hippocampal synaptic plasticity under inflammatory conditions. The results show that long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude recorded from hippocampal slices of wild type mice does not differ between those exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory stimulus, or BSA. However, LTP recorded from hippocampal slices of microglial-specific Sirt2 deficient (Sirt2&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice was significantly impaired by LPS. Importantly, LTP values were restored by memantine, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These results indicate that microglial Sirt2 prevents NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in hippocampal slices in response to an inflammatory signal such as LPS. Overall, our data suggest a key-protective role for microglial Sirt2 in mnesic deficits associated with neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Improving the clinical translation of animal-based neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) therapies to humans requires an understanding of intrinsic human and animal cell characteristics. We report a novel in vitro method to assess spinal cord NSPCs from a small (rodent) and large (porcine) animal model in comparison to human NSPCs. To extract live adult human, porcine, and rodent spinal cord tissue, we illustrate a strategy using an anterior or posterior approach that was simulated in a porcine model. The initial expansion of primary NSPCs is carried out using the neurosphere assay followed by a pharmacological treatment phase during which NSPCs derived from humans, porcines, and rodents are assessed in parallel using the same defined parameters. Using this model, NSPCs from all species demonstrated multi-lineage differentiation and self-renewal. Importantly, these methods provide conditions to enable the direct comparison of species-dependent cell behavior in response to specific exogenous signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Therapeutic Effects of Transplanted Exosomes Containing miR-29b to a Rat Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00564</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with no definite treatment. The expression of miR-29 family is significantly reduced in AD, suggesting a part for the family members in pathogenesis of the disease. The recent emergence of microRNA (miRNA)–based therapeutic approaches is emphasized on the efficiency of miRNA transfer to target cells. The endogenously made secretory vesicles could provide a biological vehicle for drug delivery. Characteristics such as small sizes, the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, the specificity in binding to the right target cells, and most importantly the capacity to be engineered as drug carriers have made exosomes desirable vehicles to deliver genetic materials to the central nervous system. Here, we transfected rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) with recombinant expression vectors, carrying either mir-29a or mir-29b precursor sequences. A significant overexpression of miR-29 and downregulation of their targets genes, BACE1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) and BIM [Bcl−2 interacting mediator of cell death (BCL2-like 11)], were confirmed in the transfected cells. Then, we confirmed the packaging of miR-29 in exosomes secreted from the transfected cells. Finally, we investigated a possible therapeutic effect of the engineered exosomes to reduce the pathological effects of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in a rat model of AD. Aβ–treated model rats showed some deficits in spatial learning and memory. However, in animals injected with miR-29–containing exosomes at CA1 (cornu ammonis area), the aforementioned impairments were prevented. In conclusion, our findings provide a new approach for the packaging of miR-29 in exosomes and that the engineered exosomes might have a therapeutic potential in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Deep Learning-Based Model for Classification of Different Subtypes of Subcortical Vascular Cognitive Impairment With FLAIR</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00557</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00557</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning methods have shown their great capability of extracting high-level features from image and have been used for effective medical imaging classification recently. However, training samples of medical images are restricted by the amount of patients as well as medical ethics issues, making it hard to train the neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end three-dimensional (3D) attention-based residual neural network (ResNet) architecture to classify different subtypes of subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) with single-shot T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. Our aim is to develop a convolutional neural network to provide a convenient and effective way to assist doctors in the diagnosis and early treatment of the different subtypes of SVCI. The experiment data in this paper are collected from 242 patients from the Neurology Department of Renji Hospital, including 78 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), 70 nonamnestic MCI (na-MCI), and 94 no cognitive impairment (NCI). The accuracy of our proposed model has reached 98.6% on a training set and 97.3% on a validation set. The test accuracy on an untrained testing set reaches 93.8% with robustness. Our proposed method can provide a convenient and effective way to assist doctors in the diagnosis and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Evoking Apparent Moving Sensation in the Hand via Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00534</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00534</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The restoration of sensory feedback in amputees plays a fundamental role in the prosthesis control and in the communication on the afferent channel between hand and brain. The literature shows that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be a promising non-invasive technique to elicit sensory feedback in amputees, especially in the lower limb through the phenomenon of apparent moving sensation (AMS). It consists of delivering a sensation that moves along a specific part of the body. This study proposes to use TENS to elicit tactile sensations and adopt AMS to reproduce moving sensations on the hand, such as those related to an object moving in the hand or slipping upward or downward. To this purpose, the developed experimental protocol consists of two phases: (i) the mapping of the evoked sensations and (ii) the generation of the AMS. In the latter phase, the pulse amplitude variation (PAV), the pulse width variation (PWV), and the interstimulus delay modulation (ISDM) methods were compared. For the comparative analysis, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (P &amp;lt; 0.016) was carried out on the success rate and on the ranking of methods expressed by the subjects. Results from the mapping protocol show that the delivered sensations were mostly described by the subjects as almost natural and superficial tingling. Results from the AMS protocol show that, for each movement direction, the success rate of ISDM method is higher than that of PWV and PAV and significantly higher than that of PAV for the ulnar-median direction. It recreates an AMS in the hand that effectively allows discriminating the type of sensation and distinguishing the movement direction. Moreover, ISDM was ranked by the subjects as the favorite method for recreating a well-defined and comfortable moving sensation only in the median-ulnar direction. For the ranking results, there was not a statistically significant difference among the methods. The experiments confirmed the good potential of recreating an AMS in the hand through TENS. This encourages to push forward this study on amputees and integrate it in the closed-loop control of a prosthetic system, in order to enable full control of grasp stability and prevent the objects from slippage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of tDCS Over the Right Inferior Parietal Lobule on Mind-Wandering Propensity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00230</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00230</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mind-wandering is associated with switching our attention to internally directed thoughts and is by definition an intrinsic, self-generated cognitive function. Interestingly, previous research showed that it may be possible to modulate its propensity externally, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting different regions in the default mode and executive control networks (ECNs). However, these studies used highly heterogeneous montages (targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), or both concurrently), often showed contradicting results, and in many cases failed to replicate. Our study aimed to establish whether tDCS of the default mode network (DMN), via targeting the right IPL alone, could modulate mind-wandering propensity using a within-subjects double-blind, counterbalanced design. Participants completed sustained attention to response task (SART) interspersed with thought-probes to capture their subjective reports of mind-wandering before and after receiving anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the right IPL (with the reference over the left cheek). We found evidence for the lack of an effect of stimulation on subjective reports of mind-wandering (JZS-BF&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.19), as well as on performance on the SART task (errors (JZS-BF&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.79) and reaction time (JZS-BF&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.94). Overall, we failed to replicate previous reports of successful modulations of mind-wandering propensity with tDCS over the IPL, instead of providing evidence in support of the lack of an effect. This and other recent unsuccessful replications call into question whether it is indeed possible to externally modulate spontaneous or self-generated cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dissociable Networks of the Lateral/Medial Mammillary Body in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00228</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00228</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammillary body (MB) has been thought to implement mnemonic functions. Although recent animal studies have revealed dissociable roles of the lateral and medial parts of the MB, the dissociable roles of the lateral/medial MB in the human brain is still unclear. Functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively inspect the intricate functional organization of the human MB with a high degree of spatial resolution. The present study divided the human MB into lateral and medial parts and examined their functional connectivity with the hippocampal formation, tegmental nuclei, and anterior thalamus. The subiculum of the hippocampal formation was more strongly connected with the medial part than with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the pre/parasubiculum was more strongly connected with the lateral part than with the medial part of the MB. The dorsal tegmental nucleus was connected more strongly with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the ventral tegmental nucleus showed an opposite pattern. The anterior thalamus was connected more strongly with the medial part of the MB. These results confirm the extant animal literature on the lateral/medial MB and provide evidence on the parallel but dissociable systems involving the MB that ascribe mnemonic and spatial-navigation functions to the medial and lateral MBs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of Short-Term Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) on Brain Processing of Food Cues: An Electrophysiological Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00206</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00206</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. Modulating vagal activity via electrical stimulation (VNS) in patients and animal studies caused changes in food intake, energy metabolism, and body weight. However, the moderating impact of cognitive processes on VNS effects on eating behavior has not been investigated so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis: We hypothesized that transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) affects food intake by altering cognitive functions relevant to the processing of food-related information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Using a repeated-measurement design, we applied tVNS and a sham stimulation for 2 h on two different days in normal-weight subjects. We recorded standard scalp EEG while subjects watched food and object pictures presented in an oddball task. We analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) P1, P2, N2, and LPP and also examined the amount of consumed food and eating duration in a free-choice test meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant differences between stimulations were observed for the P1, P2, and N2 amplitudes. However, we found no tVNS-dependent modulation of food intake nor a specific food-related stimulation effect on the ERPs. Further analyses revealed a negative relationship between P2 amplitude and food intake for the sham stimulation. Significant effects are additionally confirmed by Bayesian statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study demonstrates tVNS’ impact on visual processing. Since the effects were similar between food and object stimuli, a general effect on visual perceptual processing can be assumed. More detailed investigations of these effects and their relationship with food intake and metabolism seem reasonable for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopamine Suppresses Synaptic Responses of Fan Cells in the Lateral Entorhinal Cortex to Olfactory Bulb Input in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is involved in odor discrimination, odor-associative multimodal memory, and neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. It receives direct axonal projections from both olfactory bulb (OB) output neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the cellular targets in LEC receiving direct synaptic input from OB output neuron, the functional characteristics of these synapses, and whether or how dopamine (DA) modulates the OB-LEC pathway remain undetermined. We addressed these questions in the present study by combing optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches with four major findings: (1) selective activation of OB input elicited glutamate-mediated monosynaptic responses in all fan cells, the major output neurons in layer II of the LEC; (2) this excitatory synaptic transmission exhibited robust paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), a presynaptically derived short-term synaptic plasticity; (3) DA dramatically attenuated the strength of the OB input-fan cell synaptic transmission via activation of D1 receptors; and (4) DA altered the PPF of this transmission but neither intrinsic properties of postsynaptic neurons nor the kinetic profile of postsynaptic responses, suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms underlie the DA inhibitory actions. This study for the first time demonstrates the FCs in the LEC layer II as the postsynaptic target of direct OB input and characterizes DA modulation of the OB input-fan cell pathway. These findings set the foundation for future studies to examine the synaptic transmission from the OB output neuron axon terminals to other potential cell types in the LEC and to pinpoint the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits associated with DA-relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Reduced Fractalkine Levels Lead to Striatal Synaptic Plasticity Deficits in Huntington’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder in which the striatum is the most affected brain region. Although a chronic inflammatory microglial reaction that amplifies disease progression has been described in HD patients, some murine models develop symptoms without inflammatory microglial activation. Thus, dysfunction of non-inflammatory microglial activity could also contribute to the early HD pathological process. Here, we show the involvement of microglia and particularly fractalkine signaling in the striatal synaptic dysfunction of R6/1 mice. We found reduced fractalkine gene expression and protein concentration in R6/1 striata from 8 to 20 weeks of age. Consistently, we also observed a down-regulation of fractalkine levels in the putamen of HD patients and in HD patient hiPSC-derived neurons. Automated cell morphology analysis showed a non-inflammatory ramified microglia in the striatum of R6/1 mice. However, we found increased PSD-95-positive puncta inside microglia, indicative of synaptic pruning, before HD motor symptoms start to manifest. Indeed, microglia appeared to be essential for striatal synaptic function, as the inhibition of microglial activity with minocycline impaired the induction of corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD) in wild-type mice. Notably, fractalkine administration restored impaired corticostriatal LTD in R6/1 mice. Our results unveil a role for fractalkine-dependent neuron-microglia interactions in the early striatal synaptic dysfunction characteristic of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Evidence for Reciprocal Structural Network Interactions Between Bilateral Crus Lobes and Broca’s Complex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While the proximal dentatothalamocortical tracts are considered pivotal in the occurrence of cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) after medulloblastoma resection, how the cerebellum participates in motor–speech networks through direct structural connectivity is still unclear. Via tractography, we provide evidence of cerebellar streamlines projecting into the left inferior frontal gyrus majorly connecting Broca’s complex and the bilateral Crus lobes. The streamlines, named Crus–Broca tracts, originated from the bilateral Crus lobes, synapsed onto the dentate nucleus, ascended into the superior cerebellar peduncle (where these streamlines were closely superior to the superior border of the supratonsillar cleft and the superolateral roof of the fourth ventricle), surprisingly bypassed the left red nucleus and the left thalamus, and ended at the subregions of Broca’s complex. The streamlines, named Broca–Crus tracts, originated from the subregions of Broca’s complex and ended predominantly at the right Crus lobes. If verified, the existence of these connections would support the notion of the bilateral cerebellums’ participation in motor–speech planning, and the anatomical relationship of Broca–Crus tracts with the supratonsillar cleft would merit consideration for further studies aimed at further elucidating CMS mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: EEG Slowing and Axial Motor Impairment Are Independent Predictors of Cognitive Worsening in a Three-Year Cohort of Patients With Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00171</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to determine whether the combination of two parameters: (a) score of axial impairment and limb rigidity (SAILR) with (b) EEG global relative median power in the frequency range theta 4–8 Hz (GRMPT) predicted cognitive outcome in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) better than each of these measures alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 47 non-demented patients with PD were examined and re-examined after 3 years. At both time-points, the patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological assessment and EEG in eyes-closed resting-state condition. The results of cognitive tests were normalized and individually summarized to obtain a “global cognitive score” (GCS). Change of GCS was used to represent cognitive changes over time. GRMPT and SAILR was used for further analysis. Linear regression models were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: GRMPT and SAILR independently predicted cognitive change. Combination of GRMPT and SAILR improved the significance of the regression model as compared to using each of these measures alone. GRMPT and SAILR only slightly correlate between each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The combination of axial signs and rigidity with quantitative EEG improves early identification of patients with PD prone to severe cognitive decline. GRMPT and SAILR seem to reflect different disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance Combination of EEG and axial motor impairment assessment may be a valuable marker in the cognitive prognosis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a unique type of GABAergic interneuron that selectively innervate the axon initial segment (AIS) of excitatory pyramidal neurons; the subcellular domain where action potentials are initiated. The proper genesis and maturation of ChCs is critical for regulating neural ensemble firing in the neocortex throughout development and adulthood. Recently, genetic and molecular studies have shed new light on the complex innerworkings of ChCs in health and disease. This review presents an overview of recent studies on the developmental origins, migratory properties, and morphology of ChCs.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Early transmission of sensitive strain slows down emergence of drug resistance in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The spread of drug resistance of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; parasites is a challenge towards malaria elimination. &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; has shown an early and severe drug resistance in comparison to &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; in various countries. In fact, &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; differs in its life cycle and treatment in various factors: development and duration of sexual parasite forms differ, symptoms severity are unequal, relapses present only in &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; cases and the Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is only mandatory in &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; cases. We compared the spread of drug resistance for both species through two compartmental models using ordinary differential equations. The model structure describes how sensitive and resistant parasite strains infect a human population treated with antimalarials. We found that an early transmission,i.e., before treatment and low effectiveness of drug coverage, supports the prevalence of sensitive parasites delaying the emergence of resistant &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt;. These results imply that earlier attention of both symptomatic cases and reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; are essential in controlling transmission but also accelerate the spread of drug resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HBlonqsj4cI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Circuits with broken fibration symmetries perform core logic computations in biological networks</title>

We show that logic computational circuits in gene regulatory networks arise from a fibration symmetry breaking in the network structure. From this idea we implement a constructive procedure that reveals a hierarchy of genetic circuits, ubiquitous across species, that are surprising analogues to the emblematic circuits of solid-state electronics: starting from the transistor and progressing to ring oscillators, current-mirror circuits to toggle switches and flip-flops. These canonical variants serve fundamental operations of synchronization and clocks (in their symmetric states) and memory storage (in their broken symmetry states). These conclusions introduce a theoretically principled strategy to search for computational building blocks in biological networks, and present a systematic route to design synthetic biological circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1KEJ3Quw1fY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Classification of Facial Expressions for Intended Display of Emotions Using Brain‐Computer Interfaces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25821?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Facial expressions are important for intentional display of emotions in social interaction. For people with severe paralysis, the ability to intentionally display emotions can be impaired. Current brain‐computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for linguistic communication but are cumbersome for expressing emotions. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a BCI to display emotions by decoding facial expressions. We used electrocorticographic recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of people with refractory epilepsy and classified 5 facial expressions, based on neural activity. The mean classification accuracy was 72%. This approach could be a promising avenue for development of BCI‐based solutions for fast communication of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Statistical Changes of Involuntary Head Motion Signatures Across Autism and Controls of the ABIDE Repository</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00023</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The DSM-5 definition of autism spectrum disorders includes sensory issues and part of the sensory information that the brain continuously receives comes from kinesthetic reafference, in the form of self-generated motions, including those that the nervous systems produce at rest. Some of the movements that we self-generate are deliberate, while some occur spontaneously, consequentially following those that we can control. Yet, some motions occur involuntarily, largely beneath our awareness. We do not know much about involuntary motions across development, but these motions typically manifest during resting state in fMRI studies. Here we ask in a large data set from the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange repository, whether the stochastic signatures of variability in the involuntary motions of the head typically shift with age. We further ask if those motions registered from individuals with autism show a significant departure from the normative data as we examine different age groups selected at random from cross-sections of the population. We find significant shifts in statistical features of typical levels of involuntary head motions for different age groups. Further, we find that in autism these changes also manifest in non-uniform ways, and that they significantly differ from their age-matched groups. The results suggest that the levels of random involuntary motor noise are elevated in autism across age groups. This calls for the use of different age-appropriate statistical models in research that involves dynamically changing signals self-generated by the nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Retinal and Brain Organoids: Bridging the Gap Between in vivo Physiology and in vitro Micro-Physiology for the Study of Alzheimer’s Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent progress in tissue engineering has led to increasingly complex approaches to investigate human neurodegenerative diseases in vitro, such as Alzheimer’s disease, aiming to provide more functional and physiological models for the study of their pathogenesis, and possibly the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical and retinal organoids represent a novel class of in vitro three-dimensional models capable to recapitulate with a high similarity the structure and the complexity of the native brain and retinal tissues, thus providing a framework for better mimicking in a dish the patient’s disease features. This review aims to discuss progress made over the years in the field of in vitro three-dimensional cell culture systems, and the benefits and disadvantages related to a possible application of organoids for the study of neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer’s disease, providing a promising breakthrough toward a personalized medicine approach and the reduction in the use of humanized animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Parkinson’s Disease and the Gut: Future Perspectives for Early Diagnosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and at the cellular level by the formation of Lewy bodies in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the onset of the disease is believed to be localized to peripheral organs, particularly the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the olfactory bulb sooner before neuropathological changes occur in the CNS. Patients already in the pre-motor stage of PD suffer from various digestive problems and/or due to significant changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome in this early stage of the disease. Detailed analyses of patient biopsies and autopsies as well as animal models of neuropathological changes characteristic of PD provided important information on the pathology or treatment of PD symptoms. However, presently is not clarified (i) the specific tissue in the GIT where the pathological processes associated with PD is initiated; (ii) the mechanism by which these processes are disseminated to the CNS or other tissues within the GIT; and (iii) which neuropathological changes could also serve as a reliable diagnostic marker of the premotor stages of PD, or (iv) which type of GIT tissue would be the most appropriate choice for routine examination of patient biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: EEG Channel-Selection Method for Epileptic-Seizure Classification Based on Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00593</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00593</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a multi-objective optimization method for electroencephalographic (EEG) channel selection based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) for epileptic-seizure classification. We tested the method on EEG data of 24 patients from the CHB-MIT public dataset. The procedure starts by decomposing the EEG data from each channel into different frequency bands using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then for each sub-band four features are extracted; two energy values and two fractal dimension values. The obtained feature vectors are then iteratively tested for solving two unconstrained objectives by NSGA-II or NSGA-III; to maximize classification accuracy and to reduce the number of EEG channels required for epileptic seizure classification. Our results have shown accuracies of up to 1.00 with only one EEG channel. Interestingly, when using all the EEG channels available, lower accuracies were achieved compared to the case when EEG channels were selected by NSGA-II or NSGA-III; i.e., in patient 19 we obtained an accuracy of 0.95 using all the channels and 0.975 using only two channels selected by NSGA-III. The results obtained are encouraging and it has been shown that it is possible to classify epileptic seizures using a few electrodes, which provide evidence for the future development of portable EEG seizure detection devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Protocol for Comparing Dry and Wet EEG Electrodes During Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00586</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Sleep is commonly assessed by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the sleeping brain. As sleep assessments in a lab environment are cumbersome for both the participant and researcher, it would be highly desirable to record sleep EEG with a user-friendly and mobile device. Dry electrodes that are reusable, low-cost, and easy to apply would be an essential component of such a device. In this study, we developed a testing protocol to investigate the performance of novel flat-type dry electrodes for sleep EEG recordings in free-living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Overnight sleep EEG, electrooculogram and electromyogram of four young and healthy participants were recorded at home. Two identical ambulatory recording devices, one using novel flat-type dry electrodes, the other using self-adhesive pre-gelled electrodes, simultaneously recorded sleep EEG. Between both electrode types, we then compared the signal quality, the incidence of artifacts, the sensitivity, specificity and inter-scoring reliability (Cohen’s kappa) of sleep staging, as well as the agreement of important characteristics of sleep-specific EEG microstructure features, such as slow waves (0.5–4 Hz) and sleep spindles (10–16 Hz).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our testing protocol comprehensively compared the two electrode types on a macro- and microstructure level of sleep. The dry and pre-gelled electrodes both had comparable signal quality and sleep staging was feasible with both electrodes. Also, slow-wave and spindle characteristics were similar. However, sweat artifacts were more prevalent in the flat-type dry electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;With a reliable testing protocol, the performance of dry electrodes can be compared to reference technologies and objectively assessed also in free-living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 and α-Synuclein: Distinct or Synergistic Players in Parkinson’s Disease?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00577</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00577</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by prominent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and aggregation of the protein α-synuclein within intraneuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Ninety percent of PD cases are idiopathic while the remaining 10% are associated with gene mutations that affect cellular functions ranging from kinase activity to mitochondrial quality control, hinting at a multifactorial disease process. Mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA (the gene coding for α-synuclein) cause monogenic forms of autosomal dominant PD, and polymorphisms in either gene are also associated with increased risk of idiopathic PD. Although Lewy bodies are a defining neuropathological feature of PD, an appreciable subset of patients with LRRK2 mutations present with a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from idiopathic PD but lack Lewy pathology at autopsy, suggesting that LRRK2-mediated PD may occur independently of α-synuclein aggregation. Here, we examine whether LRRK2 and α-synuclein, as mediators of neurodegeneration in PD, exist in common or distinct pathways. Specifically, we review evidence from preclinical models and human neuropathological studies examining interactions between the two proteins. Elucidating the degree of interplay between LRRK2 and α-synuclein will be necessary for treatment stratification once effective targeted disease-modifying therapies are developed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Exciting Complexity: The Role of Motor Circuit Elements in ALS Pathophysiology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease, characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons. Despite decades of research, we still to date lack a cure or disease modifying treatment, emphasizing the need for a much-improved insight into disease mechanisms and cell type vulnerability. Altered neuronal excitability is a common phenomenon reported in ALS patients, as well as in animal models of the disease, but the cellular and circuit processes involved, as well as the causal relevance of those observations to molecular alterations and final cell death, remain poorly understood. Here, we review evidence from clinical studies, cell type-specific electrophysiology, genetic manipulations and molecular characterizations in animal models and culture experiments, which argue for a causal involvement of complex alterations of structure, function and connectivity of different neuronal subtypes within the cortical and spinal cord motor circuitries. We also summarize the current knowledge regarding the detrimental role of astrocytes and reassess the frequently proposed hypothesis of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity with respect to changes in neuronal excitability. Together, these findings suggest multifaceted cell type-, brain area- and disease stage- specific disturbances of the excitation/inhibition balance as a cardinal aspect of ALS pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in neuropathic pain due to brachial plexus avulsion injury (BPAI) and related changes in the metabolic brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Neuropathic pain model due to BPAI was established in adult female Sprague–Dawley rats. EA stimulations (2/15 Hz, 30 min/day, 5-day intervention followed by 2-day rest in each session) were applied to the fifth–seventh cervical “Jiaji” acupoints on the noninjured side from 1st to 12th weeks following BPAI (EA group, n = 8). Three control groups included sham EA (nonelectrical acupuncture applied to 3 mm lateral to the real “Jiaji” acupoints), BPAI-only, and normal rats (no particular intervention; eight rats in each group). Thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of the noninjured forepaw was regularly tested to evaluate the threshold of thermalgesia. Small animal [fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;-glucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) PET/CT scans of brain were conducted at the end of 4th, 12th, and 16th weeks to explore metabolic alterations of brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the EA group, the TWL of the noninjured forepaw significantly decreased following BPAI and then increased following EA stimulation, compared with sham EA (P &amp;lt; 0.001). The metabolic brain connectivity among somatosensory cortex (SC), motor cortex (MC), caudate putamen (Cpu), and dorsolateral thalamus (DLT) in bilateral hemispheres decreased throughout the 16 weeks’ observation in the BPAI-only group, compared with the normal rats (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the EA group, the strength of connectivity among the above regions were found to be increased at the end of 4th week following BPAI modeling, decreased at 12th week, and then increased again at 16th week (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The changes in metabolic connectivity were uncharacteristic and dispersed in the sham EA group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The study revealed long-term and extensive changes of metabolic brain connectivity in EA-treated BPAI-induced neuropathic pain rats. Bilateral sensorimotor and pain-related brain regions were mainly involved in this process. It indicated that modulation of brain metabolic connectivity might be an important mechanism of analgesic effect in EA stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Homogeneous and Narrow Bandwidth of Spike Initiation in Rat L1 Cortical Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00118</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cortical layer 1 (L1) contains a population of GABAergic interneurons, considered a key component of information integration, processing, and relaying in neocortical networks. In fact, L1 interneurons combine top–down information with feed-forward sensory inputs in layer 2/3 and 5 pyramidal cells (PCs), while filtering their incoming signals. Despite the importance of L1 for network emerging phenomena, little is known on the dynamics of the spike initiation and the encoding properties of its neurons. Using acute brain tissue slices from the rat neocortex, combined with the analysis of an existing database of model neurons, we investigated the dynamical transfer properties of these cells by sampling an entire population of known “electrical classes” and comparing experiments and model predictions. We found the bandwidth of spike initiation to be significantly narrower than in L2/3 and 5 PCs, with values below 100 cycle/s, but without significant heterogeneity in the cell response properties across distinct electrical types. The upper limit of the neuronal bandwidth was significantly correlated to the mean firing rate, as anticipated from theoretical studies but not reported for PCs. At high spectral frequencies, the magnitude of the neuronal response attenuated as a power-law, with an exponent significantly smaller than what was reported for pyramidal neurons and reminiscent of the dynamics of a “leaky” integrate-and-fire model of spike initiation. Finally, most of our in vitro results matched quantitatively the numerical simulations of the models as a further contribution to independently validate the models against novel experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Voxel-Based Morphometry Reveals a Correlation Between Bone Mineral Density Loss and Reduced Cortical Gray Matter Volume in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00178</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00178</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) was associated with poorer cognitive function and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, objective evidence for the relationship between osteoporosis and AD in humans has not been extensively described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the relationships between BMD and the cortical volumes of brain regions vulnerable to AD; hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and angular gyrus, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), to investigate the association between bone loss and AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A cohort of 149 consecutive elderly participants who complained of memory disturbance underwent high-resolution structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We used SPM12 software to conduct a voxel-based multiple regression analysis to examine the association between femoral neck BMD values and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) on structural T1-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After adjusting for subject age, gender, total brain volume (TBV), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, the multiple regression analysis showed significant correlations between BMD loss and rGMV decline in the left precuneus, which is an important neural network hub vulnerable to AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These data suggest that the bone and brain communicate with each other, as in “bone-brain crosstalk,” and that control of BMD factors could contribute to cognitive function and help prevent AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Genistein Attenuates Acute Cerebral Ischemic Damage by Inhibiting the NLRP3 Inflammasome in Reproductively Senescent Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postmenopausal women have a higher incidence of stroke compared to the age-matched males, and the estrogen was thought to be the main cause of such difference. However, estrogen replacement therapy for the prevention of postmenopausal stroke shows controversial results and is widely disputed because of its serious side effects after chronic administration. Genistein (Gen), a natural phytestrogen with fewer side effects, has a protective effect against cerebral ischemia damage. However, whether Gen could effectively prevent postmenopausal stroke has not been elucidated. In the current study, reproductively senescent mice were treated with Gen (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks before having transient cerebral ischemia insults. Neurological scores, infarct volumes, and cell apoptosis were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion. The levels of inflammatory factors and nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-related proteins were also examined. The results showed that Gen treatment reduced infarct volumes, improved neurological scores, attenuated apoptosis, and decreased inflammatory factor release. The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins in microglia was downregulated by Gen. However, the overexpression of NLRP3 in microglia abrogated the Gen-induced inhibition of inflammatory factor release and reversed the neuroprotective effect of Gen. Taken together, the results suggest that Gen treatment could attenuate the acute injury induced by cerebral ischemia in reproductively senescent mice via the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia, indicating that Gen could be a candidate drug for the treatment of stroke in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: SRC-1 Knockout Exerts No Effect on Amyloid β Deposition in APP/PS1 Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00145</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) is the key coactivator because of its transcriptional activity. Previous studies have shown that SRC-1 is abundant in the hippocampus and has been implicated in cognition. SRC-1 is also related to some major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), such as a decline in estrogen and aging, however, whether SRC-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear. In this study, we established SRC-1 knockout in AD mice by cross breeding SRC-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice with APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and investigated the expression of some synaptic proteins, the amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, and activation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1×SRC-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The results showed that SRC-1 knockout neither affects the Aβ plaque and activation of glia, nor changes the expression of synaptic proteins in AD model mice. The above results suggest that the complete deletion of SRC-1 in the embryo exerts no effect on the pathogenesis of APP/PS1 mice. Nevertheless, this study could not eliminate the possible role of SRC-1 in the development of AD due to the lack of observation of other events in AD such as tau hyperphosphorylation and the limitation of the animal model employed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Downregulation of hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated channels (HCN) in the hippocampus of patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE‐HS)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23219?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23219?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the expression of HCN ion channels leading to changes in &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; function and neuronal excitability are considered to be possible mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis in kinds of human epilepsy. In previous animal studies of febrile seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy, changes in the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 channels at different time points and in different parts of the brain were not consistent, suggesting that transcriptional disorders involving HCNs play a crucial role in the epileptogenic process. Therefore, we aimed to assess the transcriptional regulation of HCN channels in Medial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE‐HS) patients. This study included eight nonhippocampal sclerosis patients and 40 MTLE‐HS patients. The mRNA expression of HCN channels was evaluated by qRT‐PCR, while the protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by Western blotting. The subcellular localization of HCN channels in the hippocampus was explored by immunofluorescence. We demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression of HCN1 and HCN2 are downregulated in controls compared to that in MTLE‐HS patients. In the hippocampal CA1/CA4 subregion and GCL, in addition to a large decrease in neurons, the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 on neuronal cell membranes was also downregulated in MTLE‐HS patients. These findings suggest that the expression of HCN channels are downregulated in MTLE‐HS, which indicates that the decline in HCN channels in the hippocampus during chronic epilepsy in MTLE‐HS patients leads to the downregulation of &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current density and function, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect and increasing neuronal excitability and eventually causing disturbances in the electrical activity of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Evolution of Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Early Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25811?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25811?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the longitudinal profile of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in early Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with healthy controls (HC) and tested baseline CSF biomarkers for prediction of clinical decline in PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐β (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;), total tau (t‐tau) and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 position (p‐tau) were measured using the high‐precision Roche Elecsys® electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in all available CSF samples from longitudinally studied PD (n = 416) and HC (n = 192) followed for up to three years in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Longitudinal CSF and clinical data were analyzed with linear‐mixed effects models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found PD patients had lower CSF t‐tau (median = 157.7 pg/mL,range = 80.9–467.0), p‐tau (median = 13.4 pg/mL,range = 8.0–40.1) and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (median = 846.2 pg/mL,range = 238.8–3707.0) than HC at baseline (CSF t‐tau median = 173.5 pg/mL,range = 82.0–580.8; p‐tau median = 15.4 pg/mL,range = 8.1–73.6; Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; median = 926.5 pg/mL,range = 239.1–3297.0;p &amp;lt; 0.05–0.001) and a moderate‐to‐strong correlation among these biomarkers in both PD and HC (Rho = 0.50–0.97; p &amp;lt; 0.001). 31.5% of PD had pathologically‐low levels of CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; baseline and these PD patients had lower p‐tau levels (median = 10.8 pg/mL, range = 8.0–32.8) compared to 27.7% of HC with pathologically‐low CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (CSF p‐tau median = 12.8 pg/mL, range 8.2–73.6;p &amp;lt; 0.03)&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt; In longitudinal CSF analysis, we found PD had greater decline in CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (mean difference = −41.83 pg/ml; p = 0.03) and CSF p‐tau (mean difference = −0.38 pg/ml; p = 0.03) at year three compared to HC. Baseline CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; values predicted small but measurable decline on cognitive, autonomic and motor function in early PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest baseline CSF AD biomarkers may have prognostic value in early PD and that the dynamic change of these markers, while modest over a three‐year period, suggest biomarker profiles in PD may deviate from healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Palmitoylated Proteins in Dendritic Spine Remodeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00022</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00022</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Activity-responsive changes in the actin cytoskeleton are required for the biogenesis, motility, and remodeling of dendritic spines. These changes are governed by proteins that regulate the polymerization, depolymerization, bundling, and branching of actin filaments. Thus, processes that have been extensively characterized in the context of non-neuronal cell shape change and migration are also critical for learning and memory. In this review article, we highlight actin regulatory proteins that associate, at least transiently, with the dendritic plasma membrane. All of these proteins have been shown, either in directed studies or in high—throughput screens, to undergo palmitoylation, a potentially reversible, and stimulus-dependent cysteine modification. Palmitoylation increases the affinity of peripheral proteins for the membrane bilayer and contributes to their subcellular localization and recruitment to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;In the clinical routine, detection of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) by visual inspection is challenging. Still, information about the presence and location of FCD is highly relevant for prognostication and treatment decisions. Therefore, this study aimed to develop, describe and test a method for the calculation of synthetic anatomies using multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI) data and surface-based analysis, which allows for an improved visualization of FCD.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Quantitative T1-, T2- and PD-maps and conventional clinical datasets of patients with FCD and epilepsy were acquired. Tissue segmentation and delineation of the border between white matter and cortex was performed. In order to detect blurring at this border, a surface-based calculation of the standard deviation of each quantitative parameter (T1, T2, and PD) was performed across the cortex and the neighboring white matter for each cortical vertex. The resulting standard deviations combined with measures of the cortical thickness were used to enhance the signal of conventional FLAIR-datasets. The resulting synthetically enhanced FLAIR-anatomies were compared with conventional MRI-data utilizing regions of interest based analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The synthetically enhanced FLAIR-anatomies showed higher signal levels than conventional FLAIR-data at the FCD sites (p = 0.005). In addition, the enhanced FLAIR-anatomies exhibited higher signal levels at the FCD sites than in the corresponding contralateral regions (p = 0.005). However, false positive findings occurred, so careful comparison with conventional datasets is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Synthetically enhanced FLAIR-anatomies resulting from surface-based multiparametric qMRI-analyses have the potential to improve the visualization of FCD and, accordingly, the treatment of the respective patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by muscle weakness due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Neuroinflammation is known as a prominent pathological feature of ALS. Although neuroinflammation cannot trigger ALS, activated central nervous system (CNS) microglia and astrocytes, proinflammatory periphery monocytes/macrophages and T lymphocytes, and infiltrated monocytes/macrophages and T lymphocytes, as well as the immunoreactive molecules they release, are closely related to disease progression. The crosstalk between the peripheral and CNS immune components mentioned above significantly correlates with survival in patients with ALS. This review provides an update on the role of this crosstalk between the CNS and peripheral immune responses in ALS. Additionally, we discuss changes in the composition of gut microbiota because these can directly or indirectly influence this crosstalk. These recent advances may well provide innovative ways for targeting the molecules associated with this crosstalk and breaking the current treatment impasse in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Non-invasive High Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (hfrTMS) Robustly Activates Molecular Pathways Implicated in Neuronal Growth and Synaptic Plasticity in Select Populations of Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patterns of neuronal activity that induce synaptic plasticity and memory storage activate kinase cascades in neurons that are thought to be part of the mechanism for synaptic modification. One such cascade involves induction of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in neurons due to synaptic activation of AKT/mTOR and via a different pathway, activation of MAP kinase/ERK1/2. Here, we show that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 can also be strongly activated by high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (hfrTMS). HfrTMS was delivered to lightly anesthetized rats using a stimulation protocol that is a standard for inducing LTP in the perforant path in vivo (trains of 8 pulses at 400 Hz repeated at intervals of 1/10 s). Stimulation produced stimulus-locked motor responses but did not elicit behavioral seizures either during or after stimulation. After as little as 10 min of hfrTMS, immunostaining using phospho-specific antibodies for the phosphorylated form of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) revealed robust induction of rpS6 phosphorylation in large numbers of neurons in the cortex, especially the piriform cortex, and also in thalamic relay nuclei. Quantification revealed that the extent of the increased immunostaining depended on the number of trains and stimulus intensity. Of note, immunostaining for the immediate early genes Arc and c-fos revealed strong induction of IEG expression in many of the same populations of neurons throughout the cortex, but not the thalamus. These results indicate that hfrTMS can robustly activate molecular pathways critical for plasticity, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of TMS on recovery following brain and spinal cord injury and symptom amelioration in human psychiatric disorders. These molecular processes may be a useful surrogate marker to allow optimization of TMS parameters for maximal therapeutic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Synchrony Between Default-Mode and Sensorimotor Networks Facilitates Motor Function in Stroke Rehabilitation: A Pilot fMRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is the most common cause of complex disability in Taiwan. After stroke onset, persistent physical practice or exercise in the rehabilitation procedure reorganizes neural assembly for reducing motor deficits, known as neuroplasticity. Neuroimaging literature showed rehabilitative effects specific to the brain networks of the sensorimotor network (SMN) and default-mode network (DMN). However, whether between-network interactions facilitate the neuroplasticity after stroke rehabilitation remains a mystery. Therefore, we conducted the longitudinal assessment protocol of stroke rehabilitation, including three types of clinical evaluations and two types of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques (resting state and grasp task). Twelve chronic stroke patients completed the rehabilitation protocol for at least 24 h and finished the three-time assessments: before, after rehabilitation, and 1 month after the cessation of rehabilitation. For comparison, age-matched normal controls (NC) underwent the same fMRI evaluation once without repeated measure. Increasing scores of the Fugl–Meyer assessment (FMA) and upper extremity performance test reflected the enhanced motor performances after the stroke rehabilitation process. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results showed that the connections between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and iM1 were persistently enhanced in contrast to the pre-rehabilitation condition. The interactions between PCC and SMN were positively associated with motor performances. The enhanced cross-network connectivity facilitates the motor recovery after stroke rehabilitation, but the cross-network interaction was low before the rehabilitation process, similar to the level of NCs. Our findings suggested that cross-network connectivity plays a facilitatory role following the stroke rehabilitation, which can serve as a neurorehabilitative biomarker for future intervention evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Fully Automated Method for Segmenting Arteries and Quantifying Vessel Radii on Magnetic Resonance Angiography Images of Varying Projection Thickness</title>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Precise quantification of cerebral arteries can help with differentiation and prognostication of cerebrovascular disease. Existing image processing and segmentation algorithms for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are limited to the analysis of either 2D maximum intensity projection images or the entire 3D volume. The goal of this study was to develop a fully automated, hybrid 2D-3D method for robust segmentation of arteries and accurate quantification of vessel radii using MRA at varying projection thicknesses.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A novel algorithm that employs an adaptive Frangi filter for segmentation of vessels followed by estimation of vessel radii is presented. The method was evaluated on MRA datasets and corresponding manual segmentations from three healthy subjects for various projection thicknesses. In addition, the vessel metrics were computed in four additional subjects. Three synthetically generated angiographic datasets resembling brain vasculature were also evaluated under different noise levels. Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard Index, F-score, and concordance correlation coefficient were used to measure the segmentation accuracy of manual versus automatic segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our new adaptive filter rendered accurate representations of vessels, maintained accurate vessel radii, and corresponded better to manual segmentation at different projection thicknesses than prior methods. Validation with synthetic datasets under low contrast and noisy conditions revealed accurate quantification of vessels without distortions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated a method for automatic segmentation of vascular trees and the subsequent generation of a vessel radii map. This novel technique can be applied to analyze arterial structures in healthy and diseased populations and improve the characterization of vascular integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 Phosphorylation, More Than an Epiphenomenon</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00527</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are linked to autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), and genetic variations at the LRRK2 locus are associated with an increased risk for sporadic PD. This gene encodes a kinase that is physiologically multiphosphorylated, including clusters of both heterologous phosphorylation and autophosphorylation sites. Several pieces of evidence indicate that LRRK2's phosphorylation is important for its pathological and physiological functioning. These include a reduced LRRK2 heterologous phosphorylation in PD brains or after pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity as well as the appearance of subcellular LRRK2 accumulations when this protein is dephosphorylated at heterologous phosphosites. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms governing LRRK2 phosphorylation levels and the cellular consequences of changes in LRRK2 phosphorylation remain incompletely understood. In this review, we present current knowledge on LRRK2 phosphorylation, LRRK2 phosphoregulation, and how LRRK2 phosphorylation changes affect cellular processes that may ultimately be linked to PD mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mfsd2a Reverses Spatial Learning and Memory Impairment Caused by Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion via Protection of the Blood–Brain Barrier</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) can lead to cognitive impairment. Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (Mfsd2a) is a newly discovered protein that is essential for maintaining BBB integrity. However, the role of Mfsd2a in vascular cognitive impairment has not been explored yet. In this study, a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was established by producing permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) in rats. We found that after the 2VO procedure, the rats exhibited cognitive impairment, showed increased BBB leakage within the hippocampus, and had reduced expression of the Mfsd2a protein. The overexpression of Mfsd2a in the rat hippocampus reversed these changes. Further investigations using transmission electron microscopy revealed a significantly increased rate of vesicular transcytosis in the BBB of the hippocampus of the CCH rats; the rate reduced after overexpression of Mfsd2a. Moreover, Mfsd2a overexpression did not cause changes in the expression of tight junction-associated proteins and in the ultrastructures of the tight junctions. In conclusion, Mfsd2a attenuated BBB damage and ameliorated cognitive impairment in CCH rats, and its protective effect on the BBB was achieved via inhibition of vesicular transcytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Signatures of Gender Differences in Interpersonal Trust</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00225</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trust plays a critical role in nearly every aspect of social life. Parental investment theory and social role theory predict that women trust less than men due to a higher sensitivity to risk and betrayal, while men trust more than women to maximize resources and to signal their willingness to lose something. However, the underlying neuropsychological underpinnings for this gender difference are still obscure. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural signatures of gender differences in trust by simultaneously scanning 11 male and 11 female same-gender, fixed dyads who played a multi-round binary trust game with varying levels of payoff (low/moderate/high) as an indicator of social risk. Our results showed that men trusted more than women and payoff level moderated the effect of gender on trust. While men trusted the same at all payoff levels, women trusted less with higher payoff levels. This pattern was supported by our neuroimaging finding: men showed a higher activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and right precuneus than women, indicating that men exert more effort to inhibit the information of payoff levels and to use self-referencing to infer the strategies of partners with the goal of maximizing profit. Furthermore, men showed equivalent activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex across payoff levels, whereas women showed a decreased activation with increasing payoff level – indicating decreased group bonding with higher risk in women. In conclusion, our results imply that women are more sensitive to social risk while trusting, which has implications for financial interactions, interpersonal relationships, and social involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation Over the Suprahyoid Muscles Motor Cortex Facilitates Increased Degree Centrality in Healthy Subjects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a variant of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), can potentially benefit the treatment of swallowing disorders. However, the after-effects of TBS on the swallowing motor cortex remain uncertain. The newly developed graph-based analysis of the centrality approach has been increasingly used to explore brain networks. The purpose of this study was to identify degree centrality (DC) alterations in the brain network after different TBS protocols were performed over the suprahyoid muscles motor cortex in healthy subjects. A total of 40 right-handed healthy subjects (mean age: 23.73 ± 2.57 years, range: 21–30, 20 females) were included in this study and randomly assigned to two groups, including the continuous TBS (cTBS) group and the intermittent TBS (iTBS) group. All of the subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning before and after TBS implementation. Compared to the baseline, cTBS resulted in increased DC values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In the iTBS group, decreased DC was observed in the left cerebellum and left medial frontal gyrus; However, increased DC was observed in several brain areas including the right superior temporal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right postcentral gyri and left paracentral lobule (P &amp;lt; 0.01). These results indicated that cTBS mainly results in increasing DC in the ipsilateral. However, iTBS is capable of facilitating the excitability of the swallowing motor cortex and increasing the connectivity of multiple brain regions, including the bilateral sensorimotor network, and might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of swallowing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining how neurons transform synaptic input and encode information in action potential (AP) firing output is required for understanding dendritic integration, neural transforms and encoding. Limitations in the speed of imaging 3D volumes of brain encompassing complex dendritic arbors in vivo using conventional galvanometer mirror-based laser-scanning microscopy has hampered fully capturing fluorescent sensors of activity throughout an individual neuron's entire complement of synaptic inputs and somatic APs. To address this problem, we have developed a two-photon microscope that achieves high-speed scanning by employing inertia-free acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) for laser beam positioning, enabling random-access sampling of hundreds to thousands of points-of-interest restricted to a predetermined neuronal structure, avoiding wasted scanning of surrounding extracellular tissue. This system is capable of comprehensive imaging of the activity of single neurons within the intact and awake vertebrate brain. Here, we demonstrate imaging of tectal neurons within the brains of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles labeled using single-cell electroporation for expression of a red space-filling fluorophore to determine dendritic arbor morphology, and either the calcium sensor jGCaMP7s or the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR as indicators of neural activity. Using discrete, point-of-interest scanning we achieve sampling rates of 3 Hz for saturation sampling of entire arbors at 2 μm resolution, 6 Hz for sequentially sampling 3 volumes encompassing the dendritic arbor and soma, and 200–250 Hz for scanning individual planes through the dendritic arbor. This system allows investigations of sensory-evoked information input-output relationships of neurons within the intact and awake brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Computational Modeling of Inhibitory Transsynaptic Signaling in Hippocampal and Cortical Neurons Expressing Intrabodies Against Gephyrin</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABAergic transmission regulates neuronal excitability, dendritic integration of synaptic signals and oscillatory activity, thought to be involved in high cognitive functions. By anchoring synaptic receptors just opposite to release sites, the scaffold protein gephyrin plays a key role in these tasks. In addition, by regulating GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor trafficking, gephyrin contributes to maintain, at the network level, an appropriate balance between Excitation (E) and Inhibition (I), crucial for information processing. An E/I imbalance leads to neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. In this article, we exploit a previously published computational method to fit spontaneous synaptic events, using a simplified model of the subcellular pathways involving gephyrin at inhibitory synapses. The model was used to analyze experimental data recorded under different conditions, with the main goal to gain insights on the possible consequences of gephyrin block on IPSCs. The same approach can be useful, in general, to analyze experiments designed to block a single protein. The results suggested possible ways to correlate the changes observed in the amplitude and time course of individual events recorded after different experimental protocols with the changes that may occur in the main subcellular pathways involved in gephyrin-dependent transsynaptic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Synaptic Scaling Literature: A Systematic Review of Methodologies and Quality of Reporting</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The maintenance of the excitability of neurons and circuits is a fundamental process for healthy brain functions. One of the main homeostatic mechanisms responsible for such regulation is synaptic scaling. While this type of plasticity is well-characterized through a robust body of literature, there are no systematic evaluations of the methodological and reporting features from these studies. Our review yielded 168 articles directly investigating synaptic scaling mechanisms, which display relatively high impact, with a median impact factor of 7.76 for the publishing journals. Our methodological analysis identified that 86% of the articles made use of inhibitory interventions to induce synaptic scaling, while only 41% of those studies contain excitatory manipulations. To verify the effects of synaptic scaling, the most assessed outcome was miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) recordings, performed in 71% of the articles. We could also observe that the field is mostly focused on mechanistic studies of the synaptic scaling pathways (70%), rather than the interaction with other types of plasticity, such as Hebbian processes (4%). We found that more than half of the articles failed to describe simple features, such as regulatory compliance statements, ethics committee approval, or statements of conflict of interests. In light of these results, we discuss the strengths and pitfalls existing in synaptic scaling literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have suggested the neuroinvasive potential of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Notably, neuroinvasiveness might be involved in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some studies have demonstrated that synapse-connected routes may enable coronaviruses to access the central nervous system (CNS). However, evidence related to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS, its direct impact on the CNS, and the contribution to symptoms suffered, remain sparse. Here, we review the current literature that indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the nervous system. We also describe the neural circuits that are potentially affected by the virus and their possible role in the progress of COVID-19. In addition, we propose several strategies to understand, diagnose, and treat the neurological symptoms of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aberrant Brain Spontaneous Activity and Synchronization in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to investigate the aberration of brain spontaneous activity and synchronization in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients homozygous for the apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε3 allele. In the APOE-ε3 homozygotes, 37 T2DM patients and 37 well-matched healthy controls (HC) were included to acquire blood sample measurements, neuropsychological tests, and brain functional MRI data. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) analysis was conducted to identify the brain areas with abnormal spontaneous activity. Then, the identified brain areas were taken as seeds to compute their functional connectivity (FC) with other brain regions. The two-sample t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test were applied to reveal significant differences in acquired measurements between the two groups. The potential correlations among the three types of measurements were explored using partial correlation analysis in the T2DM group. The T2DM group had elevated glycemic levels and scored lower on the cognitive assessment but higher on the anxiety and depression tests (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The T2DM group exhibited higher ALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus, and the left middle occipital gyrus had lower FC with the left caudate nucleus and the left inferior parietal gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant correlations were observed. T2DM patients homozygous for the APOE-ε3 allele exhibited aberrant brain spontaneous activity and synchronization in brain regions associated with vision-related information processing, executive function, and negative emotions. The findings may update our understanding of the mechanisms of brain dysfunction in T2DM patients in a neuroimaging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) exerts neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Conventional stimulation techniques entail limited stimulation time and restricted movement of animals, warranting the need for optimizing the SCS regimen to address the progressive nature of the disease and to improve its clinical translation to PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the limitations of conventional stimulation, we now investigated the effects of continuous SCS in freely moving parkinsonian rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We developed a small device that could deliver continuous SCS. At the start of the experiment, thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats received the dopamine (DA)-depleting neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, into the right striatum. The SCS device was fixed below the shoulder area of the back of the animal, and a line from this device was passed under the skin to an electrode that was then implanted epidurally over the dorsal column. The rats were divided into three groups: control, 8-h stimulation, and 24-h stimulation, and behaviorally tested then euthanized for immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The 8- and 24-h stimulation groups displayed significant behavioral improvement compared to the control group. Both SCS-stimulated groups exhibited significantly preserved tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers and neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), respectively, compared to the control group. Notably, the 24-h stimulation group showed significantly pronounced preservation of the striatal TH-positive fibers compared to the 8-h stimulation group. Moreover, the 24-h group demonstrated significantly reduced number of microglia in the striatum and SNc and increased laminin-positive area of the cerebral cortex compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated the behavioral and histological benefits of continuous SCS in a time-dependent manner in freely moving PD animals, possibly mediated by anti-inflammatory and angiogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: SMR/Theta Neurofeedback Training Improves Cognitive Performance and EEG Activity in Elderly With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00147</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00147</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neurofeedback (NF) training, as a method of self-regulation of brain activity, may be beneficial in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this pilot study, we investigated whether a sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training could improve cognitive performance and brain electrical activity in elderly patients with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty elderly patients with MCI were assigned to 20 consecutive sessions of sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training, during 10 weeks, on a basis of two sessions each week. Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires, as well as electroencephalogram (EEG), were performed and compared between baseline (T0), after the last NF training session at 10 weeks (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that from baseline to post-intervention, participants showed significant improvement in the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCa, F = 4.78; p = 0.012), the delayed recall of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT, F = 3.675; p = 0.032), the Forward digit span (F = 13.82; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), the Anxiety Goldberg Scale (F = 4.54; p = 0.015), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score–Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; F = 24.75; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and the Mac Nair score (F = 4.47; p = 0.016). EEG theta power (F = 4.44; p = 0.016) and alpha power (F = 3.84; p = 0.027) during eyes-closed resting-state significantly increased after the NF training and showed sustained improvement at a 1-month follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results suggest that NF training could be effective to reduce cognitive deficits in elderly patients with MCI and improve their EEG activity. If these findings are confirmed by randomized controlled studies with larger samples of patients, NF could be seen as a useful non-invasive, non-pharmacological tool for preventing further decline, rehabilitation of cognitive function in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: This pilot study was a preliminary step before the trial registered in www.ClinicalTrials.gov, under the number of NCT03526692.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased Noradrenaline as an Additional Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker in PSP-Like Parkinsonism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00126</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Academic centers utilize sequential clinical and neuroimaging assessments, including morphometric ratios, to obtain an unequivocal diagnosis of the non-synucleinopathic forms of Parkinsonism, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), however, a 1–2 year follow-up is required. The on-going long-lasting trials using anti-tau antibodies for PSP patients might therefore be biased by the incorrect enrollment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients manifesting early axial signs. This perspective study aimed at achieving two major goals: first, to summarize the established biomarker candidates found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in probable PSP patients, including low p-tau and altered neurofilaments. Second, we share our recent data, from CSF samples of well-selected PSP subjects, attributable to both main variants (and revisited in light of MDS criteria), who were followed for 1 year before and 2 years after lumbar puncture. We found a significantly high level of noradrenaline (NE) in these patients, similar to controls, when compared to PD patients. In contrast, CSF samples, in PD, showed a significant reduction in CSF NE and its major metabolite, which confirmed that PD is a multi-system disease involving several endogenous pathways. The NE axis impairments were prominent in PSP featuring worse NPI. It might represent a counterpart to the early and peculiar psycho-pathological profiles that are observed in tauopathies. In conclusion, we highlight that CSF biomarkers, which are easy to collect, can provide rapid insights as diagnostic tools. Early alterations in endogenous NE machinery in atypical Parkinsonism may represent a specific risk trait in forms characterized by a worse prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>CaV2 channels provide Ca2+ for triggering neurotransmitter release at central synapses. Held et al. remove all CaV2s and Ca2+ entry and find that synaptic protein nano-assemblies persist and synapse ultrastructure is unimpaired despite abolishing synaptic transmission. Rescue experiments establish that CaV2 C-termini are important for channel anchoring at active zones.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dynamic interactions of influenza viruses in Hong Kong during 1998-2018</title>

Influenza epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality every year worldwide. Currently, two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and type B viruses co-circulate in humans and infection with one type/subtype could provide cross-protection against the others. However, it remains unclear how such ecologic competition via cross-immunity and antigenic mutations that allow immune escape impact influenza epidemic dynamics at the population level. Here we develop a comprehensive model-inference system and apply it to study the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the three influenza types/subtypes in Hong Kong, a city of global public health significance for influenza epidemic and pandemic control. Utilizing long-term influenza surveillance data since 1998, we are able to estimate the strength of cross-immunity between each virus-pairs, the timing and frequency of punctuated changes in population immunity in response to antigenic mutations in influenza viruses, and key epidemiological parameters over the last 20 years including the 2009 pandemic. We find evidence of cross-immunity in all types/subtypes, with strongest cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2). Our results also suggest that A(H3N2) may undergo antigenic mutations in both summers and winters and thus monitoring the virus in both seasons may be important for vaccine development. Overall, our study reveals intricate epidemiological interactions and underscores the importance of simultaneous monitoring of population immunity, incidence rates, and viral genetic and antigenic changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ubSc_LS7KRU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: XDream: Finding preferred stimuli for visual neurons using generative networks and gradient-free optimization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Will Xiao, Gabriel Kreiman&lt;/p&gt;

A longstanding question in sensory neuroscience is what types of stimuli drive neurons to fire. The characterization of effective stimuli has traditionally been based on a combination of intuition, insights from previous studies, and luck. A new method termed XDream (EXtending DeepDream with real-time evolution for activation maximization) combined a generative neural network and a genetic algorithm in a closed loop to create strong stimuli for neurons in the macaque visual cortex. Here we extensively and systematically evaluate the performance of XDream. We use ConvNet units as &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; models of neurons, enabling experiments that would be prohibitive with biological neurons. We evaluated how the method compares to brute-force search, and how well the method generalizes to different neurons and processing stages. We also explored design and parameter choices. XDream can efficiently find preferred features for visual units without any prior knowledge about them. XDream extrapolates to different layers, architectures, and developmental regimes, performing better than brute-force search, and often better than exhaustive sampling of &amp;gt;1 million images. Furthermore, XDream is robust to choices of multiple image generators, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameters, suggesting that its performance is locally near-optimal. Lastly, we found no significant advantage to problem-specific parameter tuning. These results establish expectations and provide practical recommendations for using XDream to investigate neural coding in biological preparations. Overall, XDream is an efficient, general, and robust algorithm for uncovering neuronal tuning preferences using a vast and diverse stimulus space. XDream is implemented in Python, released under the MIT License, and works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uIdW2-WaCkg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Interactive data visualization is imperative in the biological sciences. The development of independent layers of interactivity has been in pursuit in the visualization community. We developed bigPint, a data visualization package available on Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bigPint.html). Our software introduces new visualization technology that enables independent layers of interactivity using Plotly in R, which aids in the exploration of large biological datasets. The bigPint package presents modernized versions of scatterplot matrices, volcano plots, and litre plots through the implementation of layered interactivity. These graphics have detected normalization issues, differential expression designation problems, and common analysis errors in public RNA-sequencing datasets. Researchers can apply bigPint graphics to their data by following recommended pipelines written in reproducible code in the user manual. In this paper, we explain how we achieved the independent layers of interactivity that are behind bigPint graphics. Pseudocode and source code are provided. Computational scientists can leverage our open-source code to expand upon our layered interactive technology and/or apply it in new ways toward other computational biology tasks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cykp_rbj-8c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Kilohertz waveforms optimized to produce closed-state Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel inactivation eliminate onset response in nerve conduction block</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Guosheng Yi, Warren M. Grill&lt;/p&gt;

The delivery of kilohertz frequency alternating current (KHFAC) generates rapid, controlled, and reversible conduction block in motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves, but causes transient activation of action potentials at the onset of the blocking current. We implemented a novel engineering optimization approach to design blocking waveforms that eliminated the onset response by moving voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGSCs) to closed-state inactivation (CSI) without first opening. We used computational models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to design a charge-balanced 10 kHz biphasic current waveform that produced conduction block without onset firing in peripheral axons at specific locations and with specific diameters. The results indicate that it is possible to achieve onset-free KHFAC nerve block by causing CSI of VGSCs. Our novel approach for designing blocking waveforms and the resulting waveform may have utility in clinical applications of conduction block of peripheral nerve hyperactivity, for example in pain and spasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xd2g5jk0DrE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolism underpins the pathogenic strategy of the causative agent of TB, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb), and therefore metabolic pathways have recently re-emerged as attractive drug targets. A powerful approach to study Mtb metabolism as a whole, rather than just individual enzymatic components, is to use a systems biology framework, such as a Genome-Scale Metabolic Network (GSMN) that allows the dynamic interactions of all the components of metabolism to be interrogated together. Several GSMNs networks have been constructed for Mtb and used to study the complex relationship between the Mtb genotype and its phenotype. However, the utility of this approach is hampered by the existence of multiple models, each with varying properties and performances. Here we systematically evaluate eight recently published metabolic models of Mtb-H37Rv to facilitate model choice. The best performing models, sMtb2018 and iEK1011, were refined and improved for use in future studies by the TB research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aWK9BLHMFas&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Vision therapy: ocular motor training in mild traumatic brain injury</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25820?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its efficacy. While the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Drug‐responsive inhomogeneous cortical modulation by direct current stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25822?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25822?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long‐term depression (LTD)‐like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS‐LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;, whether DCS‐LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug‐DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS‐mediated changes in cortical excitability were mesured &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)‐seizure model. Contributions of NMDA‐type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS‐mediated plasticity was tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D‐AP5).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS reliably induced DCS‐LTD in superficial cortical layers, while a long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like enhancement (DCS‐LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer‐specific increase of phospho‐S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar non‐uniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; and in S1 of alert mice &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;. Application of mematine/D‐AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS‐LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS‐LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA‐induced seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mapping the insula with stereo‐electroencephalography: The emergence of semiology in insula lobe seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25817?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25817?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insula epilepsy is rare and can be evaluated effectively by Stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG). Many previous studies of insulo‐opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed intra‐insular dynamics and extra‐insular propagation in twelve patients with “pure” insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster and principal component analysis of semiological features was performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, intrainsular and extrainsular propagation was computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous, the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred, contralateral insular spread was very early. Whilst the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extra‐insular propagation was early and related to emergence of majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principle component separated anterior insula manifestations including early hypermotor signs, early recovery and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features and sensorimotor aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous, extra‐insula propagation occurs early accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling ‘pure insula’ epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut Microbiome Signatures of Risk and Prodromal Markers of Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25788?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function, and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α‐/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND (Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among risk and prodromal markers, physical activity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical activity, sex, constipation, possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical activity showed an interaction effect. Among other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Physical inactivity and constipation were highest in individuals with the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes &lt;/i&gt;‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the &lt;i&gt;Prevotella &lt;/i&gt;‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical activity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history, and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Adenosine A1 Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Depression in the Developing Hippocampal Area CA2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00021</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00021</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Immunolabeling for adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) is high in hippocampal area CA2 in adult rats, and the potentiating effects of caffeine or other A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-selective antagonists on synaptic responses are particularly robust at Schaffer collateral synapses in CA2. Interestingly, the pronounced staining for A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in CA2 is not apparent until rats are 4 weeks old, suggesting that developmental changes other than receptor distribution underlie the sensitivity of CA2 synapses to A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonists in young animals. To evaluate the role of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated postsynaptic signals at these synapses, we tested whether A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonists regulate synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral inputs to CA2 and CA1. We found that the selective A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist CCPA caused a lasting depression of synaptic responses in both CA2 and CA1 neurons in slices obtained from juvenile rats (P14), but that the effect was observed only in CA2 in slices prepared from adult animals (~P70). Interestingly, blocking phosphodiesterase activity with rolipram inhibited the CCPA-induced depression in CA1, but not in CA2, indicative of robust phosphodiesterase activity in CA1 neurons. Likewise, synaptic responses in CA2 and CA1 differed in their sensitivity to the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, in that it increased synaptic transmission in CA2, but had little effect in CA1. These findings suggest that the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated synaptic depression tracks the postnatal development of immunolabeling for A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and that the enhanced sensitivity to antagonists in CA2 at young ages is likely due to robust adenylyl cyclase activity and weak phosphodiesterase activity rather than to enrichment of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Redistribution of inhibitory force feedback between a long toe flexor and the major ankle extensor muscles following spinal cord injury&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6bce8381-5195-4567-8af7-a9bd9a8f8cd3/jnr24630-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golgi tendon organ pathways contribute to coordination of limb extensors during motor tasks including locomotion. Normally, these inhibitory force feedback pathways are flexibly weighted. We show that following spinal cord injury, force feedback is permanently reorganized. Balance is lost and biased inhibition emerges from toe flexors onto ankle extensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory pathways from Golgi tendon organs project widely between muscles crossing different joints and axes of rotation. Evidence suggests that the strength and distribution of this intermuscular inhibition is dependent on motor task and corresponding signals from the brainstem. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether this sensory network is altered after spinal cord hemisection as a potential explanation for motor deficits observed after spinal cord injury (SCI). Force feedback was assessed between the long toe flexor and ankle plantarflexor (flexor hallucis longus), and the three major ankle extensors, (combined gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles) in the hind limbs of unanesthetized, decerebrate, female cats. Data were collected from animals with intact spinal cords (control) and lateral spinal hemisections (LSHs) including chronic LSH (4–20 weeks), subchronic LSH (2 weeks), and acute LSH. Muscles were stretched individually and in pairwise combinations to measure intermuscular feedback between the toe flexor and each of the ankle extensors. In control animals, three patterns were observed (balanced inhibition between toe flexor and ankle extensors, stronger inhibition from toe flexor to ankle extensor, and vice versa). Following spinal hemisection, only strong inhibition from toe flexors onto ankle extensors was observed independent of survival time. The results suggest immediate and permanent reorganization of force feedback in the injured spinal cord. The altered strength and distribution of force feedback after SCI may be an important future target for rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Role of 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3 receptors in serotonergic activation of sensory neurons in relation to itch and pain behavior in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/655b86f5-a9ee-4cf5-9773-1c05b065ca34/jnr24633-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. We focused on the identification of the signaling pathways involved in the activation of rat primary afferent neurons by 5‐HT and their involvement in itch and pain sensing. Transient responses evoked by 5‐HT are mediated by ionotropic 5‐HT3 receptors. Sustained responses to 5‐HT require activation of 5‐HT1A receptors coupled to Gi/o, leading to a decrease in membrane conductance, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels and calcium entry. Both responses appear to be involved in triggering serotonergic itch in both male and female Wistar rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. The serotonergic receptors expressed by primary afferent neurons involved in these sensory functions are not fully identified and appear to be to a large extent species dependent. Moreover, the mechanisms through which 5‐HT receptor activation is coupled to changes in neuronal excitability have not been completely revealed. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; (calcium and voltage imaging and patch‐clamp) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; behavioral methods, we used both male and female Wistar rats to provide evidence for the involvement of two 5‐HT receptor subtypes, 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3, in mediating the sustained and transient effects, respectively, of 5‐HT on rat primary afferent neurons involved in pain and itch processing. In addition, our results are consistent with a model in which sustained serotonergic responses triggered via the 5‐HT1A receptor are due to closure of background potassium channels, followed by membrane depolarization and action potentials, during which the activation of voltage‐gated calcium channels leads to calcium entry. Our results may provide a better understanding of mammalian serotonergic itch signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex differences in the brains of capuchin monkeys (Sapajus [Cebus] apella)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a3d4c737-172b-4626-b874-c2fb5c61559e/cne24950-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voxel‐based morphometry analysis of 20 capuchin T1‐magnetic resonance imaging scans identified several sex differences in gray matter morphology. Male capuchins showed enlargement in a region of the posterior hypothalamus, possibly including the mammillary bodies, paraventricular nucleus, and/or lateral hypothalamus. Female capuchins showed enlargement in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, likely Crus II, and in the left occipitotemporal cortex, possibly including V2, V3, V4, TEO, and/or MT. These female‐enlarged regions have shown experience‐dependent plasticity in prior primate studies, and tractography indicated that they connect with a distributed network of perceptual and association regions. We postulate that capuchin brains, like human brains and in contrast to rodent brains, may show sex differences related to differential lifetime experience on top of more innate sex differences.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our data set, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely nonoverlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Suppression of active phase voluntary wheel running in male rats by unilateral chronic constriction injury: Enduring therapeutic effects of a brief treatment of morphine combined with TLR4 or P2X7 antagonists</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Suppression of active phase voluntary wheel running in male rats by unilateral chronic constriction injury: Enduring therapeutic effects of a brief treatment of morphine combined with TLR4 or P2X7 antagonists&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e432c985-ce9b-4864-ad26-78bb225a72ce/jnr24645-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voluntary wheel running was assessed after peripheral nerve injury. Active phase running distance and speed are also measured in response to morphine alone, or in combination with antagonists of either P2X7R or TLR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present series of studies examine the impact of systemically administered therapeutics on peripheral nerve injury (males; unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury [CCI])‐induced suppression of voluntary wheel running, across weeks after dosing cessation. Following CCI, active phase running distance and speed are suppressed throughout the 7‐week observation period. A brief course of morphine, however, increased active phase running distance and speed throughout this same period, an effect apparent only in sham rats. For CCI rats, systemic co‐administration of morphine with antagonists of either P2X7 (A438079) or TLR4 ((+)‐naloxone) (receptors critical to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and consequent inflammatory cascades) returned running behavior of CCI rats to that of shams through 5+ weeks after dosing ceased. This is a striking difference in effect compared to our prior CCI allodynia results using systemic morphine plus intrathecal delivery of these same antagonists, wherein a sustained albeit partial suppression of neuropathic pain was observed. This may point to actions of the systemic drugs at multiple sites along the neuraxis, modulating injury‐induced, inflammasome‐mediated effects at the injured sciatic nerve and/or dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and potentially higher levels. Given that our data to date point to morphine amplifying neuroinflammatory processes put into motion by nerve injury, it is intriguing to speculate that co‐administration of TLR4 and/or P2X7 antagonists can intervene in these inflammatory processes in a beneficial way. That is, that systemic administration of such compounds may suppress inflammatory damage at multiple sites, rapidly and persistently returning neuropathic animals to sham levels of response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurodiagnostic criteria of Leigh syndrome have not yet been clearly redefined based on the expanding of molecular etiologies. We aimed to analyze 20 years of clinical, genetic, and magnetic resonance studies from our Leigh syndrome cohort to provide a detailed description of central nervous system lesions in Leigh syndrome and their biological evolution in view of their genetic and clinical findings. Our study adds new neurodiagnostic insights to the current knowledge of Leigh syndrome, including association with overlapping syndromes, and the correlation of pathogenic genetic variants with neuroimaging phenotypes.

	<title>Hippocampus: Tonic GABA‐activated synaptic and extrasynaptic currents in dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons along the mouse hippocampal dorsoventral axis</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure in the brain and is widely studied for its role in memory and learning, in particular, spacial memory and emotional responses. It was thought to be a homogenous structure but emerging evidence shows differentiation along the dorsoventral axis and even microdomains for functional and cellular markers. We have examined in two cell‐types of the hippocampal projection neurons, the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, if the GABA‐activated tonic current density varied between the dorsal (septal) and the ventral (temporal) poles of the male mouse hippocampus. Tonic synaptic currents, arising from spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSC), and extrasynaptic tonic currents were evaluated. The results revealed different levels of sIPSC but not mIPSC density between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurons for both the DG granule cells and the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The extrasynaptic tonic current density was larger in the DG granule cells as compared to the CA3 pyramidal neurons but did not vary between the dorsal and ventral regions. IPSC bursting was observed in both cell‐types in the ventral hippocampus but was more common in the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Only in the dorsal DG granule cells was the level of the sIPSC and mIPSC density similar. The results indicate that the tonic GABAergic inhibition is particularly strong in the ventral hippocampal DG granule cells and enhanced in the dorsal as compared to the ventral hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients who received EEGs to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had EEGs that showed Periodic Discharges (PD) consisting of high amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity. These findings may suggest CNS injury potentially related to COVID‐19 in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A recent paper by Carter et al. identifies a novel organelle, the ribosome-associated vesicle (RAV), that might serve as a portable, local factory for producing proteins destined for the secretory pathway. The appearance of RAVs in dendrites suggests they may serve to generate membrane and secreted proteins in distal processes.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Anterior cingulate cortex: A brain system necessary for learning to reward others?</title>

Helping a friend move house, donating to charity, volunteering assistance during a crisis. Humans and other species alike regularly undertake prosocial behaviors—actions that benefit others without necessarily helping ourselves. But how does the brain learn what acts are prosocial? Basile and colleagues show that removal of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) prevents monkeys from learning what actions are prosocial but does not stop them carrying out previously learned prosocial behaviors. This highlights that the ability to learn what actions are prosocial and choosing to perform helpful acts may be distinct cognitive processes, with only the former depending on ACC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZkflowchtXg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The anterior cingulate cortex is necessary for forming prosocial preferences from vicarious reinforcement in monkeys</title>

A key feature of most social relationships is that we like seeing good things happen to others. Research has implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in attaching value to social outcomes. For example, single neurons in macaque ACC selectively code reward delivery to the self, a partner, both monkeys, or neither monkey. Here, we assessed whether the ACC’s contribution to social cognition is causal by testing rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) on a vicarious reinforcement task before and after they sustained ACC lesions. Prior to surgery, actors learned that 3 different visual cues mapped onto 3 distinct reward outcomes: to self (“Self”), to the other monkey (“Other”), or to neither monkey (“Neither”). On each trial, actors saw a cue that predicted one of the 3 juice offers and could accept the offer by making a saccade to a peripheral target or reject the offer by breaking fixation. Preoperatively, all 6 actors displayed prosocial preferences, indicated by their greater tendency to give reward to Other relative to Neither. Half then received selective, bilateral, excitotoxic lesions of the ACC, and the other half served as unoperated controls. After surgery, all monkeys retained the social preferences they had demonstrated with the preoperatively learned cues, but this preference was reduced in the monkeys with ACC lesions. Critically, none of the monkeys in the ACC lesion group acquired social preferences with a new set of cues introduced after surgery. These data indicate that the primate ACC is necessary for acquisition of prosocial preferences from vicarious reinforcement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3igHUMWRxWg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Ciliary melanin‐concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is widely distributed in the murine CNS in a sex‐independent manner</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ciliary melanin‐concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is widely distributed in the murine CNS in a sex‐independent manner&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b7a204ba-6ff7-40a0-ae87-fe7db0de4e3c/jnr24651-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report the distribution of a receptor found in primary cilia, describing an unprecedent wide distribution in the nervous system, differences between rodent species, and a lack of differences between males and females. Our results suggest melanin‐concentrating hormone may be used to target cilia in a large number of areas of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) is a ubiquitous vertebrate neuropeptide predominantly synthesized by neurons of the diencephalon that can act through two G protein‐coupled receptors, called MCHR1 and MCHR2. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Mchr1 &lt;/i&gt; has been investigated in both rats and mice, but its synthesis remains poorly described. After identifying an antibody that detects MCHR1 with high specificity, we employed immunohistochemistry to map the distribution of MCHR1 in the CNS of rats and mice. Multiple neurochemical markers were also employed to characterize some of the neuronal populations that synthesize MCHR1. Our results show that MCHR1 is abundantly found in a subcellular structure called the primary &lt;i&gt;cilium &lt;/i&gt;, which has been associated, among other functions, with the detection of free neurochemical messengers present in the extracellular space. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in a wide range of areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortical mantle, &lt;i&gt;striatum &lt;/i&gt;, hippocampal formation, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, midbrain areas, and in the spinal cord. No differences were observed between male and female mice, and interspecies differences were found in the caudate‐putamen nucleus and the subgranular zone. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in close association with several neurochemical markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase, calretinin, kisspeptin, estrogen receptor, oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin‐releasing factor. Given the role of neuronal primary &lt;i&gt;cilia &lt;/i&gt; in sensing free neurochemical messengers in the extracellular fluid, the widespread distribution of ciliary MCHR1, and the diverse neurochemical populations who synthesize MCHR1, our data indicate that nonsynaptic communication plays a prominent role in the normal function of the MCH system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Caudate nuclei volume alterations and cognition and mood dysfunctions in adolescents with single ventricle heart disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/645d37fb-a21b-4030-a702-8435937a7408/jnr24667-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) adolescents accompany smaller caudate nuclei volumes, localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal sites, regions that have projections to memory and mood regulatory areas. These data suggest that SVHD adolescents have brain structural basis for deficient functions in the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) exhibit mood and cognitive deficits, which may result from injury to the basal ganglia structures, including the caudate nuclei. However, the integrity of the caudate in SVHD adolescents is unclear. Our aim was to examine the global and regional caudate volumes, and evaluate the relationships between caudate volumes and cognitive and mood scores in SVHD and healthy adolescents. We acquired two high‐resolution T1‐weighted images from 23 SVHD and 37 controls using a 3.0‐Tesla MRI scanner, as well as assessed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9]; Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning–2; General Memory Index [GMI]) functions. Both left and right caudate nuclei were outlined, which were then used to calculate and compare volumes between groups using ANCOVA (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size), as well as perform 3D surface morphometry. Partial correlations (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size) were used to examine associations between caudate volumes, cognition, and mood scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD subjects showed significantly higher PHQ‐9 and BAI scores, indicating more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduced GMI scores, suggesting impaired cognition, compared to controls. SVHD patients showed significantly reduced caudate volumes (left, 3,198.8 ± 490.1 vs. 3,605.0 ± 480.4 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.004; right, 3,162.1 ± 475.4 vs. 3,504.8 ± 465.9 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.011) over controls, and changes were localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal areas. Significant negative correlations emerged between caudate volumes with PHQ‐9 and BAI scores and positive correlations with GMI and MoCA scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD adolescents show significantly reduced caudate volumes, especially in sites that have projections to regulate mood and cognition, which may result from developmental and/or hypoxia‐/ischemia‐induced processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Protein Interactors and Trafficking Pathways That Regulate the Cannabinoid Type 1 Receptor (CB1R)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endocannabinoid system (ECS) acts as a negative feedback mechanism to suppress synaptic transmission and plays a major role in a diverse range of brain functions including, for example, the regulation of mood, energy balance, and learning and memory. The function and dysfunction of the ECS are strongly implicated in multiple psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in the brain and, as for any synaptic receptor, CB1R needs to be in the right place at the right time to respond appropriately to changing synaptic circumstances. While CB1R is found intracellularly throughout neurons, its surface expression is highly polarized to the axonal membrane, consistent with its functional expression at presynaptic sites. Surprisingly, despite the importance of CB1R, the interacting proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate the highly polarized distribution and function of CB1R remain relatively poorly understood. Here we set out what is currently known about the trafficking pathways and protein interactions that underpin the surface expression and axonal polarity of CB1R, and highlight key questions that still need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Melatonin Act as an Antidepressant via Attenuation of Neuroinflammation by Targeting Sirt1/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Physical or psychological stress can cause an immunologic imbalance that disturbs the central nervous system followed by neuroinflammation. The association between inflammation and depression has been widely studied in recent years, though the molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. Thus, targeting the signaling pathways that link stress to neuroinflammation might be a useful strategy against depression. The current study investigated the protective effect of melatonin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and depression. Our results showed that LPS treatment significantly induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, LPS-treatment enhanced oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, NF-κB phosphorylation, and glial cell activation markers including GFAP and Iba-1 in the brain of mice. Melatonin treatment significantly abolished the effect of LPS, as indicated by improved depressive-like behaviors, reduced cytokines level, reduced oxidative stress, and normalized LPS-altered Sirt1, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression. However, the melatonin protective effects were reduced after luzindole administration. Collectively, it is concluded that melatonin receptor-dependently protects against LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors via counteracting LPS-induced neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: P2X7 Receptor Antagonism as a Potential Therapy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00093</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00093</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the purinergic ionotropic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) as a potential target for developing drugs that delay the onset and/or disease progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Description of clinical and genetic ALS features is followed by an analysis of advantages and drawbacks of transgenic mouse models of disease based on mutations in a bunch of proteins, particularly Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43), Fused in Sarcoma/Translocated in Sarcoma (FUS), and Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). Though of limited value, these models are however critical to study the proof of concept of new compounds, before reaching clinical trials. The authors also provide a description of ALS pathogenesis including protein aggregation, calcium-dependent excitotoxicity, dysfunction of calcium-binding proteins, ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations, disruption of mitochondrial calcium handling, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Understanding disease pathogenic pathways may ease the identification of new drug targets. Subsequently, neuroinflammation linked with P2X7Rs in ALS pathogenesis is described in order to understand the rationale of placing the use of P2X7R antagonists as a new therapeutic pharmacological approach to ALS. This is the basis for the hypothesis that a P2X7R blocker could mitigate the neuroinflammatory state, indirectly leading to neuroprotection and higher motoneuron survival in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Randomized, Double-Blind Assessment of LFP Versus SUA Guidance in STN-DBS Lead Implantation: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00611</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00611</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients is highly dependent on the precise localization of the target structures such as subthalamic nucleus (STN). Most commonly, microelectrode single unit activity (SUA) recordings are performed to refine the target. This process is heavily experience based and can be technically challenging. Local field potentials (LFPs), representing the activity of a population of neurons, can be obtained from the same microelectrodes used for SUA recordings and allow flexible online processing with less computational complexity due to lower sampling rate requirements. Although LFPs have been shown to contain biomarkers capable of predicting patients’ symptoms and differentiating various structures, their use in the localization of the STN in the clinical practice is not prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Here we present, for the first time, a randomized and double-blinded pilot study with intraoperative online LFP processing in which we compare the clinical benefit from SUA- versus LFP-based implantation. Ten PD patients referred for bilateral STN-DBS were randomly implanted using either SUA or LFP guided targeting in each hemisphere. Although both SUA and LFP were recorded for each STN, the electrophysiologist was blinded to one at a time. Three months postoperatively, the patients were evaluated by a neurologist blinded to the intraoperative recordings to assess the performance of each modality. While SUA-based decisions relied on the visual and auditory inspection of the raw traces, LFP-based decisions were given through an online signal processing and machine learning pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found a dramatic agreement between LFP- and SUA-based localization (16/20 STNs) providing adequate clinical improvement (51.8% decrease in 3-month contralateral motor assessment scores), with LFP-guided implantation resulting in greater average improvement in the discordant cases (74.9%, n = 3 STNs). The selected tracks were characterized by higher activity in beta (11–32 Hz) and high-frequency (200–400 Hz) bands (p &amp;lt; 0.01) of LFPs and stronger non-linear coupling between these bands (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our pilot study shows equal or better clinical benefit with LFP-based targeting. Given the robustness of the electrode interface and lower computational cost, more centers can utilize LFP as a strategic feedback modality intraoperatively, in conjunction to the SUA-guided targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Influences of Brand Awareness on Consumers’ Cognitive Process: An Event-Related Potentials Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00549</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brand awareness plays an important role in most aspects of marketing. However, consumers’ cognitive process of brand awareness, which plays an important role in purchase decision or product usage experiences, is still unclear in the brain. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), the influences of two different brand awareness on consumers’ cognitive process was investigated. Phone pictures with high or low brand awareness and girl pictures were used to carry out this experiment research. An amended oddball task was designed in which girl photos were taken as target stimuli, and phone pictures were taken as non-target stimuli. Subjects were asked to identify the girl pictures. Smaller ERPs components N2 and P3 along with high brand awareness phone pictures were found compared to the low brand awareness ones. The amplitude variation in N2 and P3 indicated that the cognitive process of identification and attention distribution were changed along with the magnitude of brand awareness, which meant consumers could allocate different attention resources to distinguish high or low brand awareness product unconsciously. This may indicate the identification and attention distribution caused by brand awareness can be detected by N2 and P3, and event-related potentials methodology may be a sensitive measurement technique for brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Suitability of Thrombolysis for Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Complicated With Trousseau Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00481</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) improves functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and is the standard first-line treatment; however, it is associated with many complications, including cerebral hemorrhage. Cancer patients are susceptible to thrombotic events – collectively referred to as Trousseau syndrome (TS) – owing to their hypercoagulable state. Here, we describe the case of a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension for over 10 years who underwent surgery for removal of a cancer of lower esophagus, with no subsequent treatment. Three months later, he was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with sudden dizziness and incoherent speech. Brain computed tomography revealed multiple cerebral infarctions. The patient was treated by IVT with tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) after the onset of symptoms, which improved by the end of the treatment. However, a few months later, he experienced a recurrence of cerebral infarction and hemorrhage, which has rarely been reported. The clinical course of this case suggests that the suitability of thrombolysis with rtPA in the acute phase of cerebral infarction complicated with TS should be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of Vestibular Rehabilitation on Spontaneous Brain Activity in Patients With Vestibular Migraine: A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00227</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00227</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that vestibular migraine (VM) is a cerebral disease with recurrent vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is an effective type of physical therapy for minimizing vestibular symptoms, as it improves vestibular compensation in patients with VM. Currently, the cerebral regions that are associated with the pathogenesis of VM are largely unknown. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of VM, we performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after 1 month of VR in 14 patients with VM. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were included as clinical outcomes. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was assessed to characterize spontaneous brain activity. The correlations between the clinical characteristics and ALFF values were assessed. After 1 month of VR training, the DHI scores in patients with VM were significantly lower than those at baseline (p = 0.03), as were the HAMA scores (p = 0.02). We also found that the ALFF values in the left posterior cerebellum of VM patients increased significantly after 1 month of VR training. Moreover, the ALFF values in the left cerebellum were inversely correlated with the patients’ DHI scores. Overall, this study showed that VR exercise for 1 month has a positive effect on vestibular symptoms in patients with VM. Asymmetric cerebellar hyperactivity might be a functional compensation for vestibular dysfunction in patients with VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity Effect on the Temporal Patterning of Neural Synchronization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural synchrony in the brain at rest is usually variable and intermittent, thus intervals of predominantly synchronized activity are interrupted by intervals of desynchronized activity. Prior studies suggested that this temporal structure of the weakly synchronous activity might be functionally significant: many short desynchronizations may be functionally different from few long desynchronizations even if the average synchrony level is the same. In this study, we used computational neuroscience methods to investigate the effects of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on the temporal patterns of synchronization in a simple model. We employed a small network of conductance-based model neurons that were connected via excitatory plastic synapses. The dynamics of this network was subjected to the time-series analysis methods used in prior experimental studies. We found that STDP could alter the synchronized dynamics in the network in several ways, depending on the time scale that plasticity acts on. However, in general, the action of STDP in the simple network considered here is to promote dynamics with short desynchronizations (i.e., dynamics reminiscent of that observed in experimental studies). Complex interplay of the cellular and synaptic dynamics may lead to the activity-dependent adjustment of synaptic strength in such a way as to facilitate experimentally observed short desynchronizations in the intermittently synchronized neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Broadband Entrainment of Striatal Low-Threshold Spike Interneurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Striatal interneurons and spiny projection (SP) neurons are differentially tuned to spectral components of their input. Previous studies showed that spike responses of somatostatin/NPY-expressing low threshold spike (LTS) interneurons have broad frequency tuning, setting these cells apart from other striatal GABAergic interneurons and SP neurons. We investigated the mechanism of LTS interneuron spiking resonance and its relationship to non-spiking membrane impedance resonance, finding that abolition of impedance resonance did not alter spiking resonance. Because LTS interneurons are pacemakers whose rhythmic firing is perturbed by synaptic input, we tested the hypothesis that their spiking resonance arises from their phase resetting properties. Phase resetting curves (PRCs) were measured in LTS interneurons and SP neurons and used to make phase-oscillator models of both cell types. The models reproduced the broad tuning of LTS interneurons, and the differences from SP neurons. The spectral components of the PRC predicted each cell’s sensitivity to corresponding input frequencies. LTS interneuron PRCs contain larger high-frequency components than SP neuron PRCs, providing enhanced responses to input frequencies above the cells’ average firing rates. Thus, LTS cells can be entrained by input oscillations to which SP neurons are less responsive. These findings suggest that feedforward inhibition by LTS interneurons may regulate SP neurons’ entrainment by oscillatory afferents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Insights Into Spinal Dorsal Horn Circuit Function and Dysfunction Using Optical Approaches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Somatosensation encompasses a variety of essential modalities including touch, pressure, proprioception, temperature, pain, and itch. These peripheral sensations are crucial for all types of behaviors, ranging from social interaction to danger avoidance. Somatosensory information is transmitted from primary afferent fibers in the periphery into the central nervous system via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The dorsal horn functions as an intermediary processing center for this information, comprising a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons as well as projection neurons that transmit the processed somatosensory information from the spinal cord to the brain. It is now known that there can be dysfunction within this spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain conditions and that these perturbations contribute to the development and maintenance of pathological pain. However, the complex and heterogeneous network of the spinal dorsal horn has hampered efforts to further elucidate its role in somatosensory processing. Emerging optical techniques promise to illuminate the underlying organization and function of the dorsal horn and provide insights into the role of spinal cord sensory processing in shaping the behavioral response to somatosensory input that we ultimately observe. This review article will focus on recent advances in optogenetics and fluorescence imaging techniques in the spinal cord, encompassing findings from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. We will also discuss the current limitations and difficulties of employing these techniques to interrogate the spinal cord and current practices and approaches to overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopaminergic Modulation of Glomerular Circuits in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00172</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00172</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic neurons are located in several brain areas including the olfactory bulb (OB) and involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the OB, dopamine (DA) is released exclusively by a population of interneurons termed short axon cells (SACs) in the glomerular layer, the initial synaptic integration site of the whole olfactory system. SACs corelease GABA and extend their processes to many glomeruli forming the interglomerular circuit. Two major groups of DA receptors D1-like (D1LRs) and D2-like (D2LRs) types are differentially distributed in the OB, i.e., D1LRs are broadly present except the most superficial olfactory nerve (ON) layer while D2LRs are predominantly confined to the ON and glomerular layers, suggesting that they mediate different physiological functions. In contrast to the well-known D2LR-mediated presynaptic inhibition of ON terminals in the OB, the cellular and circuit targets of the D1LR-mediated DA actions remain unclear even though D1LR activation improves odor detection and discrimination. We recently demonstrated that endogenous DA released from SACs or exogenous DA excites a population of excitatory glomerular neurons termed external tufted cells (ETCs) via D1LRs. But the physiological significance of this D1LR activation is largely unknown. In the present study, we addressed these questions by a systematic examination of exogenous DA actions on synaptic activities and excitabilities in most glomerular neurons and OB output neurons with the following major findings: (1) DA via D1LRs enhances OB output by potentiating the ETC-mediated feedforward excitation to the OB output neurons but suppresses spontaneous excitatory synaptic activities in both types of inhibitory glomerular interneurons periglomerular (PGCs) and SACs; (2) this suppression of excitatory synaptic activities in PGCs and SACs depends on activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors; (3) DA via D1LRs augments spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activities in all glomerular neurons and OB output neurons; (4) DA selectively activates SACs via D1LRs. These findings suggest that activation of D1LRs elevates the system’s sensitivity to odor stimuli and provide a mechanistic basis for the functional roles of DA in modulating odor detection and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that the cell-to-cell spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) plays important roles in the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD patients who carry α-syn gene mutations often have an earlier onset and more severe clinical symptoms and pathology than sporadic PD cases who carry the wild-type (WT) α-syn gene. However, the molecular mechanism by which α-syn gene mutations promote PD remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that pathogenic mutations facilitate the intercellular transfer and cytotoxicity of α-syn, favoring an early disease onset and faster progression. We investigated the effects of eight known pathogenic mutations in human α-syn (A18T, A29S, A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E, and A53T) on its pathological transmission in terms of secretion, aggregation, intracellular level, cytotoxicity, seeding, and induction of neuroinflammation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, cultured rat neurons, and microglia, and the rat substantia nigra pars compacta. We found that 2 of the 8 mutations (H50Q and A53T) significantly increased α-syn secretion while 6 mutations (A18T, A29S, A30P, G51D, A53E, and E46K) tended to enhance it. In vitroα-syn aggregation experiments showed that H50Q promoted while G51D delayed aggregation most strongly. Interestingly, 3 mutations (E46K, H50Q, and G51D) greatly increased the intracellular α-syn level when cultured cells were treated with preformed α-syn fibrils (PFFs) compared with the WT, while the other 5 had no effect. We also demonstrated that H50Q, G51D, and A53T PFFs, but not E46K PFFs, efficiently seeded in vivo and acutely induced neuroinflammation in rat substantia nigra pars compacta. Our data indicate that pathogenic mutations augment the prion-like spread of α-syn at different steps and blockade of this pathogenic propagation may serve as a promising therapeutic intervention for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: VIP Modulation of Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity: A Role for VIP Receptors as Therapeutic Targets in Cognitive Decline and Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an important modulatory peptide throughout the CNS acting as a neurotransmitter, neurotrophic or neuroprotective factor. In the hippocampus, a brain area implicated in learning and memory processes, VIP has a crucial role in the control of GABAergic transmission and pyramidal cell activity in response to specific network activity by either VIP-containing basket cells or interneuron-selective (IS) interneurons and this appears to have a differential impact in hippocampal-dependent cognition. At the cellular level, VIP regulates synaptic transmission by either promoting disinhibition, through activation of VPAC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, or enhancing pyramidal cell excitability, through activation of VPAC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. These actions also control several important synaptic plasticity phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). This paper reviews the current knowledge on the activation and multiple functions of VIP expressing cells in the hippocampus and their role in controlling synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes, discussing also the role of VPAC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and VPAC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; VIP receptors in the regulation of these different processes. Furthermore, we address the current knowledge regarding changes in VIP mediated neurotransmission in epileptogenesis and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), and discuss the therapeutic opportunities of using selective VIP receptor ligands to prevent epileptogenesis and cognitive decline in MTLE-HS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Three-Dimensional Alzheimer’s Disease Cell Culture Model Using iPSC-Derived Neurons Carrying A246E Mutation in PSEN1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00151</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic brain disorder characterized by progressive intellectual decline and memory and neuronal loss, caused mainly by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, primarily in areas implicated in memory and learning as prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. There are two forms of AD, a late-onset form that affects people over 65 years old, and the early-onset form, which is hereditable and affect people at early ages ~45 years. To date, there is no cure for the disease; consequently, it is essential to develop new tools for the study of processes implicated in the disease. Currently, in vitro AD three-dimensional (3D) models using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons have broadened the horizon for in vitro disease modeling and gained interest for mechanistic studies and preclinical drug discovery due to their potential advantages in providing a better physiologically relevant information and more predictive data for in vivo tests. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a 3D cell culture model of AD in vitro using iPSCs carrying the A246E mutation. We generated human iPSCs from fibroblasts from a patient with AD harboring the A246E mutation in the PSEN1 gene. Cell reprogramming was performed using lentiviral vectors with Yamanaka’s factors (OSKM: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). The resulting iPSCs expressed pluripotency genes (such as Nanog and Oct4), alkaline phosphatase activity, and pluripotency stem cell marker expression, such as OCT4, SOX2, TRA-1-60, and SSEA4. iPSCs exhibited the ability to differentiate into neuronal lineage in a 3D environment through dual SMAD inhibition as confirmed by Nestin, MAP2, and Tuj1 neural marker expression. These iPSC-derived neurons harbored Aβ oligomers confirmed by Western Blot (WB) and immunostaining. With human iPSC-derived neurons able to produce Aβ oligomers, we established a novel human hydrogel-based 3D cell culture model that recapitulates Aβ aggregation without the need for mutation induction or synthetic Aβ exposure. This model will allow the study of processes implicated in disease spread throughout the brain, the screening of molecules or compounds with therapeutic potential, and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Epilepsy and Neuroscience: Evolution and Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is a relatively new and fashionable word that emerged in the 1950s in several countries, including the UK, to describe a multidisciplinary clinical and laboratory approach to the study of the brain, mind, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However collaborative study of neurological and psychiatric disorders can be traced to the 17th century with roots in antiquity. I describe the evolution of our understanding of epilepsy beginning with the first detailed clinical descriptions, associated with supernatural theories, in Babylonian medicine in the second millennium BC. Interest in natural causation arose in the Greco-Roman period when it was first suggested that “the sacred disease” was a disorder of the brain. However, this theory did not take root until the 17th and 18th centuries AD when epilepsy began to be separated from other “convulsive” diseases, including hysteria. In the 19th century developments in neuropathology and our understanding of cortical localization led to the much-debated separation of idiopathic from symptomatic epilepsy which continues to influence international classifications of seizures and epilepsies. Also in the 19th century, the concept of seizures as electrical discharges in the brain evolved, reinforced in the 20th century by the discovery of the electroencephalogram. For many reasons, people with epilepsy have experienced a high incidence of cognitive and psychosocial disorders. Epilepsy, which is a global problem, has, therefore, remained a bridge between neurology and psychiatry. Furthermore, the study of epilepsy continues to shed light on brain function and other neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Resting-State Network Functional Connectivity in Cognitive Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00177</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with disruptions in the resting-state functional architecture of the brain. Previous studies have primarily focused on age-related declines in the default mode network (DMN) and its implications in Alzheimer’s disease. However, due to mixed findings, it is unclear if changes in resting-state network functional connectivity are linked to cognitive decline in healthy older adults. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of intra-network coherence for four higher-order cognitive resting-state networks on a sensitive measure of cognitive aging (i.e., NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Battery) in 154 healthy older adults with a mean age of 71 and education ranging between 12 years and 21 years (mean = 16). Only coherence within the cingulo-opercular network (CON) was significantly related to Fluid Cognition Composite scores, explaining more variance in scores than age and education. Furthermore, we mapped CON connectivity onto fluid cognitive subdomains that typically decline in advanced age. Greater CON connectivity was associated with better performance on episodic memory, attention, and executive function tasks. Overall, the present study provides evidence to propose CON coherence as a potential novel neural marker for nonpathological cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Macrophages and Associated Ligands in the Aged Injured Nerve: A Defective Dynamic That Contributes to Reduced Axonal Regrowth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of injured peripheral nerves is diminished with aging. To identify factors that contribute to this impairment, we compared the immune cell response in young vs. aged animals following nerve injury. First, we confirmed that macrophage accumulation is delayed in aged injured nerves which is due to defects in monocyte migration as a result of defects in site-specific recruitment signals in the aged nerve. Interestingly, impairment in both macrophage accumulation and functional recovery could be overcome by transplanting bone marrow from aged animals into young mice. That is, upon exposure to a youthful environment, monocytes/macrophages originating from the aged bone marrow behaved similarly to young cells. Transcriptional profiling of aged macrophages following nerve injury revealed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes were largely downregulated in aged compared to young macrophages. One ligand of particular interest was macrophage-associated secreted protein (MCP1), which exhibited a potent role in regulating aged axonal regrowth in vitro. Given that macrophage-derived MCP1 is significantly diminished in the aged injured nerve, our data suggest that age-associated defects in MCP1 signaling could contribute to the regenerative deficits that occur in the aged nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neural Mechanisms of the Contextual Interference Effect and Parameter Similarity on Motor Learning in Older Adults: An EEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00173</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00173</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of the contextual interference effect (CIE) and parameter similarity on motor learning in older adults. Sixty older adults (mean age, 67.68 ± 3.95 years) were randomly assigned to one of six experimental groups: blocked-similar, algorithm-similar, random-similar, blocked-dissimilar, algorithm-dissimilar, and random-dissimilar. Algorithm practice was a hybrid practice schedule (a combination of blocked, serial, and random practice) that switching between practice schedules were based on error trial number, ≤33%. The sequential motor task was used to record the absolute timing for the absolute timing goals (ATGs). In similar conditions, the participants’ performance was near ATGs (1,350, 1,500, 1,650 ms) and in dissimilar conditions, they performed far ATGs (1,050, 1,500, 1,950 ms) with the same spatial sequence for all groups. EEG signals were continuously collected during the acquisition phase and delayed retention. Data were analyzed in different bands (alpha and beta) and scalp locations (frontal: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4; central: C3, C4; and parietal: P3, P4) with repeated measures on the last factor. The analyses were included motor preparation and intertrial interval (motor evaluation) periods in the first six blocks and the last six blocks, respectively. The results of behavioral data indicated that algorithm practice resulted in medium error related to classic blocked and random practice during the acquisition, however, algorithm practice outperformed the classic blocked and random practice in the delayed retention test. The results of EEG data demonstrated that algorithm practice, due to optimal activity in the frontal lobe (medium alpha and beta activation at prefrontal), resulted in increased activity of sensorimotor areas (high alpha activation at C3 and P4) in older adults. Also, EEG data showed that similar conditions could affect the intertrial interval period (medium alpha and beta activation in frontal in the last six-block), while the dissimilar conditions could affect the motor preparation period (medium alpha and beta activation in frontal in the first six-block). In conclusion, algorithm practice can enhance motor learning and optimize the efficiency of brain activity, resulting in the achievement of a desirable goal in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A mechanistic, stigmergy model of territory formation in solitary animals: Territorial behavior can dampen disease prevalence but increase persistence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lauren A. White, Sue VandeWoude, Meggan E. Craft&lt;/p&gt;

Although movement ecology has leveraged models of home range formation to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity and social cues on movement behavior, disease ecology has yet to integrate these potential drivers and mechanisms of contact behavior into a generalizable disease modeling framework. Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy—the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)—dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the “territoriality benefits” hypothesis—where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hx7Ij3rh8bk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Can fructose influence the development of obesity mediated through hypothalamic alterations?</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological data from the last decades point to an exponential growth in the number of obese people. Different behavioral factors, mainly associated with food consumption, appear to contribute significantly to its development. Concomitant with increased obesity rates, an increase in the consumption of fructose has been observed; therefore, fructose consumption has been implicated as an important obesogenic factor. However, changes in brain activity due to fructose consumption are possible, especially in relation to hypothalamic satiety mechanisms. In addition, the obese state may provide an environment of chronic inflammation and further contribute to the discontinuation of satiety mechanisms in the hypothalamus. We briefly review the intrinsic alterations to the increased adipose tissue, its connections with the hypothalamus in the control of energy signaling mechanisms and, consequently, the participation of fructose as a co‐adjuvant or trigger. Presenting the current context with clinical trials involving human and animal studies, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the role of fructose in the progression of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A major part of the circuit that coordinates bladder voiding is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5–S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II–IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II–IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Rats and mice have similar patterns of retrogradely labeled neurons that project axons to the NTS.
Afferent neurons in the hypothalamus are glutamatergic, while those in the amygdala are GABAergic.
In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, NTS afferent neurons are distinct from neuroendocrine neurons.
Injecting retrograde tracers into the medial and lateral NTS subdivisions produce similar patterns of retrograde labeling.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain's primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6 &lt;/i&gt;/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc32a1 &lt;/i&gt;/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association Between Pregnancy and Cervical Artery Dissection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25813?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether pregnancy is associated with cervical artery dissection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a case–control study using claims data from all nonfederal emergency departments and acute care hospitals in New York and Florida between 2005–2015. Cases were women 12–42 years of age hospitalized with cervical artery dissection, defined using validated diagnosis codes for carotid/vertebral artery dissection. Controls were women 12–42 years of age with a primary diagnosis of renal colic. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 on age, race, insurance, income, state, and visit year. The exposure variable was pregnancy, defined as labor and delivery within 90 days before or 6 months after the index visit. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of pregnancy between cases and controls. We performed a secondary cohort‐crossover study comparing the risk of cervical artery dissection during pregnancy versus the same time period 1 year later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy was twice as common among 826 women with cervical artery dissection compared to the 826 matched controls with renal colic (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.7). In our secondary analysis, pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of cervical artery dissection (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.5), with the heightened risk limited to the postpartum period (IRR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.6–11.7).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy, specifically the postpartum period, was associated with hospitalization for cervical artery dissection. Although these findings may partly reflect ascertainment bias, our results suggest that arterial dissection is one mechanism by which pregnancy can lead to stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neurofilament-Light Chain as Biomarker of Neurodegenerative and Rare Diseases With High Translational Value</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00579</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00579</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) is a well-known clinical biomarker of many neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma, progression of NF-L levels can forecast conversion from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stage and time of survival. The use of plasma for NF-L measurement makes this biomarker exceptionally valuable for clinical studies since sample collection can be performed repeatedly without causing much harm. Detailed analyses of NF-L expression in neurodegenerative disease patient’s samples were already performed, while NF-L levels of preclinical models of ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease as well as lysosomal storage diseases are still widely unknown. We therefore evaluated NF-L levels in the plasma of the ALS models SOD1-G93A low expressor and TAR6/6 mice, the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model 5xFAD, the Parkinson’s disease model Line 61 and the Gaucher disease (GD) model 4L/PS-NA and the CSF of selected models. Our results show that NF-L levels are highly increased in the plasma of ALS, Alzheimer’s and GD models, while in the analyzed Parkinson’s disease model NF-L plasma levels barely changed. Most analyzed models show a progressive increase of NF-L levels. NF-L measurements in the plasma of the neurodegenerative disease mouse models of ALS and AD are thus a good tool to evaluate disease progression. Compared to analyses in human tissues, our results suggest a high translation value of murine NF-L levels and their progression. Furthermore, our data indicate that NF-L might also be a good biomarker for disorders with a neuronal component like some lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
