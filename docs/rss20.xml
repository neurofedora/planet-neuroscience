Predation on swarms of prey, especially using visual information, has drawn much interest in studies of collective movement. Surprisingly, in the field of biosonar this aspect of prey detection, which is probably very common, has received little to no attention. Here, we combine computer simulations and actual echo measurements to accurately estimate the echo sound pressure of insect swarms of different size and density. We show that swarm echo sound pressure increases with 3dB for every doubling of insect number, irrespective of swarm density. Thus swarms will be much easier to detect than single insects. Many of the insects bats eat are so small that they are only detectable by echolocation at very short distances. By focusing on detection of swarms of insects, a bat may increase its operating range and diversify its diet. Interestingly, interference between the sound waves reflected from a swarm of insects can sometimes result in echoes that are much weaker than echoes from single insects. We show that bats can reduce this problem by increasing the bandwidth of their echolocation calls. Specifically, a bandwidth of 3–8 kHz would guarantee receiving loud echoes from any angle relative to the swarm. Indeed, many bat species, and specifically bats hunting in open spaces, where swarms are abundant, use echolocation signals with a bandwidth of several kHz. Our results might also explain how the first echolocating bats that probably had limited echolocation abilities, could detect insects through swarm hunting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c7ttugHNwwM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Incomplete information about the partner affects the development of collaborative strategies in joint action</title>

Physical interaction with a partner plays an essential role in our life experience and is the basis of many daily activities. When two physically coupled humans have different and partly conflicting goals, they face the challenge of negotiating some type of collaboration. This requires that both participants understand their partner’s state and current actions. But, how would the collaboration be affected if information about their partner were unreliable or incomplete? We designed an experiment in which two players (a dyad) are mechanically connected through a virtual spring, but cannot see each other. They were instructed to perform reaching movements with the same start and end position, but through different via-points. In different groups of dyads we varied the amount of information provided to each player about his/her partner: haptic only (the interaction force perceived through the virtual spring), visuo-haptic (the interaction force is also displayed on the screen), and partner visible (in addition to interaction force, partner position is continuously displayed on the screen). We found that incomplete information about the partner affects not only the speed at which collaboration is achieved (less information, slower learning), but also the actual collaboration strategy. In particular, incomplete or unreliable information leads to an interaction strategy characterized by alternating leader-follower roles. Conversely, more reliable information leads to more synchronous behaviors, in which no specific roles can be identified. Simulations based on a combination of game theory and Bayesian estimation suggested that synchronous behaviors correspond to optimal interaction (Nash equilibrium). Roles emerge as sub-optimal forms of interaction, which minimize the need to account for the partner. These findings suggest that collaborative strategies in joint action are shaped by the trade-off between the task requirements and the uncertainty of the information available about the partner.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/paWq-bGuVHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;When postmortem studies related to transgender individuals were first published, little was known about the function of the various identified nuclei. Now, over 2 decades later, significant progress has been made associating function with specific brain regions, as well as in identifying networks associated with groups of behaviors. However, much of this progress has not been integrated into the general conceptualization of gender dysphoria in humans. I hypothesize that in individuals with gender dysphoria, the aspects of chronic distress, gender atypical behavior, and incongruence between perception of gender identity and external primary sex characteristics are all directly related to functional differences in associated brain networks. I evaluated previously published neuroscience data related to these aspects and the associated functional networks, along with other relevant information. I find that the brain networks that give individuals their ownership of body parts, that influence gender typical behavior, and that are involved in chronic distress are different in individuals with and without gender dysphoria, leading to a new theory—that gender dysphoria is a sensory perception condition, an alteration in the sense of gender influenced by the reflexive behavioral responses associated with each of these networks. This theory builds upon previous work that supports the relevance of the body-ownership network and that questions the relevance of cerebral sexual dimorphism in regard to gender dysphoria. However, my theory uses a hierarchical executive function model to incorporate multiple reflexive factors (body ownership, gender typical/atypical behavior, and chronic distress) with the cognitive, reflective process of gender identity.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SCN1A Variants in vaccine‐related febrile seizures: A prospective study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25650?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25650?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Febrile seizures may follow vaccination. Common variants in the sodium channel gene, &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt;, are associated with febrile seizures, and rare pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; cause the severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome. Following vaccination, febrile seizures may raise the specter of poor outcome and inappropriately implicate vaccination as the cause. We aimed to determine the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variants in children having their first febrile seizure either proximal to vaccination or unrelated to vaccination compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; sequencing, blind to clinical category, in a prospective cohort of children presenting with their first febrile seizure as vaccine proximate (n = 69) or as non–vaccine proximate (n = 75), and children with no history of seizures (n = 90) recruited in Australian pediatric hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detected 2 pathogenic variants in vaccine‐proximate cases (p.R568X and p.W932R), both of whom developed Dravet syndrome, and 1 in a non–vaccine‐proximate case (p.V947L) who had febrile seizures plus from 9 months. All had generalized tonic–clonic seizures lasting &amp;gt;15 minutes. We also found enrichment of a reported risk allele, rs6432860‐T, in children with febrile seizures compared to controls (odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.31–2.81).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variants may be identified in infants with vaccine‐proximate febrile seizures. As early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome is essential for optimal management and outcome, &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; sequencing in infants with prolonged febrile seizures, proximate to vaccination, should become routine.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sensitivity to grayscale textures is adapted to natural scene statistics. (arXiv:1912.05433v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The efficient coding hypothesis posits that sensory circuits and animal
behavior should be adapted to the statistical structure of natural signals.
Here, we show that the perception of visual textures is adapted to the spatial
distribution of light signals at a striking level of detail. We first identify
a parametrized 66-dimensional space of grayscale textures defined by local
spatial correlations between discrete light intensities. We then devise a
method of measuring the contribution of each of these textures to the spatial
structure of scenes. Efficient coding predicts that the perceptual salience of
a complex sensory signal should be related to its variability in natural
settings. Based on an analysis of contrast-equalized natural scenes, this
theory predicts that textures involving two-point correlations will be most
salient, and it further predicts the relative salience among second-order
correlations of different types. We test our predictions by asking observers to
locate a briefly-flashed texture strip in a background of white noise. The
behavior of individual subjects is highly consistent: correlations beyond the
second order are hard to distinguish from random noise, and detection
thresholds within this salient second-order subspace are quantitatively
predicted across 26 two-dimensional texture planes. We additionally find
non-trivial symmetries of natural images that leave psychophysical thresholds
unchanged, further supporting our hypothesis. These findings significantly
extend previous results obtained for binary images, and they provide deeper
insights into the relationship between natural signal statistics and human
perception.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Suppression of hypersynchronous network activity in cultured cortical neurons using an ultrasoft silicone scaffold. (arXiv:1912.05050v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05050</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous activity pattern of cortical neurons in dissociated culture
is characterized by burst firing that is highly synchronized among a wide
population of cells. The degree of synchrony, however, is excessively higher
than that in cortical tissues. Here, we employed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
elastomers to establish a novel system for culturing neurons on a scaffold with
an elastic modulus resembling brain tissue, and investigated the effect of the
scaffold's elasticity on network activity patterns in cultured rat cortical
neurons. Using whole-cell patch clamp to assess the scaffold effect on the
development of synaptic connections, we found that the amplitude of excitatory
postsynaptic current, as well as the frequency of spontaneous transmissions,
was reduced in neuronal networks grown on an ultrasoft PDMS with an elastic
modulus of 0.5 kPa. Furthermore, the ultrasoft scaffold was found to suppress
neural correlations in the spontaneous activity of the cultured neuronal
network. The dose of GsMTx-4, an antagonist of stretch-activated cation
channels (SACs), required to reduce the generation of the events below 1.0
event/min on PDMS substrates was lower than that for neurons on a glass
substrate. This suggests that the difference in the baseline level of SAC
activation is a molecular mechanism underlying the alteration in neuronal
network activity depending on scaffold stiffness. Our results demonstrate the
potential application of PDMS with biomimetic elasticity as cell-culture
scaffold for bridging the in vivo-in vitro gap in neuronal systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Category learning can alter perception and its neural correlates. (arXiv:1805.04619v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learned Categorical Perception (CP) occurs when the members of different
categories come to look more dissimilar (between-category separation) and/or
members of the same category come to look more similar (within-category
compression) after a new category has been learned. To measure learned CP and
its physiological correlates we compared dissimilarity judgments and Event
Related Potentials (ERPs) before and after learning to sort multi-featured
visual textures into two categories by trial and error with corrective
feedback. With the same number of trials and feedback, about half the
participants succeeded in learning the categories (learners: criterion 80%
accuracy) and the rest did not (non-learners). At both lower and higher levels
of difficulty, successful learners showed significant between-category
separation in pairwise dissimilarity judgments after learning compared to
before; their late parietal ERP positivity (LPC, usually interpreted as
decisional) also increased and their occipital negativity (N1) (usually
interpreted as perceptual) decreased. LPC increased with response accuracy and
N1 amplitude decreased with between-category separation for the Learners.
Non-learners showed no significant changes in dissimilarity judgments, LPC or
N1, within or between categories. This is behavioral and physiological evidence
that category learning can alter perception. We sketch a neural net model for
this effect.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Microtubule-Binding Drug Attenuates and Reverses Protein Aggregation in Animal Models of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-progressive neurodegenerative pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are distinguished and diagnosed by disease-specific components of intra- or extra-cellular aggregates. Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation promotes protein aggregation, and is involved in the etiology of neurological diseases. We synthesized and tested analogs of the naturally occurring tubulin-binding compound, combretastatin A-4. One such analog, PNR502, markedly reduced the quantity of Alzheimer-associated amyloid aggregates in the BRI-Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; mouse model of AD, while blunting the ability of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to raise levels of amyloid plaque and its protein precursors in a neuronal cell-culture model. In transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) strains that express human Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in muscle or neurons, PNR502 rescued Aβ-induced disruption of motility (3.8-fold, P &amp;lt; 0.0001) or chemotaxis (1.8-fold, P &amp;lt; 0.05), respectively. Moreover, in C. elegans with neuronal expression of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;, a single day of PNR502 exposure reverses the chemotaxis deficit by 54% (P &amp;lt; 0.01), actually exceeding the protection from longer exposure. Moreover, continuous PNR502 treatment extends nematode lifespan 23% (P ≤ 0.001). Given that PNR502 can slow, prevent, or reverse Alzheimer-like protein aggregation in human-cell-culture and animal models, and that its principal predicted and observed binding targets are proteins previously implicated in Alzheimer’s, we propose that PNR502 has therapeutic potential to inhibit cerebral Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; aggregation and prevent or reverse neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cytoglobin Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Lipopolysaccharide-Activated Primary Preoptic Area Cells via NF-κB Pathway Inhibition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00307</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexacoordinate protein, associated with the transport of oxygen, nitric oxide scavenging, tumor suppression and protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. This protein is expressed in brain areas including the preoptic area (POA) of the anterior hypothalamus, the region responsible for the regulation of body temperature. In this study, we show that Cygb is upregulated in the rat hypothalamus 2.5 h and 5 h after intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We investigated the effect of treatment with Cygb in POA primary cultures stimulated with LPS for 4 h. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured and the results showed that Cygb reduced the concentrations of both cytokines. We further observed a decrease in immunoreactivity of the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), but not NF-IL6 and STAT3, in the nucleus of Cygb-treated POA cells. These findings suggest that Cygb attenuates the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated POA primary cultures via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating that this protein might play an important role in the control of neuroinflammation and fever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory synapses represent a minority of the total chemical synapses in the mammalian brain, yet proper tuning of inhibition is fundamental to shape neuronal network properties. The neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediates rapid synaptic inhibition by the activation of the type A GABA receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R), a pentameric chloride channel that governs major inhibitory neuronal transduction in the nervous system. Impaired GABA transmission leads to a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy or anxiety. From an evolutionary perspective, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R shows remarkable conservations, and are found in all eukaryotic clades and even in bacteria and archaea. Specifically, bona fide GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Because of the anatomical simplicity of the nervous system and its amenability to genetic manipulations, C. elegans provide a powerful system to investigate the molecular and cellular biology of GABA synapses. In this mini review article, we will introduce the structure of the C. elegans GABAergic system and describe recent advances that have identified novel proteins controlling the localization of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs at synapses. In particular, Ce-Punctin/MADD-4 is an evolutionarily-conserved extracellular matrix protein that behaves as an anterograde synaptic organizer to instruct the excitatory or inhibitory identity of postsynaptic domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important regulatory control in biological systems. Though the field of lncRNA has been progressing rapidly, a complete understanding of the role of lncRNAs in neuroblastoma pathogenesis is still lacking. To identify the abrogated lncRNAs in primary neuroblastoma and in the metastasized as well as the relapsed form of neuroblastoma, we analyzed an RNA-seq dataset on neuroblastoma that is available online to identify the lncRNAs that could potentially be contributing to the biology of neuroblastoma. The identified lncRNAs were further scrutinized using a publicly available epigenetic dataset of neuroblastoma and a cancer database. After this cross-sectional study, we were able to identify three significant lncRNAs, CASC15, PPP1R26-AS1, and USP3-AS1, which could serve as potential biomarkers in clinical studies of neuroblastoma pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Exosome Production Is Key to Neuronal Endosomal Pathway Integrity in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of the endosomal–lysosomal system is a prominent pathogenic factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We and others have extensively characterized the neuronal endosomal pathway pathology that results from either triplication of the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) gene in Down syndrome (DS) or from expression of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), the greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. More recently brain exosomes, extracellular vesicles that are generated within and released from endosomal compartments, have been shown to be altered in DS and by APOE4 expression. In this review, we discuss the emerging data arguing for an interdependence between exosome production and endosomal pathway integrity in the brain. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that altered trafficking through the endosomal pathway or compromised cargo turnover within lysosomes can affect the production, secretion, and content of exosomes. Conversely, exosome biogenesis can affect the endosomal–lysosomal system. Indeed, we propose that efficient exosome release helps to modulate flux through the neuronal endosomal pathway by decompressing potential “traffic jams.” Exosome secretion may have the added benefit of unburdening the neuron’s lysosomal system by delivering endosomal–lysosomal material into the extracellular space, where other cell types may contribute to the degradation of neuronal debris. Thus, maintaining robust neuronal exosome production may prevent or mitigate endosomal and lysosomal abnormalities linked to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. While the current evidence suggests that the exosomal system in the brain can be modulated both by membrane lipid composition and the expression of key proteins that contribute to the formation and secretion of exosomes, how exosomal pathway-regulatory elements sense and respond to perturbations in the endosomal pathway is not well understood. Based upon findings from the extensively studied DS and APOE4 models, we propose that enhanced neuronal exosome secretion can be a protective response, reducing pathological disruption of the endosomal–lysosomal system in disease-vulnerable neurons. Developing therapeutic approaches that help to maintain or enhance neuronal exosome biogenesis and release may be beneficial in a range of disorders of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The use of serious game tools in training of medical professions is steadily growing. However, there is a lack of reliable performance assessment methods to evaluate learner’s outcome. The aim of this study is to determine whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used as an additional tool for assessing the learning outcome of virtual reality (VR) based learning modules. The hypothesis is that together with an improvement in learning outcome there would be a decrease in the participants’ cerebral oxygenation levels measured from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region and an increase of participants’ serious gaming results. To test this hypothesis, the subjects were recruited and divided into four groups with different combinations of prior virtual reality experience and prior Basic Life Support (BLS) knowledge levels. A VR based serious gaming module for teaching BLS and 16-Channel fNIRS system were used to collect data from the participants. Results of the participants’ scores acquired from the serious gaming module were compared with fNIRS measures on the initial and final training sessions. Kruskal Wallis test was run to determine any significant statistical difference between the groups and Mann–Whitney U test was utilized to obtain pairwise comparisons. BLS training scores of the participants acquired from VR based serious game’s the learning management system and fNIRS measurements revealed decrease in use of resources from the PFC, but increase in behavioral performance. Importantly, brain-based measures can provide an additional quantitative metric for trainee’s expertise development and can assist the medical simulation instructors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background and Objectives&lt;p&gt;The underlying neuropathology of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) remains elusive in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We aim to investigate neural network changes that underlie EDS in PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Early PD patients comprising eighty-one patients without EDS (EDS−) and seventeen patients with EDS (EDS+) received a resting state functional MRI scan and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Connectivities within the default mode network (DMN), motor and basal ganglia networks were compared between the EDS+ and EDS− groups. Correlations between network connectivity and the severity of EDS were investigated through linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;EDS+ patients displayed a trend of increased network connectivity of the posterior DMN (pDMN). A significant positive correlation was found between connectivity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the pDMN and ESS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;EDS+ patients are likely to display increased activation in the DMN, suggesting neural compensation in early PD or impaired attentiveness due to mechanisms such as mind-wandering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying brain effective connectivity (EC) networks from neuroimaging data has become an effective tool that can evaluate normal brain functions and the injuries associated with neurodegenerative diseases. So far, there are many methods used to identify EC networks. However, most of the research currently focus on learning EC networks from single modal imaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This paper proposes a new method, called ACOEC-FD, to learn EC networks from fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using ant colony optimization (ACO). First, ACOEC-FD uses DTI data to acquire some positively correlated relations among regions of interest (ROI), and takes them as anatomical constraint information to effectively restrict the search space of candidate arcs in an EC network. ACOEC-FD then achieves multi-modal imaging data integration by incorporating anatomical constraint information into the heuristic function of probabilistic transition rules to effectively encourage ants more likely to search for connections between structurally connected regions. Through simulation studies on generated datasets and real fMRI-DTI datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach results in improved inference results on EC compared to some methods that only used fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Concerning Auricular Vagal Nerve Stimulation: Occult Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auricular vagal nerve stimulation (AVNS) is an evolving neuromodulation technology that has a wide range of therapeutic applications across multiple disciplines of medical science. To date, AVNS results had been interpreted in the context of a monolog concept of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN): that this is the sole network of the mechanism of action and/or structure in the auricular area of the stimulation in the context of activations in the brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), locus coeruleus (LC), trigeminal brainstem nuclei, and the nucleus cuneatus. This review considers the overlooked aspects of neural networks, connections, hijacking axons from cranial nerves and cervical sympathetic ganglions, the inhomogeneous distribution of perivascular sympathetic nerves, and intrinsic/extrinsic auricular muscles in the auricular zone that can explain the vagal and non-vagal nucleus activations in AVNS. In addition, the unique cortical representation of the human ear and interspecies differences in the auricula are discussed. The detailed auricular anatomy of the AVNS zone explored in the present study references structural and functional neural network information to overcome default designs and misinterpretations of existing research on AVNS to provide a better foundation for future investigations that use this modality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Disrupted Information Flow in Resting-State in Adolescents With Sports Related Concussion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Children and youths are at a greater risk of concussions than adults, and once injured, take longer to recover. A key feature of concussion is an increase in functional connectivity, yet it remains unclear how changes in functional connectivity relate to the patterns of information flow within resting state networks following concussion and how these relate to brain function. We applied a data-driven measure of directed effective brain connectivity to compare the patterns of information flow in healthy adolescents and adolescents with subacute concussion during the resting state condition. Data from 32 healthy adolescents (mean age =16 years) and 21 concussed adolescents (mean age = 15 years) within 1 week of injury were included in the study. Five minutes of resting state data EEG were collected while participants sat quietly with their eyes closed. We applied the information flow rate to measure the transfer of information between the EEG time series of each individual at different source locations, and therefore between different brain regions. Based on the ensemble means of the magnitude of normalized information flow rate, our analysis shows that the dominant nexus of information flow in healthy adolescents is primarily left lateralized and anterior-centric, characterized by strong bidirectional information exchange between the frontal regions, and between the frontal and the central/temporal regions. In contrast, adolescents with concussion show distinct differences in information flow marked by a more left-right symmetrical, albeit still primarily anterior-centric, pattern of connections, diminished activity along the central-parietal midline axis, and the emergence of inter-hemispheric connections between the left and right frontal and the left and right temporal regions of the brain. We also find that the statistical distribution of the normalized information flow rates in each group (control and concussed) is significantly different. This paper is the first to describe the characteristics of the source space information flow and the effective connectivity patterns between brain regions in healthy adolescents in juxtaposition with the altered spatial pattern of information flow in adolescents with concussion, statistically quantifying the differences in the distribution of the information flow rate between the two populations. We hypothesize that the observed changes in information flow in the concussed group indicate functional reorganization of resting state networks in response to brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multivariate Analysis of Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reveals Transcriptomic Classification of de novo Glioblastoma Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00081</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma, the most frequent primary malignant brain neoplasm, is genetically diverse and classified into four transcriptomic subtypes, i. e., classical, mesenchymal, proneural, and neural. Currently, detection of transcriptomic subtype is based on ex vivo analysis of tissue that does not capture the spatial tumor heterogeneity. In view of accumulative evidence of in vivo imaging signatures summarizing molecular features of cancer, this study seeks robust non-invasive radiographic markers of transcriptomic classification of glioblastoma, based solely on routine clinically-acquired imaging sequences. A pre-operative retrospective cohort of 112 pathology-proven de novo glioblastoma patients, having multi-parametric MRI (T1, T1-Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR), collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were included. Following tumor segmentation into distinct radiographic sub-regions, diverse imaging features were extracted and support vector machines were employed to multivariately integrate these features and derive an imaging signature of transcriptomic subtype. Extracted features included intensity distributions, volume, morphology, statistics, tumors' anatomical location, and texture descriptors for each tumor sub-region. The derived signature was evaluated against the transcriptomic subtype of surgically-resected tissue specimens, using a 5-fold cross-validation method and a receiver-operating-characteristics analysis. The proposed model was 71% accurate in distinguishing among the four transcriptomic subtypes. The accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for distinguishing each subtype (classical, mesenchymal, proneural, neural) from the rest was equal to 88.4% (71.4/92.3), 75.9% (83.9/72.8), 82.1% (73.1/84.9), and 75.9% (79.4/74.4), respectively. The findings were also replicated in The Cancer Genomic Atlas glioblastoma dataset. The obtained imaging signature for the classical subtype was dominated by associations with features related to edge sharpness, whereas for the mesenchymal subtype had more pronounced presence of higher T2 and T2-FLAIR signal in edema, and higher volume of enhancing tumor and edema. The proneural and neural subtypes were characterized by the lower T1-Gd signal in enhancing tumor and higher T2-FLAIR signal in edema, respectively. Our results indicate that quantitative multivariate analysis of features extracted from clinically-acquired MRI may provide a radiographic biomarker of the transcriptomic profile of glioblastoma. Importantly our findings can be influential in surgical decision-making, treatment planning, and assessment of inoperable tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Single cell transcriptional signatures of the human placenta in term and preterm parturition</title>

	<description>More than 135 million births occur each year; yet, the molecular underpinnings of human parturition in gestational tissues, and in particular the placenta, are still poorly understood. The placenta is a complex heterogeneous organ including cells of both maternal and fetal origin, and insults that disrupt the maternal-fetal dialogue could result in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. There is limited knowledge of the cell type composition and transcriptional activity of the placenta and its compartments during physiologic and pathologic parturition. To fill this knowledge gap, we used scRNA-seq to profile the placental villous tree, basal plate, and chorioamniotic membranes of women with or without labor at term and those with preterm labor. Significant differences in cell type composition and transcriptional profiles were found among placental compartments and across study groups. For the first time, two cell types were identified: 1) lymphatic endothelial decidual cells in the chorioamniotic membranes, and 2) non-proliferative interstitial cytotrophoblasts in the placental villi. Maternal macrophages from the chorioamniotic membranes displayed the largest differences in gene expression (e.g. &lt;i&gt;NFKB1&lt;/i&gt;) in both processes of labor; yet, specific gene expression changes were also detected in preterm labor. Importantly, several placental scRNA-seq transcriptional signatures were modulated with advancing gestation in the maternal circulation, and specific immune cell type signatures were increased with labor at term (NK-cell and activated T-cell signatures) and with preterm labor (macrophage, monocyte, and activated T-cell signatures). Herein, we provide a catalogue of cell types and transcriptional profiles in the human placenta, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings and non-invasive prediction of the physiologic and pathologic parturition.</description>

	<description>Tcf7l2 mediates Wnt/β-Catenin signalling during development and is implicated in cancer and type-2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which Tcf7l2 and Wnt/β-Catenin signalling elicit such a diversity of biological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we study the function of zebrafish &lt;i&gt;tcf7l2&lt;/i&gt;alternative splice variants and show that only variants that include exon five or an analogous human &lt;i&gt;tcf7l2&lt;/i&gt; variant can effectively provide compensatory repressor function to restore eye formation in embryos lacking &lt;i&gt;tcf7l1a/tcf7l1b&lt;/i&gt; function. Knockdown of exon five specific &lt;i&gt;tcf7l2&lt;/i&gt; variants in &lt;i&gt;tcf7l1a&lt;/i&gt; mutants also compromises eye formation, and these variants can effectively repress Wnt pathway activity in reporter assays using Wnt target gene promoters. We show that the repressive activities of exon5-coded variants are likely explained by their interaction with Tle co-repressors. Furthermore, phosphorylated residues in Tcf7l2 coded exon5 facilitate repressor activity. Our studies suggest that developmentally regulated splicing of &lt;i&gt;tcf7l2&lt;/i&gt; can influence the transcriptional output of the Wnt pathway.</description>

	<description>Cardiac conduction defects decrease life expectancy in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a CTG repeat disorder involving misbalance between two RNA binding factors, MBNL1 and CELF1. However, how DM1 condition translates into conduction disorders remains poorly understood. Here we simulated MBNL1 and CELF1 misbalance in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; heart and performed TU-tagging-based RNAseq of cardiac cells. We detected deregulations of several genes controlling cellular calcium levels, including increased expression of straightjacket/α2δ3, which encodes a regulatory subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel. Straightjacket overexpression in the fly heart leads to asynchronous heartbeat, a hallmark of abnormal conduction, whereas cardiac straightjacket knockdown improves these symptoms in DM1 fly models. We also show that ventricular α2δ3 expression is low in healthy mice and humans, but significantly elevated in ventricular muscles from DM1 patients with conduction defects. These findings suggest that reducing ventricular straightjacket/α2δ3 levels could offer a strategy to prevent conduction defects in DM1.</description>

	<description>We develop magnetic resonance (MR) methods for real-time measurement of tissue microstructure and membrane permeability of live and fixed excised neonatal mouse spinal cords. Diffusion and exchange MR measurements are performed using the strong static gradient produced by a single-sided permanent magnet. Using tissue delipidation methods, we show that water diffusion is restricted solely by lipid membranes. Most of the diffusion signal can be assigned to water in tissue which is far from membranes. The remaining 25% can be assigned to water restricted on length scales of roughly a micron or less, near or within membrane structures at the cellular, organelle, and vesicle levels. Diffusion exchange spectroscopy measures water exchanging between membrane structures and free environments at 100 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</description>

	<description>Conserved proteins drive clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which from yeast to humans involves a burst of actin assembly. To gain mechanistic insights into this process, we performed a side-by-side quantitative comparison of CME in two distantly related yeast species. Though endocytic protein abundance in &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; is more similar than previously thought, membrane invagination speed and depth are two-fold greater in fission yeast. In both yeasts, accumulation of ~70 WASp molecules activates the Arp2/3 complex to drive membrane invagination. In contrast to budding yeast, WASp-mediated actin nucleation plays an essential role in fission yeast endocytosis. Genetics and live-cell imaging revealed core CME spatiodynamic similarities between the two yeasts, although the assembly of two zones of actin filaments is specific for fission yeast and not essential for CME. These studies identified conserved CME mechanisms and species-specific adaptations with broad implications that are expected to extend from yeast to humans.</description>

	<description>Human mutations in the dystroglycan complex (DGC) result in not only muscular dystrophy but also cognitive impairments. However, the molecular architecture critical for the synaptic organization of the DGC in neurons remains elusive. Here we report Inhibitory Synaptic protein 1 (InSyn1) is a critical component of the DGC whose loss alters the composition of the GABAergic synapses, excitatory/inhibitory balance &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and cognitive behavior. Association of InSyn1 with DGC subunits is required for InSyn1 synaptic localization. InSyn1 null neurons also show a significant reduction in DGC and GABA receptor distribution as well as abnormal neuronal network activity. Moreover, InSyn1 null mice exhibit elevated neuronal firing patterns in the hippocampus and deficits in fear conditioning memory. Our results support the dysregulation of the DGC at inhibitory synapses and altered neuronal network activity and specific cognitive tasks via loss of a novel component, InSyn1.</description>

	<description>Topographic representations of the peripheral sensory organs are a prominent feature of primary sensory areas in the cerebral cortex. In particular, the whisker representation in the primary somatosensory cortex of rodents is composed of spatially distinct 'barrel' columns, each corresponding to a different whisker on the snout. Although the relationship between the sensory coding properties of neurons and their position in the barrel map has been extensively studied, the functional role of cortical maps remains unclear. We hypothesize that the body map in the primary somatosensory cortex is a framework for the integration of sensory information into motor control. First, we trained head-fixed mice in a cortical closed-loop brain-machine interface task where learning necessitates the integration of sensory feedback. Second, we show that in this task a biomimetic, topographic organization of the sensory feedback is required for learning. Finally, we show that enhanced performance in the biomimetic feedback condition correlates with improved motor control. Overall our findings support the view that cortical maps are necessary for optimal cortical sensorimotor integration. They should therefore be fully considered when designing direct cortical feedback for brain-machine interfaces with clinical applications .</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cerebral artery segmentation based on magnetization-prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echo multi-contrast images in 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging</title>

	<description>Cerebral artery segmentation plays an important role in the direct visualization of the human brain to obtain vascular system information. At ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging, hyperintensity of the cerebral arteries in T1 weighted (T1w) images could be segmented from brain tissues such as gray and white matter. In this study, we propose an automated method to segment the cerebral arteries using multi-contrast images including T1w images of a magnetization-prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence at 7 T. The proposed method employed a seed-based region-growing strategy with the following procedures. (1) Two seed regions were defined by Frangi filtering applied to T1w images and by a simple calculation from multi-contrast images, (2) the two seed regions were combined, (3) the combined seed regions were expanded using a region growing algorithm to acquire the cerebral arteries. Time-of-flight (TOF) images were obtained as a reference to evaluate the proposed method. We successfully performed vessel segmentations from T1w MP2RAGE images, which mostly overlapped with the segmentations from the TOF images. As large arteries can affect the normalization of anatomical images to the standard coordinate space in functional and structural studies, we also investigated the effect of the cerebral arteries on spatial transformation using vessel segmentation by the proposed method. As a result, the T1w image removing the cerebral arteries showed better agreement with the standard atlas compared with the T1w image containing the arteries. Thus, because the proposed method using MP2RAGE images can obtain brain tissue anatomical information as well as cerebral artery information without need for additional acquisitions such as of the TOF sequence, it is useful and time saving for medical diagnosis and functional and structural studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Localization of immunoreactive, dystonia-associated protein torsinA near the Golgi apparatus of cultured rodent astrocytes</title>

	<description>An in-frame deletion of a single glutamic acid codon in the TOR1A gene causes the neurological disorder DYT1 dystonia, but the cellular pathophysiology of this disorder remains elusive. A current model postulates that the wild-type (WT) torsinA protein is mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but that the mutant form ({Delta}E-torsinA) is diverted to the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. This mis-localization has been observed by overexpressing the proteins in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. However, it is not clear whether this model is valid for the astrocytic glial cells that support and modify neuronal functions. Here we report, using rodent astrocytes in primary culture, that the overexpressed torsinA proteins were distributed as predicted by the mis-localization model. We also found by immunocytochemistry that the cultured astrocytes express torsinA endogenously. Most of the signals from endogenous protein, whether the WT or {Delta}E form, were localized near a cis-Golgi marker GM130. Such localization of endogenous proteins was found in glial cells from several sources: the hippocampus of WT rats, the hippocampus and striatum of WT mice, and the hippocampus and striatum of {Delta}E-torsinA knock-in mice, a model of DYT1 dystonia. These results show that the mis-localization model is applicable to overexpressed torsinA proteins, but not applicable to those expressed at endogenous levels, at least in cultured rodent astrocytes. These discrepancies in the distribution of overexpressed versus endogenous torsinA proteins highlight the potential need for caution in interpreting the results of overexpression studies.</description>

	<description>Using procedures optimized to explore network organization within the individual, the topography of a candidate language network was characterized and situated within the broader context of adjacent networks. The candidate network was first identified using functional connectivity and replicated across individuals, datasets, acquisition tasks, and analytic methods. In addition to classical language regions near to perisylvian cortex and temporal pole, additional regions were observed in dorsal posterior cingulate, midcingulate, anterior superior frontal and inferior temporal cortex. The candidate network was selectively activated when processing meaningful (as contrast to non-word) sentences, while spatially adjacent networks showed minimal or even decreased activity. Examined in relation to adjacent networks, the topography of the language network was found to parallel the motif of other association networks including the transmodal association networks linked to theory of mind and episodic remembering (often collectively called the default network). The several networks contained juxtaposed regions in multiple association zones. Outside of these juxtaposed higher-order networks, we further noted a distinct frontotemporal network situated between language regions and a frontal orofacial motor region and a temporal auditory region. A possibility is that these functionally-related sensorimotor regions might anchor specialization of neighboring association regions that develop into the language network. What is most striking is that the canonical language network appears to be just one of multiple similarly organized, differentially specialized distributed networks that populate the evolutionarily expanded zones of human association cortex.</description>

	<description>The efficient coding hypothesis posits that sensory circuits and animal behavior should be adapted to the statistical structure of natural signals. Here, we show that the perception of visual textures is adapted to the spatial distribution of light signals at a striking level of detail. We first identify a parametrized 66-dimensional space of grayscale textures defined by local spatial correlations between discrete light intensities. We then devise a method of measuring the contribution of each of these textures to the spatial structure of scenes. Efficient coding predicts that the perceptual salience of a complex sensory signal should be related to its variability in natural settings. Based on an analysis of contrast-equalized natural scenes, this theory predicts that textures involving two-point correlations will be most salient, and it further predicts the relative salience among second-order correlations of different types. We test our predictions by asking observers to locate a briefly-flashed texture strip in a background of white noise. The behavior of individual subjects is highly consistent: correlations beyond the second order are hard to distinguish from random noise, and detection thresholds within this salient second-order subspace are quantitatively predicted across 26 two-dimensional texture planes. We additionally find non-trivial symmetries of natural images that leave psychophysical thresholds unchanged, further supporting our hypothesis. These findings significantly extend previous results obtained for binary images, and they provide deeper insights into the relationship between natural signal statistics and human perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Microglia Clear Neuron-released α-Synuclein via Selective Autophagy and Prevent Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>Microglia maintain brain homeostasis by removing neuron-derived components such as myelin and cell debris. The evidence linking microglia to neurodegenerative diseases is growing, however, the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein we report a neuroprotective role for microglia in the clearance of neuron-released -synuclein. Neuronal -synuclein activates microglia, which in turn engulf -synuclein into autophagosomes for degradation via selective autophagy (termed Synucleinphagy). Synucleinphagy is initiated by the interaction of -synuclein with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which induces transcriptional upregulation of p62/SQSTM1 through the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway without causing TLR4 endocytosis. Induction of p62, an autophagy receptor, is necessary for the formation of -synuclein/ubiquitin-positive puncta that are degraded by autophagy. Finally, disruption of microglial autophagy in mice expressing human -synuclein promotes the accumulation of misfolded -synuclein and causes midbrain dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Our study thus identifies a novel neuroprotective function of microglia in the clearance of -synuclein via TLR4-NF-{kappa}B-p62 mediated Synucleinphagy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Localization of the signal of dystonia-associated protein torsinA near the Golgi apparatus in cultured central neurons</title>

	<description>A single in-frame deletion of a codon for a glutamic acid residue within the TOR1A gene is linked to the autosomal-dominant movement disorder DYT1 dystonia, a condition characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause abnormal posture. This gene encodes the protein torsinA, and the functions of both wild-type and mutant ({Delta}E-torsinA) forms remain poorly understood. Previous studies based on overexpression systems indicated that wild-type torsinA resides mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum but that {Delta}E-torsinA is localized to the nuclear envelope or intracellular inclusions. This mutation-associated mis-localization has been proposed to underlie at least a part of the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia. However, the subcellular localization of torsinA has not been extensively studied when expressed at the endogenous level. Here we report an immunocytochemical analysis of torsinA proteins in cultured mouse neurons from a {Delta}E-torsinA knock-in model of DYT1 dystonia, where torsinA proteins are not upregulated. In all examined neurons of wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mice, torsinA signal was found mainly near the Golgi apparatus, and only weakly in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. These results suggest that, in the absence of overexpression, torsinA proteins are localized near the Golgi apparatus and may influence cellular function involving the organelle.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The effect of left frontal resection on hand selection: a lesion-tractography study</title>

	<description>Strong right-hand preference on the population level is a uniquely human feature, although the neural basis for this is still not clearly defined. Recent behavioural and neuroimaging literature suggests that hand preference may be related to the orchestrated function and size of fronto-parietal white matter tracts bilaterally. Lesions to these tracts induced during tumour resection may provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis. In the present study, a cohort of seventeen neurosurgical patients with left hemisphere brain tumours were recruited to investigate whether resection of certain white matter tracts affects the choice of hand selected for the execution of a goal-directed task (assembly of jigsaw puzzles). Patients performed the puzzles, but also tests for basic motor ability, selective attention and visuo-constructional ability, preoperatively and one month after surgery. Diffusion tractography of fronto-parietal tracts (the superior longitudinal fasciculus) and the corticospinal tract were performed, to evaluate whether resection of tracts was significantly associated with changes in hand selection. A complementary atlas-based disconnectome analysis was also conducted. Results showed a shift in hand selection despite the absence of any motor or cognitive deficits, which was significantly associated with patients with frontal and parietal resections, compared with those with resections in other lobes. In particular, this effect was significantly associated with the resection of dorsal fronto-parietal white matter connections, but not with the ventral fronto-parietal tract. Dorsal white matter pathways contribute bilaterally, with specific lateralised competencies, to control of goal-directed hand movements. We show that unilateral lesions, by unbalancing the cooperation of the two hemispheres, can alter the choice of hand selected to accomplish movements.</description>

	<description>Intellectual disability (ID) found in Down syndrome (DS), which is characterized by an extra copy of 234 genes on Chr21 is poorly understood. We first used two DS mouse models that either display an extra copy of the Dyrk1A gene or of the mouse Chr16 syntenic region. Exome sequencing of transcripts deregulated in embryonic hippocampus uncovers enrichment in genes involved in chromatin and synapse respectively. Using large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen (154 distinct screens) of human brain library containing at least 107 independent fragments, we identified 3,636 novel protein-protein interactions with an enrichment of direct interactors of both Chromosome 21(Hsa21) baits and rebounds in ID-related genes. Using proximity ligation assays, we identified that Hsa21-encoded proteins are located at the dendritic spine postsynaptic density in a protein network located at the dendritic spine post synapse. Hsa21 DYRK1A and DSCAM that confers a ~ 20-fold increase in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are part of this dendritic spine postsynaptic network. We found that a DSCAM intracellular domain binds either DYRK1A or DLGs that are multimeric scaffolds for the clustering of receptors, ion channels, and associated signaling proteins. The DYRK1A-DSCAM interaction is conserved from drosophila to humans. The identified postsynaptic network is enriched in ARC-related synaptic plasticity, ASDs and Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease. Altogether, these results emphasize links between DS and brain diseases with complex genetics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Tracking attention in a visual active paradigm for the diagnosis of disorders of consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2019.12.11.872515v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2019.12.11.872515v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background - Clinical assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) relies on the clinician's ability to detect a behavioral response to an instruction (e.g., &quot;squeeze my hand&quot;). However, recent studies have shown that some of these patients can produce volitional brain responses to command while no behavioral response is present. This highlights the importance of developing motor-independent diagnostic tool for this population, complementing standardized behavioral evaluation. We here evaluate the ability of a novel gaze-independent attention-based EEG paradigm to detect volitional attentional processes in patients with disorders of consciousness. Methods - Thirty patients with DOC were included in the study: 12 with an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, 16 in a minimally conscious state (MCS), two who emerged from a MCS. Patients were randomly instructed to either concentrate on a task or rest while brain activity was recorded using EEG during a gaze-independent paradigm. Results - One of two EMCS, one of 16 MCS and one of 12 UWS patients showed a response to command using the attention task. Interestingly, this method could detect a brain-based response to command in one MCS patient who did not present a behavioral response to command at the bedside the day of the assessment. Conclusion - This study show that task-related variation of attention during an active task could help to objectively detect response to command in patients with DOC.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gut microbiome signatures of risk and prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease</title>

	<description>Objectives: Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they may be related to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition. Methods: Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial -/{beta}-diversity, enterotypes, and taxonomic composition in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants. Results: Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, constipation and age showed associations with - and {beta}-diversity, and for both measures subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed interaction effects. Moreover, male sex, possible REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), smoking as well as body-mass-index, antidiabetic and urate-lowering medication were associated with {beta}-diversity. Physical inactivity and constipation severity were increased in individuals with the Firmicutes-enriched enterotype. Subthreshold parkinsonism was least frequently observed in individuals with the Prevotella-enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the overall prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations. Interpretation: Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with changes in gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome-dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.</description>

	<description>Semantic composition, i.e. the ability to combine single words to form complex meanings, is a core feature of human language. Despite growing interest in the basis of semantic composition, the neural correlates and the interaction of regions within this network remain a matter of debate. In the present fMRI study, we designed a well controlled two-word paradigm in which phrases only differed along the semantic dimension while keeping syntactic information alike. Healthy participants listened to meaningful phrases (fresh apple), anomalous phrases (awake apple) and pseudoword phrases (awake gufel) while performing both an implicit and an explicit semantic task. We identified neural signatures for distinct processes at work during basic semantic composition: The general phrasal composition process, which is independent of the plausibility of the resulting phrase, engages a wide-spread left hemispheric network comprising both executive semantic control regions as well as general conceptual representation regions. Within this network, the functional connectivity between the left anterior inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral presupplementary motor area and the posterior angular gyrus specifically increases during the processing of meaningful phrases. The anterior angular gyrus, on the other hand, guides more specific compositional processing evaluating phrasal plausibility. Overall, we provide a separation between distinct nodes of the semantic network, whose functional contributions depend on the type of compositional process under analysis. For the first time, we show that the angular gyrus may be decomposable into two sub-regions during semantic composition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Analysis of brain atrophy and local gene expression implicates astrocytes in Frontotemporal dementia</title>

	<description>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes. Despite progress in understanding which genes are associated with the aetiology of FTD (C9orf72, GRN and MAPT), the biological basis of how mutations in these genes lead to cell loss in specific cortical regions remains unclear. In this work we combined gene expression data for 16,912 genes from the Allen Institute for Brain Science atlas with brain maps of gray matter atrophy in symptomatic C9orf72, GRN and MAPT carriers obtained from the Genetic FTD Initiative study. A set of 405 and 250 genes showed significant positive and negative correlation, respectively, with atrophy patterns in all three maps. The gene set with increased expression in spared cortical regions, i.e., signaling regional resilience to atrophy, is enriched for neuronal genes, while the gene set with increased expression in atrophied regions, i.e., signaling regional vulnerability, is enriched for astrocyte genes. Notably, these results extend earlier findings from proteomic analyses in the same cortical regions of interest comparing healthy controls and patients with FTD. Thus, our analysis indicates that cortical regions showing the most severe atrophy in genetic FTD are those with the highest astrocyte density in healthy subjects. Therefore, astrocytes may play a more active role in the onset of neurodegeneration in FTD than previously assumed, e.g., through emergence of neurotoxic (A1) astrocytes.</description>

Apoptosis is an essential defensive mechanism against tumorigenesis. Proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family regulate programmed cell death by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In response to intracellular stress, the apoptotic balance is governed by interactions of three distinct subgroups of proteins; the activator/sensitizer BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only proteins, the pro-survival, and the pro-apoptotic executioner proteins. Changes in expression levels, stability, and functional impairment of pro-survival proteins can lead to an imbalance in tissue homeostasis. Their overexpression or hyperactivation can result in oncogenic effects. Pro-survival Bcl-2 family members carry out their function by binding the BH3 short linear motif of pro-apoptotic proteins in a modular way, creating a complex network of protein-protein interactions. Their dysfunction enables cancer cells to evade cell death. The critical role of Bcl-2 proteins in homeostasis and tumorigenesis, coupled with mounting insight in their structural properties, make them therapeutic targets of interest. A better understanding of gene expression, mutational profile, and molecular mechanisms of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in different cancer types, could help to clarify their role in cancer development and may guide advancement in drug discovery. Here, we shed light on the pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in breast cancer using different bioinformatic approaches, linking -omics with structural data. We analyzed the changes in the expression of the Bcl-2 proteins and their BH3-containing interactors in breast cancer samples. We then studied, at the structural level, a selection of interactions, accounting for effects induced by mutations found in the breast cancer samples. We find two complexes between the up-regulated Bcl2A1 and two down-regulated BH3-only candidates (i.e., Hrk and Nr4a1) as targets associated with reduced apoptosis in breast cancer samples for future experimental validation. Furthermore, we predict L99R, M75R as damaging mutations altering protein stability, and Y120C as a possible allosteric mutation from an exposed surface to the BH3-binding site.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3aCKPvqFGNw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single and collective cell dynamics, cell shape changes, and cell migration can be conveniently represented by the Cellular Potts Model, a computational platform based on minimization of a Hamiltonian. Using the fact that a force field is easily derived from a scalar energy (F = −∇&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;), we develop a simple algorithm to associate effective forces with cell shapes in the CPM. We predict the traction forces exerted by single cells of various shapes and sizes on a 2D substrate. While CPM forces are specified directly from the Hamiltonian on the cell perimeter, we approximate the force field inside the cell domain using interpolation, and refine the results with smoothing. Predicted forces compare favorably with experimentally measured cellular traction forces. We show that a CPM model with internal signaling (such as Rho-GTPase-related contractility) can be associated with retraction-protrusion forces that accompany cell shape changes and migration. We adapt the computations to multicellular systems, showing, for example, the forces that a pair of swirling cells exert on one another, demonstrating that our algorithm works equally well for interacting cells. Finally, we show forces exerted by cells on one another in classic cell-sorting experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oga0uLiqSUE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Exposing Pathological Sensory Predictions in Tinnitus Using Auditory Intensity Deviant Evoked Responses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We tested the popular, unproven theory that tinnitus is caused by resetting of auditory predictions toward a persistent low-intensity sound. Electroencephalographic mismatch negativity responses, which quantify the violation of sensory predictions, to unattended tinnitus-like sounds were greater in response to upward than downward intensity deviants in 26 unselected chronic tinnitus subjects with normal to severely impaired hearing, and in 15 acute tinnitus subjects, but not in 26 hearing and age-matched controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, receiver operator characteristic, area under the curve, 0.77), or in 20 healthy and hearing-impaired controls presented with simulated tinnitus. The findings support a prediction resetting model of tinnitus generation, and may form the basis of a convenient tinnitus biomarker, which we name Intensity Mismatch Asymmetry, which is usable across species, is quick and tolerable, and requires no training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In current models, perception is based around the generation of internal predictions of the environment, which are tested and updated using evidence from the senses. Here, we test the theory that auditory phantom perception (tinnitus) occurs when a default auditory prediction is formed to explain spontaneous activity in the subcortical pathway, rather than ignoring it as noise. We find that chronic tinnitus patients show an abnormal pattern of evoked responses to unexpectedly loud and quiet sounds that both supports this hypothesis and provides fairly accurate classification of tinnitus status at the individual subject level. This approach to objectively demonstrating the predictions underlying pathological perceptual states may also have a much wider utility, for instance, in chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurovascular Coupling under Chronic Stress Is Modified by Altered GABAergic Interneuron Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurovascular coupling (NVC), the interaction between neural activity and vascular response, ensures normal brain function by maintaining brain homeostasis. We previously reported altered cerebrovascular responses during functional hyperemia in chronically stressed animals. However, the underlying neuronal-level changes associated with those hemodynamic changes remained unclear. Here, using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments, we investigate the neuronal origins of altered NVC dynamics under chronic stress conditions in adult male mice. Stimulus-evoked hemodynamic and neural responses, especially beta and gamma-band local field potential activity, were significantly lower in chronically stressed animals, and the NVC relationship, itself, had changed. Further, using acute brain slices, we discovered that the underlying cause of this change was dysfunction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-mediated vascular responses. Using FISH to check the mRNA expression of several GABAergic subtypes, we confirmed that only nNOS mRNA was significantly decreased in chronically stressed mice. Ultimately, chronic stress impairs NVC by diminishing nNOS-mediated vasodilation responses to local neural activity. Overall, these findings provide useful information in understanding NVC dynamics in the healthy brain. More importantly, this study reveals that impaired nNOS-mediated NVC function may be a contributory factor in the progression of stress-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The correlation between neuronal activity and cerebral vascular dynamics is defined as neurovascular coupling (NVC), which plays an important role for meeting the metabolic demands of the brain. However, the impact of chronic stress, which is a contributory factor of many cerebrovascular diseases, on NVC is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effects of chronic stress on impaired neurovascular response to sensory stimulation and their underlying mechanisms. Multimodal approaches, from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; hemodynamic imaging and electrophysiology to &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; vascular imaging with pharmacological treatment, patch-clamp recording, FISH, and immunohistochemistry revealed that chronic stress-induced dysfunction of nNOS-expressing interneurons contributes to NVC impairment. These findings will provide useful information to understand the role of nNOS interneurons in NVC in normal and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Claustrum-Prefrontal Cortex Pathway Regulates Impulsive-Like Behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The claustrum connects with a broad range of cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the function of the claustrum (CLA) and its neural projections remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidated the role of the neural projections from the CLA to the PFC in regulating impulsivity in male rats. We first identified the CLA–PFC pathway by retrograde tracer and virus expression. By using immunofluorescent staining of the c-Fos-positive neurons, we showed that chemogenetic activation and inhibition of the CLA–PFC pathway reduced and increased overall activity of the PFC, respectively. In the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), we found that chemogenetic activation and inhibition of the CLA–PFC pathway increased and reduced the impulsive-like behavior (i.e., premature responses), respectively. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of the CLA–PFC pathway prevented methamphetamine-induced impulsivity, without affecting methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity. In contrast to the role of CLA–PFC pathway in selectively regulating impulsivity, activation of the claustrum disrupted attention in the 5-CSRTT. These results indicate that the CLA–PFC pathway is essential for impulsivity. This study may shed light on the understanding of impulsivity-related disorders such as drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The claustrum is one of the most mysterious brain regions. Although extensive anatomical studies demonstrated that the claustrum connects with many cortical areas, the function of the neural projections between the claustrum and cortical areas remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that the neural projections from the claustrum to the prefrontal cortex regulates impulsivity by using the designer drugs (DREADDs)-based chemogenetic tools. Interestingly, the claustrum–prefrontal cortex pathway also regulates methamphetamine-induced impulsivity, suggesting a critical role of this neural pathway in regulating impulsivity-related disorders such as drug addiction. Our results provided preclinical evidence that the claustrum-prefrontal cortex regulates impulsivity. The claustrum–prefrontal cortex pathway may be a novel target for the treatment of impulsivity-related brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical layer 1 (L1) contains a sparse and molecularly distinct population of inhibitory interneurons. Their location makes them ideally suited for affecting computations involving long-range corticocortical and subcortical inputs, yet their response properties remain largely unexplored. Here we attempt to characterize some of the functional properties of these neurons in the primary visual cortex of awake mice. We find that the strongest driver of L1 neuron activity is locomotion, with at least half of L1 neurons displaying locomotion-related activity. Visual responses are present in a similar fraction of neurons, but these responses are weaker and frequently suppressive. We also find that ~43% of L1 neurons respond to noise stimuli and at least 14% respond to whisker touch, with these two populations being statistically independent. Finally, we find that 45% of L1 neurons have generally weak responses correlated with whisking activity. Overall, the spatial distributions of modality-specific responses were more or less random. Our work helps to establish the basic sensory- and motor-related responses of L1 interneurons, revealing several previously unreported characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortical processing even in primary sensory areas is strongly influenced by nonlocal corticocortical and neuromodulatory inputs. Many of these inputs are known to converge onto layer 1 where they target not only distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons but also a sparse population of inhibitory neurons. Previous studies have suggested that layer 1 neurons may play a crucial role in mediating the effects of these long-range projections, but the different types of inputs have mostly been studied in isolation. Here, we take a closer look at the response properties of layer 1 neurons in mouse visual cortex, examining both their visual properties, likely caused by direct thalamocortical inputs, and other sensory and motor properties, likely reflecting corticocortical and neuromodulatory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tinnitus Correlates with Downregulation of Cortical Glutamate Decarboxylase 65 Expression But Not Auditory Cortical Map Reorganization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is the biggest risk factor for tinnitus, and hearing-loss-related pathological changes in the auditory pathway have been hypothesized as the mechanism underlying tinnitus. However, due to the comorbidity of tinnitus and hearing loss, it has been difficult to differentiate between neural correlates of tinnitus and consequences of hearing loss. In this study, we dissociated tinnitus and hearing loss in FVB mice, which exhibit robust resistance to tinnitus following monaural noise-induced hearing loss. Furthermore, knock-down of glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) expression in auditory cortex (AI) by RNA interference gave rise to tinnitus in normal-hearing FVB mice. We found that tinnitus was significantly correlated with downregulation of GAD65 in the AI. By contrast, cortical map distortions, which have been hypothesized as a mechanism underlying tinnitus, were correlated with hearing loss but not tinnitus. Our findings suggest new strategies for the rehabilitation of tinnitus and other phantom sensation, such as phantom pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hearing loss is the biggest risk factor for tinnitus in humans. Most animal models of tinnitus also exhibit comorbid hearing loss, making it difficult to dissociate the mechanisms underlying tinnitus from mere consequences of hearing loss. Here we show that, although both C57BL/6 and FVB mice exhibited similar noise-induced hearing threshold increase, only C57BL/6, but not FVB, mice developed tinnitus following noise exposure. Although both strains showed frequency map reorganization following noise-induced hearing loss, only C57BL/6 mice had reduced glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) expression in the auditory cortex (AI). Knocking down GAD65 expression in the AI resulted in tinnitus in normal-hearing FVB mice. Our results suggest that reduced inhibitory neuronal function, but not sensory map reorganization, underlies noise-induced tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Changes in Ultrastructure of the Primary Cilium in Migrating Neuroblasts in the Postnatal Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/9967?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;New neurons, referred to as neuroblasts, are continuously generated in the ventricular-subventricular zone of the brain throughout an animal's life. These neuroblasts are characterized by their unique potential for proliferation, formation of chain-like cell aggregates, and long-distance and high-speed migration through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) toward the olfactory bulb (OB), where they decelerate and differentiate into mature interneurons. The dynamic changes of ultrastructural features in postnatal-born neuroblasts during migration are not yet fully understood. Here we report the presence of a primary cilium, and its ultrastructural morphology and spatiotemporal dynamics, in migrating neuroblasts in the postnatal RMS and OB. The primary cilium was observed in migrating neuroblasts in the postnatal RMS and OB in male and female mice and zebrafish, and a male rhesus monkey. Inhibition of intraflagellar transport molecules in migrating neuroblasts impaired their ciliogenesis and rostral migration toward the OB. Serial section transmission electron microscopy revealed that each migrating neuroblast possesses either a pair of centrioles or a basal body with an immature or mature primary cilium. Using immunohistochemistry, live imaging, and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the localization and orientation of the primary cilium are altered depending on the mitotic state, saltatory migration, and deceleration of neuroblasts. Together, our results highlight a close mutual relationship between spatiotemporal regulation of the primary cilium and efficient chain migration of neuroblasts in the postnatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Immature neurons (neuroblasts) generated in the postnatal brain have a mitotic potential and migrate in chain-like cell aggregates toward the olfactory bulb. Here we report that migrating neuroblasts possess a tiny cellular protrusion called a primary cilium. Immunohistochemical studies with zebrafish, mouse, and monkey brains suggest that the presence of the primary cilium in migrating neuroblasts is evolutionarily conserved. Ciliogenesis in migrating neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream is suppressed during mitosis and promoted after cell cycle exit. Moreover, live imaging and 3D electron microscopy revealed that ciliary localization and orientation change during saltatory movement of neuroblasts. Our results reveal highly organized dynamics in maturation and positioning of the primary cilium during neuroblast migration that underlie saltatory movement of postnatal-born neuroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phosphorylation of TRPV1 S801 Contributes to Modality-Specific Hyperalgesia in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/9954?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective cationic channel activated by painful stimuli such as capsaicin and noxious heat, and enriched in sensory neurons of the pain pathway. During inflammation, chemical mediators activate protein kinases (such as PKC) that phosphorylate TRPV1 and thereby enhance its function, with consequent increases in nociceptor sensitization. However, the causal relationships between TRPV1 phosphorylation and pathological pain remain unexplored. To directly investigate the roles of one specific TRPV1 phosphorylation event &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we genetically altered a major PKC phosphorylation site, mouse TRPV1 S801, to alanine. The TRPV1 expression pattern in sensory neurons of S801A knock-in (KI) mice was comparable to that in WT controls. However, sensitization of capsaicin-mediated currents after the activation of PKC was substantially impaired in sensory neurons from KI mice. Thermal hyperalgesia induced by PMA or burn injury in KI was identical to WT. Inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia was only marginally attenuated in KI mice. In contrast, PMA-evoked nocifensive responses and sensitization of capsaicin responses were significantly attenuated in the hindpaws of KI mice. Ongoing pain from inflamed masseter muscle was also reduced in KI mice, and was further inhibited by the TRPV1 antagonist AMG9810. These results suggest that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 S801 contributes to inflammation-mediated sensitization of TRPV1 to ligand, but not heat, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Further, this suggests that interference with TRPV1 S801 phosphorylation might represent one potential way to attenuate inflammatory pain, yet spare basal sensitivity and produce fewer side effects than more general TRPV1 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) has been considered a potential target for pain intervention. Global inhibitors of TRPV1 function, however, produce side effects which could compromise their clinical utility. By precisely removing a unique PKC phosphorylation site (TRPV1 S801) in mice through CRISPR/Cas9 editing, we provide &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence for a highly specific inhibition that leaves basal TRPV1 function intact, yet alleviates some forms of hyperalgesia. These findings support inhibition of TRPV1 S801 phosphorylation as a potential intervention for pain management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Iron Metabolism in the Peripheral Nervous System: The Role of DMT1, Ferritin, and Transferrin Receptor in Schwann Cell Maturation and Myelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/9940?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Iron is an essential cofactor for many cellular enzymes involved in myelin synthesis, and iron homeostasis unbalance is a central component of peripheral neuropathies. However, iron absorption and management in the PNS are poorly understood. To study iron metabolism in Schwann cells (SCs), we have created 3 inducible conditional KO mice in which three essential proteins implicated in iron uptake and storage, the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), the ferritin heavy chain (Fth), and the transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1), were postnatally ablated specifically in SCs. Deleting DMT1, Fth, or Tfr1 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; significantly reduce SC proliferation, maturation, and the myelination of DRG axons. This was accompanied by an important reduction in iron incorporation and storage. When these proteins were KO &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; during the first postnatal week, the sciatic nerve of all 3 conditional KO animals displayed a significant reduction in the synthesis of myelin proteins and in the percentage of myelinated axons. Knocking out Fth produced the most severe phenotype, followed by DMT1 and, last, Tfr1. Importantly, DMT1 as well as Fth KO mice showed substantial motor coordination deficits. In contrast, deleting these proteins in mature myelinating SCs results in milder phenotypes characterized by small reductions in the percentage of myelinated axons and minor changes in the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-ratio of myelinated axons. These results indicate that DMT1, Fth, and Tfr1 are critical proteins for early postnatal iron uptake and storage in SCs and, as a consequence, for the normal myelination of the PNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To determine the function of the divalent metal transporter 1, the transferrin receptor 1, and the ferritin heavy chain in Schwann cell (SC) maturation and myelination, we created 3 conditional KO mice in which these proteins were postnatally deleted in Sox10-positive SCs. We have established that these proteins are necessary for normal SC iron incorporation and storage, and, as a consequence, for an effective myelination of the PNS. Since iron is indispensable for SC maturation, understanding iron metabolism in SCs is an essential prerequisite for developing therapies for demyelinating diseases in the PNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intermittent Failure of Spike Propagation in Primary Afferent Neurons during Tactile Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/9927?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Primary afferent neurons convey somatosensory information to the CNS. Low-threshold mechanoreceptors are classified as slow-adapting (SA) or rapid-adapting (RA) based on whether or not they spike repetitively during sustained tactile stimulation; the former are subclassified as Type 1 or 2 based on the regularity of their spiking. Recording &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; from DRGs of mice, we observed irregular- and regular-spiking units consistent with SA1 and SA2 low-threshold mechanoreceptors, but some units, which we labeled &quot;semiregular,&quot; did not fit cleanly into the existing classification scheme. Analysis of their spiking revealed integer-multiple patterning in which spike trains comprised a fundamental interspike interval and multiples thereof. Integer-multiple-patterned spiking was reproduced by randomly removing spikes from an otherwise regular spike train, suggesting that semiregular units represent SA2 units in which some spikes are &quot;missing.&quot; We hypothesized that missing spikes arose from intermittent failure of spikes to initiate or to propagate. Intermittent failure of spike initiation was ruled out by several observations: integer-multiple-patterned spiking was not induced by intradermal lidocaine, was independent of stimulus modality (mechanical vs optogenetic), and could not be reproduced in a conductance-based model neuron given constant input. On the other hand, integer-multiple-patterned spiking was induced by application of lidocaine to the DRG, thus pinpointing intermittent failure of spike propagation as the basis for integer-multiple-patterned spiking. Indeed, half of all SA2 units exhibited some missing spikes, mostly at low rate (&amp;lt;5%), which suggests that axons are efficient in using the lowest safety factor capable of producing near-perfect propagation reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The impedance mismatch at axon branch points can impede spike propagation. Reliability of spike propagation across branch points remains an open question and is especially important for primary afferents whose spikes must cross a T-junction to reach the CNS. Past research on propagation reliability has relied almost entirely on simulations and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Here, recording &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we linked a distinctive pattern of spiking to the intermittent failure of spike propagation at the T-junction. The rarity of failures argues that safety factor is high under physiological conditions, yet the occurrence of such failures argues that safety factor is just high enough to ensure near-perfect reliability, consistent with a good balance between propagation reliability and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Kinase A-Mediated Suppression of the Slow Afterhyperpolarizing KCa3.1 Current in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/9914?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain insults, such as trauma, stroke, anoxia, and status epilepticus (SE), cause multiple changes in synaptic function and intrinsic properties of surviving neurons that may lead to the development of epilepsy. Experimentally, a single SE episode, induced by the convulsant pilocarpine, initiates the development of an epileptic condition resembling human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Principal hippocampal neurons from such epileptic animals display enhanced spike output in response to excitatory stimuli compared with neurons from nonepileptic animals. This enhanced firing is negatively related to the size of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP), which is reduced in the epileptic neurons. The sAHP is an intrinsic neuronal negative feedback mechanism consisting normally of two partially overlapping components produced by disparate mechanisms. One component is generated by activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) channels, likely KCa3.1, consequent to spike Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx (the K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;-sAHP component). The second component is generated by enhancement of the electrogenic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase (NKA) by spike Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx (NKA-sAHP component). Here we show that the K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;-sAHP component is markedly reduced in male rat epileptic neurons, whereas the NKA-sAHP component is not altered. The K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;-sAHP reduction is due to the downregulation of KCa3.1 channels, mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). This sustained effect can be acutely reversed by applying PKA inhibitors, leading also to normalization of the spike output of epileptic neurons. We propose that the novel &quot;acquired channelopathy&quot; described here, namely, PKA-mediated downregulation of KCa3.1 activity, provides an innovative target for developing new treatments for TLE, hopefully overcoming the pharmacoresistance to traditional drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder, often develops following a brain insult. Identifying key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying acquired epilepsy is critical for developing effective antiepileptic therapies. In an experimental model of acquired epilepsy, we show that principal hippocampal neurons become intrinsically hyperexcitable. This alteration is due predominantly to the downregulation of a ubiquitous class of potassium ion channels, KCa3.1, whose main function is to dampen neuronal excitability. KCa3.1 downregulation is mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Most importantly, it can be acutely reversed by PKA inhibitors, leading to recovery of KCa3.1 function and normalization of neuronal excitability. The discovery of this novel epileptogenic mechanism hopefully will facilitate the development of more efficient pharmacotherapy for acquired epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hydrogen Peroxide Gates a Voltage-Dependent Cation Current in Aplysia Neuroendocrine Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nonselective cation channels promote persistent spiking in many neurons from a diversity of animals. In the hermaphroditic marine-snail, &lt;i&gt;Aplysia californica&lt;/i&gt;, synaptic input to the neuroendocrine bag cell neurons triggers various cation channels, causing an ~30 min afterdischarge of action potentials and the secretion of egg-laying hormone. During the afterdischarge, protein kinase C is also activated, which in turn elevates hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), likely by stimulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. The present study investigated whether H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regulates cation channels to drive the afterdischarge. In single, cultured bag cell neurons, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elicited a prolonged, concentration- and voltage-dependent inward current, associated with an increase in membrane conductance and a reversal potential of ~+30 mV. Compared with normal saline, the presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-free, or Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free extracellular saline, lowered the current amplitude and left-shifted the reversal potential, consistent with a nonselective cationic conductance. Preventing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with the glutathione peroxidase inhibitor, mercaptosuccinate, enhanced the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced current, while boosting glutathione production with its precursor, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine, or adding the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, lessened the response. Moreover, the current generated by the alkylating agent, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide, occluded the effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced current was inhibited by tetrodotoxin as well as the cation channel blockers, 9-phenanthrol and clotrimazole. In current-clamp, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stimulated burst firing, but this was attenuated or prevented altogether by the channel blockers. Finally, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evoked an afterdischarge from whole bag cell neuron clusters recorded &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; by sharp-electrode. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may regulate a cation channel to influence long-term changes in activity and ultimately reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is often studied in a pathological context, such as ischemia or inflammation. However, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also physiologically modulates synaptic transmission and gates certain transient receptor potential channels. That stated, the effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on neuronal excitability remains less well defined. Here, we examine how H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; influences &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; bag cell neurons, which elicit ovulation by releasing hormones during an afterdischarge. These neuroendocrine cells are uniquely identifiable and amenable to recording as individual cultured neurons or a cluster from the nervous system. In both culture and the cluster, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evokes prolonged, afterdischarge-like bursting by gating a nonselective voltage-dependent cationic current. Thus, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is generated in response to afterdischarge-associated second messengers, may prompt the firing necessary for hormone secretion and procreation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite dynamic inputs, neuronal circuits maintain relatively stable firing rates over long periods. This maintenance of firing rate, or firing rate homeostasis, is likely mediated by homeostatic mechanisms such as synaptic scaling and regulation of intrinsic excitability. Because some of these homeostatic mechanisms depend on transcription of activity-regulated genes, including &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Homer1a&lt;/i&gt;, we hypothesized that activity-regulated transcription would be required for firing rate homeostasis. Surprisingly, however, we found that cultured mouse cortical neurons from both sexes grown on multi-electrode arrays homeostatically adapt their firing rates to persistent pharmacological stimulation even when activity-regulated transcription is disrupted. Specifically, we observed firing rate homeostasis in &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; knock-out neurons, as well as knock-out neurons lacking the activity-regulated transcription factors AP1 and SRF. Firing rate homeostasis also occurred normally during acute pharmacological blockade of transcription. Thus, firing rate homeostasis in response to increased neuronal activity can occur in the absence of neuronal-activity-regulated transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal circuits maintain relatively stable firing rates even in the face of dynamic circuit inputs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that enable this firing rate homeostasis could potentially provide insight into neuronal diseases that present with an imbalance of excitation and inhibition. It has long been proposed that activity-regulated transcription could underlie firing rate homeostasis because activity-regulated genes turn on when neurons are above their target firing rates and include many genes that could regulate firing rate. Surprisingly, despite this prediction, we found that cortical neurons can undergo firing rate homeostasis in the absence of activity-regulated transcription, indicating that firing rate homeostasis can be controlled by non-transcriptional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;salience network&quot; refers to a suite of brain regions whose cortical hubs are the anterior cingulate and ventral anterior insular (i.e., frontoinsular) cortices. This network, which also includes nodes in the amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral striatum, thalamus, and specific brainstem nuclei, coactivates in response to diverse experimental tasks and conditions, suggesting a domain-general function. In the 12 years since its initial description, the salience network has been extensively studied, using diverse methods, concepts, and mammalian species, including healthy and diseased humans across the lifespan. Despite this large and growing body of research, the essential functions of the salience network remain uncertain. In this paper, which makes no attempt to comprehensively review this literature, I describe the circumstances surrounding the initial discovery, conceptualization, and naming of the salience network, highlighting aspects that may be unfamiliar to many readers. I then discuss some of the key advances provided by subsequent research and conclude by posing a few of the questions that remain to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Waking States for Strong Evoked Responses in Primary Visual Cortex and Optimal Visual Detection Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/10044?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Variability in cortical neuronal responses to sensory stimuli and in perceptual decision making performance is substantial. Moment-to-moment fluctuations in waking state or arousal can account for much of this variability. Yet, this variability is rarely characterized across the full spectrum of waking states, leaving the characteristics of the optimal state for sensory processing unresolved. Using pupillometry in concert with extracellular multiunit and intracellular whole-cell recordings, we found that the magnitude and reliability of visually evoked responses in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, passively behaving male mice increase as a function of arousal and are largest during sustained locomotion periods. During these high-arousal, sustained locomotion periods, cortical neuronal membrane potential was at its most depolarized and least variable. Contrastingly, behavioral performance of mice on two distinct visual detection tasks was generally best at a range of intermediate arousal levels, but worst during high arousal with locomotion. These results suggest that large, reliable responses to visual stimuli in V1 occur at a distinct arousal level from that associated with optimal visual detection performance. Our results clarify the relation between neuronal responsiveness and the continuum of waking states, and suggest new complexities in the relation between primary sensory cortical activity and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortical sensory processing strongly depends on arousal. In the mouse visual system, locomotion (associated with high arousal) has previously been shown to enhance the sensory responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, arousal fluctuates on a moment-to-moment basis, even during quiescent periods. The characteristics of V1 sensory processing across the continuum of arousal are unclear. Furthermore, the arousal level corresponding to optimal visual detection performance is unknown. We show that the magnitude and reliability of sensory-evoked V1 responses are monotonic increasing functions of arousal, and largest during locomotion. Visual detection behavior, however, is suboptimal during high arousal with locomotion, and usually best during intermediate arousal. Our study provides a more complete picture of the dependence of V1 sensory processing on arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pulsed Facilitation of Corticospinal Excitability by the Sensorimotor {mu}-Alpha Rhythm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/10034?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/10034?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alpha oscillations (8–14 Hz) are assumed to gate information flow in the brain by means of pulsed inhibition; that is, the phasic suppression of cortical excitability and information processing once per alpha cycle, resulting in stronger net suppression for larger alpha amplitudes due to the assumed amplitude asymmetry of the oscillation. While there is evidence for this hypothesis regarding occipital alpha oscillations, it is less clear for the central sensorimotor μ-alpha rhythm. Probing corticospinal excitability via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex and the measurement of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), we have previously demonstrated that corticospinal excitability is modulated by both amplitude and phase of the sensorimotor μ-alpha rhythm. However, the direction of this modulation, its proposed asymmetry, and its underlying mechanisms remained unclear. We therefore used real-time EEG-triggered single- and paired-pulse TMS in healthy humans of both sexes to assess corticospinal excitability and GABA-A-receptor mediated short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) at rest during spontaneous high amplitude μ-alpha waves at different phase angles (peaks, troughs, rising and falling flanks) and compared them to periods of low amplitude (desynchronized) μ-alpha. MEP amplitude was facilitated during troughs and rising flanks, but no phasic suppression was observed at any time, nor any modulation of SICI. These results are best compatible with sensorimotor μ-alpha reflecting asymmetric pulsed facilitation but not pulsed inhibition of motor cortical excitability. The asymmetric excitability with respect to rising and falling flanks of the μ-alpha cycle further reveals that voltage differences alone cannot explain the impact of phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pulsed inhibition hypothesis, which assumes that alpha oscillations actively inhibit neuronal processing in a phasic manner, is highly influential and has substantially shaped our understanding of these oscillations. However, some of its basic assumptions, in particular its asymmetry and inhibitory nature, have rarely been tested directly. Here, we explicitly investigated the asymmetry of modulation and its direction for the human sensorimotor μ-alpha rhythm. We found clear evidence of pulsed facilitation, but not inhibition, in the human motor cortex, challenging the generalizability of the pulsed inhibition hypothesis and advising caution when interpreting sensorimotor μ-alpha changes in the sensorimotor system. This study also demonstrates how specific assumptions about the neurophysiological underpinnings of cortical oscillations can be experimentally tested noninvasively in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multiple Timescales Account for Adaptive Responses across Sensory Cortices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/50/10019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems encounter remarkably diverse stimuli in the external environment. Natural stimuli exhibit timescales and amplitudes of variation that span a wide range. Mechanisms of adaptation, a ubiquitous feature of sensory systems, allow for the accommodation of this range of scales. Are there common rules of adaptation across different sensory modalities? We measured the membrane potential responses of individual neurons in the visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortices of male and female mice to discrete, punctate stimuli delivered at a wide range of fixed and nonfixed frequencies. We find that the adaptive profile of the response is largely preserved across these three areas, exhibiting attenuation and responses to the cessation of stimulation, which are signatures of response to changes in stimulus statistics. We demonstrate that these adaptive responses can emerge from a simple model based on the integration of fixed filters operating over multiple time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our recent sensations affect our current expectations and perceptions of the environment. Neural correlates of this process exist throughout the brain and are loosely termed adaptation. Adaptive processes have been described across sensory cortices, but direct comparisons of these processes have not been possible because paradigms have been tailored specifically for each modality. We developed a common stimulus set that was used to characterize adaptation in somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortex. We describe here the similarities and differences in adaptation across these cortical areas and demonstrate that adaptive responses may emerge from a set of static filters that operate over a broad range of timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Probing proteostatic stress in degenerating photoreceptors using two complementary in vivo reporters of proteasomal activity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal degenerations originate from mutations in &amp;gt;300 genes, many of which cause the production of misfolded mutant photoreceptor proteins that are ultimately degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). It was previously shown that rod photoreceptors in multiple mouse models of retinal degeneration suffer from proteostatic stress consisting of an insufficient cellular capacity for degrading UPS substrates. In this study, we focused on a specific UPS component required for the degradation of a subset of proteasome targets: the substrate-processing complex formed by the AAA+ ATPase P97/VCP and associated cofactors. To assess whether P97 capacity may be insufficient in degenerating rods, we employed two complementary &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; proteasomal activity reporters whose degradation is either P97-dependent or P97-independent. Retinal accumulation of each reporter was measured in two models of retinal degeneration: the transducin &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-subunit knockout (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and P23H rhodopsin knockin (P23H) mice. Strikingly, the patterns of reporter accumulation differed between these models, indicating that the proteostatic stress observed in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and P23H rods likely originates from different pathobiological mechanisms, in which UPS substrate degradation may or may not be limited by P97-dependent substrate processing. Further, we assessed whether P97 overexpression could ameliorate pathology in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, in which proteostatic stress appears to result from P97 insufficiency. However, despite P97 overexpression being aphenotypic in other tissues, the ~2.4-fold increase in retinal P97 content was toxic to rods, which complicated the interpretation of the observed phenotype. Our results highlight the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms related to degrading misfolded proteins in mutant photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Many mutations linked to inherited retinal degenerations cause the production of misfolded photoreceptor proteins, which overwhelms the capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in affected photoreceptors and causes proteostatic stress. This stress has been shown to be a major factor contributing to photoreceptor cell death in multiple mouse models of retinal degeneration. Here, we show that proteostatic stress in two common retinal degeneration models results from insufficient capacities of distinct components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These results highlight the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms related to degrading misfolded proteins in mutant photoreceptors, which must be accounted for in the development of effective strategies to ameliorate these blinding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Multi-scale Imaging Reveals Aberrant Functional Connectome Organization and Elevated Dorsal Striatal Arc Expression in Advanced Age</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The functional connectome reflects a network architecture enabling adaptive behavior that becomes vulnerable in advanced age. The cellular mechanisms that contribute to altered functional connectivity in old age, however, are not known. Here we used a multi-scale imaging approach to link age-related changes in the functional connectome to altered expression of the activity-dependent immediate-early gene &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; as a function of training to multi-task on a working memory/bi-conditional association task (WM/BAT). Resting state fMRI data were collected from young and aged rats longitudinally at three different timepoints during cognitive training. After imaging, rats performed the WM/BAT and were immediately sacrificed to examine expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; during task performance. Aged behaviorally-impaired, but not young, rats had a subnetwork of increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal striatum (DS) that was correlated with the use of a suboptimal response-based strategy during cognitive testing. Moreover, while young rats had stable rich club organization across three scanning sessions, the rich club organization of old rats increased with cognitive training. In a control group of young and aged rats that were longitudinally scanned at similar time intervals, but without cognitive training, ACC-DS connectivity and rich club organization did not change between scans in either age group. These findings suggest that aberrant large-scale functional connectivity in aged animals is associated with altered cellular activity patterns within individual brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive decline is frequently observed in advanced age. Although impairments in older adults have been linked to alterations in resting state brain connectivity, how these changes relate to the neurobiology of individual neurons is unknown. The current study reports longitudinal changes in the functional connectome of aged rats with cognitive training that were not observed in young animals with better task performance. These network alterations in old age were associated with poorer task performance and increased &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; expression in the dorsal striatum. This work is significant because it links functional organization of brain networks to behavioral impairments and changes within individual neurons, providing a potential bridge between invasive cell-based analyses in animal models to imaging data from human study participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have potential as assistive
technologies for individuals with severe motor impairments. Nevertheless,
individuals must first participate in many training sessions to obtain adequate
data for optimizing the classification algorithm and subsequently acquiring
brain-based control. Such traditional training paradigms have been dubbed
unengaging and unmotivating for users. In recent years, it has been shown that
the synergy of virtual reality (VR) and a BCI can lead to increased user
engagement. This study created a 3-class BCI with a rather elaborate EEG signal
processing pipeline that heavily utilizes machine learning. The BCI initially
presented sham feedback but was eventually driven by EEG associated with motor
imagery. The BCI tasks consisted of motor imagery of the feet and left and
right hands, which were used to navigate a single-path maze in VR. Ten of the
eleven recruited participants achieved online performance superior to chance (p
&amp;lt; 0.01), while the majority successfully completed more than 70% of the
prescribed navigational tasks. These results indicate that the proposed
paradigm warrants further consideration as neurofeedback BCI training tool. A
paradigm that allows users, from their perspective, control from the outset
without the need for prior data collection sessions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper studied the change of vigilance based on stimulus coming
consecutively using the computerized version of the Mackworth Clock Test run
from PsyToolkit website. 7 participants (16.57 +/-1 years old, 2 males),
performed 10 consecutive trials in order to measure whether or not it is a
realistic goal for high school students to display the level of vigilance
expected from them in class. Success percentages were calculated by dividing
the number of correct jumps to the total number of jumps. The results indicated
that while the average success percentage for all subjects remained relatively
stable over the 10 trials (79% +/-7%), success percentages drop relatively as
the number of jumps increase. Success rate dropped from 90% (2 jumps) to 70% (7
jumps). We conclude that there is an upper limit of vigilance that should be
expected from students when they are exposed to more than 4 randomly occurring
attention requiring task within a minute.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many studies of neural activity in behaving animals aim to discover
interpretable low-dimensional structure in large-scale neural population
recordings. One approach to this problem is demixed principal component
analysis (dPCA), a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique to find
components that depend on particular experimental parameters. Here, I introduce
kernel dPCA (kdPCA) as a nonlinear extension of dPCA by applying kernel
least-squares regression to the demixing problem. I consider simulated examples
of neural populations with low-dimensional activity to compare the components
recovered from dPCA and kdPCA. These simulations demonstrate that neurally
relevant nonlinearities, such as stimulus-dependent gain and rotation,
interfere with linear demixing of neural activity into components that
represent to individual experimental parameters. However, kdPCA can still
recover interpretable components in these examples. Finally, I demonstrate
kdPCA using two examples of neural populations recorded during perceptual
decision-making tasks.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain 5-HT Deficiency Prevents Antidepressant-Like Effects of High-Fat-Diet and Blocks High-Fat-Diet-Induced GSK3β Phosphorylation in the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obesity is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders, but the nature of the relationship(s) between obesity and mental illness remains highly controversial. Some argue that depression and anxiety lead to increased consumption of “comfort foods,” the intake of which reduces negative affect and promotes obesity. In contrast, others have theorized that negative affect results from chronic excessive consumption of highly palatable foods. The brain serotonin (5-HT) system has long been implicated in both the development and treatment of mental illness. Preclinical studies have shown that low brain 5-HT exacerbates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by stress and blocks reductions in depression-like behavior induced by antidepressants, but the effects of brain 5-HT deficiency on responses to high-fat diet (HFD) have not been explored. The current work used genetically modified mice to evaluate the effects of low 5-HT on behavioral and molecular alterations induced by chronic exposure to HFD. Our results reveal that HFD decreases depression-like behavior and increases some anxiety-like behaviors in wild-type (WT) mice. However, genetic brain 5-HT deficiency blocks HFD-induced reductions in forced swim immobility and prevents HFD-induced increases in hippocampal GSK3β phosphorylation despite having no significant effects on HFD-induced changes in body weight or anxiety-like behavior. Together, our results suggest that brain 5-HT deficiency significantly impacts a subset of behavioral and molecular responses to HFD, a finding that could help explain the complex relationships between obesity and mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging because of genetic heterogeneity and overlapping manifestations. Targeted-gene panels (TGPs), coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), can facilitate the profiling of a large repertoire of ND-related genes. Due to the technical limitations inherent in NGS and TGPs, short tandem repeat (STR) variations are often ignored. However, STR expansions are known to cause such NDs as Huntington’s disease and spinocerebellar ataxias type 3 (SCA3). Here, we studied the clinical utility of a custom-made TGP that targets 199 NDs and 311 ND-associated genes on 118 undiagnosed patients. At least one known or likely pathogenic variation was found in 54 patients; 27 patients demonstrated clinical profiles that matched the variants; and 16 patients whose original diagnosis were refined. A high concordance of variant calling were observed when comparing the results from TGP and whole-exome sequencing of four patients. Our in-house STR detection algorithm has reached a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.82 in our SCA3 cohort. This study also uncovered a trove of novel and recurrent variants that may enrich the repertoire of ND-related genetic markers. We propose that a combined comprehensive TGPs-bioinformatics pipeline can improve the clinical diagnosis of NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular growth, function, and protection require proper iron management, and ferritin plays a crucial role as the major iron sequestration and storage protein. Ferritin is a 24 subunit spherical shell protein composed of both light (FTL) and heavy chain (FTH1) subunits, possessing complimentary iron-handling functions and forming three-fold and four-fold pores. Iron uptake through the three-fold pores is well-defined, but the unloading process somewhat less and generally focuses on lysosomal ferritin degradation although it may have an additional, energetically efficient pore mechanism. Hereditary Ferritinopathy (HF) or neuroferritinopathy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the FTL C-terminal sequence, which in turn cause disorder and unraveling at the four-fold pores allowing iron leakage and enhanced formation of toxic, improperly coordinated iron (ICI). Histopathologically, HF is characterized by iron deposition and formation of ferritin inclusion bodies (IBs) as the cells overexpress ferritin in an attempt to address iron accumulation while lacking the ability to clear ferritin and its aggregates. Overexpression and IB formation tax cells materially and energetically, i.e., their synthesis and disposal systems, and may hinder cellular transport and other spatially dependent functions. ICI causes cellular damage to proteins and lipids through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation because of high levels of brain oxygen, reductants and metabolism, taxing cellular repair. Iron can cause protein aggregation both indirectly by ROS-induced protein modification and destabilization, and directly as with mutant ferritin through C-terminal bridging. Iron release and ferritin degradation are also linked to cellular misfunction through ferritinophagy, which can release sufficient iron to initiate the unique programmed cell death process ferroptosis causing ROS formation and lipid peroxidation. But IB buildup suggests suppressed ferritinophagy, with elevated iron from four-fold pore leakage together with ROS damage and stress leading to a long-term ferroptotic-like state in HF. Several of these processes have parallels in cell line and mouse models. This review addresses the roles of ferritin structure and function within the above-mentioned framework, as they relate to HF and associated disorders characterized by abnormal iron accumulation, protein aggregation, oxidative damage, and the resulting contributions to cumulative cellular stress and death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Identification of Visual Attentional Regions of the Temporoparietal Junction in Individual Subjects using a Vivid, Novel Oddball Paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) of the cerebral cortex is a functionally heterogeneous region that also exhibits substantial anatomical variability across individuals. As a result, the precise functional organization of TPJ remains controversial. One or more regions within TPJ support visual attention processes, but the “attention TPJ” is difficult to functionally observe in individual subjects, and thus is typically identified by averaging across a large group of subjects. However, group-averaging also blurs localization and can obscure functional organization. Here, we develop and test an individual-subject approach to identifying attentional TPJ. This paradigm employs novel oddball images with a strong visual drive to produce robust TPJ responses in individuals. Vivid, novel oddballs drive responses in two TPJ regions bilaterally, a posterior region centered in posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (TPJ&lt;sub&gt;STS&lt;/sub&gt;) and an anterior region in ventral Supramarginal Gyrus (TPJ&lt;sub&gt;SMG&lt;/sub&gt;). Although an attentional reorienting task fails to drive TPJ activation in individuals, group analysis of the attentional reorienting contrast reveals recruitment of right TPJ&lt;sub&gt;STS&lt;/sub&gt;, but not right TPJ&lt;sub&gt;SMG&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, right TPJ&lt;sub&gt;STS&lt;/sub&gt;, as identified in individual subjects by the vivid, novel oddball contrast, is activated by attentional reorienting, but right TPJ&lt;sub&gt;SMG&lt;/sub&gt; is not. These findings advance an individual-subject based approach to understanding the functional organization of TPJ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Data augmentation is a popular technique which helps improve generalization capabilities of deep neural networks, and can be perceived as implicit regularization. It plays a pivotal role in scenarios in which the amount of high-quality ground-truth data is limited, and acquiring new examples is costly and time-consuming. This is a very common problem in medical image analysis, especially tumor delineation. In this paper, we review the current advances in data-augmentation techniques applied to magnetic resonance images of brain tumors. To better understand the practical aspects of such algorithms, we investigate the papers submitted to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS 2018 edition), as the BraTS dataset became a standard benchmark for validating existent and emerging brain-tumor detection and segmentation techniques. We verify which data augmentation approaches were exploited and what was their impact on the abilities of underlying supervised learners. Finally, we highlight the most promising research directions to follow in order to synthesize high-quality artificial brain-tumor examples which can boost the generalization abilities of deep models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: High-Mobility Group Box 1 Contributes to Cerebral Cortex Injury in a Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Rat Model by Regulating the Phenotypic Polarization of Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy is a severe disease for which there is currently no curative treatment. Recent evidence suggests that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein can promote neuroinflammation after stroke in adult rodents, but its role in perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) remains largely uninvestigated. In the present work, the potential role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of HIBD was explored. A HIBD model was established in postpartum day 7 rat pups. HMGB1 expression, the cellular distribution of HMGB1, and microglial activation were all evaluated. Glycyrrhizin (GL), an inhibitor of HMGB1, was used to investigate whether the inhibition of HMGB1 modulated microglial M1/M2 polarization or attenuated brain damage after HI. HAPI microglial cells and primary neurons were cultured in vitro and an oxygen-glucose deprivation model was established to evaluate the effects of different microglial-conditioned media on neurons using GL and recombinant HMGB1. Results showed that the expression of HMGB1 was increased in both the ipsilateral cortex and peripheral blood 72 h after HI. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that HMGB1 in the cortex was primarily expressed in neurons. This increase in cortical HMGB1 expression 72 h after HI was characterized by increased co-expression with microglia, rather than neurons or astrocytes. The expression of both M1 and M2 microglia was upregulated 72 h after HI. The administration of GL significantly suppressed M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglial polarization. Meanwhile, GL pretreatment significantly alleviated brain edema and cerebral infarction. In vitro experimentation showed that HMGB1-induced M1-conditioned media aggravated neuronal damage, but this effect was neutralized by GL. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may result in an imbalance of M1/M2 microglial polarization in the cortex and thus cause neuronal injury. Pharmacological blockade of HMGB1 signaling may attenuate this imbalanced polarization of microglia and thus could be used as a therapeutic strategy against brain injury in HIBD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Is Neuroprotective in Aged Rats With Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00349</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post-stroke systemic injections of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) exert neuroprotective effects in rats. In the current study, we aimed to test the efficacy of IGF-1 neuroprotection in aged rats (24–25 months old) and to compare the results with adult rats (6–7 months old). Furthermore, we addressed putative differences in microglial responses to IGF-1 in adult and aged rats. Rats were subjected to ischemic stroke while they were conscious by infusing endothelin-1 (Et-1) through a guide cannula that was implemented in the vicinity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Rats were given subcutaneous injections of IGF-1 (1 mg/kg) at 30 min and 120 min after the insult. Post-stroke IGF-1 treatment reduced the infarct size by 34% and 38% in aged and adult rats, respectively. The IGF-1 treated adult rats also showed significant improvement in sensorimotor function following stroke, while this function was not significantly affected in aged rats. Furthermore, aged rats displayed exaggerated activation of microglia in the ischemic hemisphere. Significant reduction of microglial activation by IGF-1 was only detected at specific regions in the ipsilateral hemisphere of adult rats. We show that IGF-1 reduced infarct size in aged rats with an ischemic stroke. It remains to be established, however, whether the age-related changes in microglial function affect the improvement in behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Genetic Background Influences the Propagation of Tau Pathology in Transgenic Rodent Models of Tauopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00343</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common tauopathy, is an age-dependent, progressive neurodegenerative disease. Epidemiological studies implicate the role of genetic background in the onset and progression of AD. Despite mutations in familial AD, several risk factors have been implicated in sporadic AD, of which the onset is unknown. In AD, there is a sequential and hierarchical spread of tau pathology to other brain areas. Studies have strived to understand the factors that influence this characteristic spread. Using transgenic rat models with different genetic backgrounds, we reported that the genetic background may influence the manifestation of neurofibrillary pathology. In this study we investigated whether genetic background has an influence in the spread of tau pathology, using hippocampal inoculations of insoluble tau from AD brains in rodent models of tauopathy with either a spontaneously hypertensive (SHR72) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY72) genetic background. We observed that insoluble tau from human AD induced AT8-positive neurofibrillary structures in the hippocampus of both lines. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of neurofibrillary structures, but the extent of spread was prominent in the W72 line. On the other hand, we observed significantly higher levels of AT8-positive structures in the parietal and frontal cortical areas in W72 when compared to SHR72. Interestingly, we also observed that the microglia in these brain areas in W72 were predominantly phagocytic in morphology (62.4% in parietal and 47.3% in frontal), while in SHR72 the microglia were either reactive or ramified (67.2% in parietal and 84.7% in frontal). The microglia in the hippocampus and occipital cortex in both lines were reactive or ramified structures. Factors such as gender or age are not responsible for the differences observed in these animals. Put together, our results, for the first time, show that the immune response modulating genetic variability is one of the factors that influences the propagation of tau neurofibrillary pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Globular Glial Tauopathy Type I Presenting as Atypical Progressive Aphasia, With Comorbid Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Globular glial tauopathies (GGTs) have heterogeneous presentations with little available information regarding typical clinical manifestations. We report on a case of atypical primary progressive aphasia (PPA) due to comorbid GGT and limbic transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy. The initial clinical phenotype was compatible with the nonfluent-agrammatical variant of PPA and early hippocampal amnesia. Progressively, parkinsonism and supranuclear oculomotor impairment occurred, and finally, late mutism with frontal-type dementia, impaired comprehension, and behavioral manifestations developed. The neuropathology was characteristic of GGT type I with vascular changes and comorbid limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Our findings expand the clinical spectrum of GGTs to include a complex progressive aphasia syndrome. The extraordinary feature, in this case, was the combination of two progressive aphasia subtypes, that is, the early nonfluent-agrammatical variant and the late semantic variant. Our findings also expand the spectrum of neuropathological comorbidities in GGT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Local translation can support memory consolidation by supplying new proteins to synapses undergoing plasticity. Translation in adult forebrain dendrites is an established mechanism of synaptic plasticity and is regulated by learning, yet there is no evidence for learning-regulated protein synthesis in adult forebrain axons, which have traditionally been believed to be incapable of translation. Here we show that axons in the adult rat amygdala contain translation machinery, and use translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) with RNASeq to identify mRNAs in cortical axons projecting to the amygdala, over 1200 of which were regulated during consolidation of associative memory. Mitochondrial and translation-related genes were upregulated, whereas synaptic, cytoskeletal, and myelin-related genes were downregulated; the opposite effects were observed in the cortex. Our results demonstrate that axonal translation occurs in the adult forebrain and is altered after learning, supporting the likelihood that local translation is more a rule than an exception in neuronal processes.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Agonist-specific voltage-dependent gating of lysosomal two-pore Na+ channels</title>

	<description>Mammalian two-pore-channels (TPC1, 2; &lt;i&gt;TPCN1, TPCN2&lt;/i&gt;) are ubiquitously- expressed, PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-activated, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective channels in the endosomes and lysosomes that regulate luminal pH homeostasis, membrane trafficking, and &lt;i&gt;Ebola&lt;/i&gt; viral infection. Whereas the channel activity of TPC1 is strongly dependent on membrane voltage, TPC2 lacks such voltage dependence despite the presence of the presumed ‘S4 voltage-sensing’ domains. By performing high-throughput screening followed by lysosomal electrophysiology, here we identified a class of tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs) as small-molecule agonists of TPC channels. TCAs activate both TPC1 and TPC2 in a voltage-dependent manner, referred to as &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Ly&lt;/span&gt;sosomal &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Na&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;oltage-dependent &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ctivators (LyNa-VAs). We also identified another compound which, like PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, activates TPC2 independent of voltage, suggesting the existence of agonist-specific gating mechanisms. Our identification of small-molecule TPC agonists should facilitate the studies of the cell biological roles of TPCs and can also readily explain the reported effects of TCAs in the modulation of autophagy and lysosomal functions.</description>

	<description>Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF-1) is a key regulator of the heat shock response (HSR). Upon heat shock, HSF-1 binds well-conserved motifs, called Heat Shock Elements (HSEs), and drives expression of genes important for cellular protection during this stress. Remarkably, we found that substantial numbers of HSEs in multiple &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; species reside within Helitrons, a type of DNA transposon. Consistent with Helitron-embedded HSEs being functional, upon heat shock they display increased HSF-1 and RNA polymerase II occupancy and up-regulation of nearby genes in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, we found that different genes appear to be incorporated into the HSR by species-specific Helitron insertions in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. briggsae&lt;/i&gt; and by strain-specific insertions among different wild isolates of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Our studies uncover previously unidentified targets of HSF-1 and show that Helitron insertions are responsible for rewiring and diversifying the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; HSR.</description>

	<description>In flies, the direction of moving ON and OFF features is computed separately. T4 (ON) and T5 (OFF) are the first neurons in their respective pathways to extract a directionally selective response from their non-selective inputs. Our recent study of T4 found that the integration of offset depolarizing and hyperpolarizing inputs is critical for the generation of directional selectivity. However, T5s lack small-field inhibitory inputs, suggesting they may use a different mechanism. Here we used whole-cell recordings of T5 neurons and found a similar receptive field structure: fast depolarization and persistent, spatially offset hyperpolarization. By assaying pairwise interactions of local stimulation across the receptive field, we found no amplifying responses, only suppressive responses to the non-preferred motion direction. We then evaluated passive, biophysical models and found that a model using direct inhibition, but not the removal of excitation, can accurately predict T5 responses to a range of moving stimuli.</description>

	<description>After complete spinal cord injury, mammals, including mice, rats and cats, recover hindlimb locomotion with treadmill training. The premise is that sensory cues consistent with locomotion reorganize spinal sensorimotor circuits. Here, we show that hindlimb standing and locomotion recover after spinal transection in cats without task-specific training. Spinal-transected cats recovered full weight bearing standing and locomotion after five weeks of rhythmic manual stimulation of triceps surae muscles (non-specific training) and without any intervention. Moreover, cats modulated locomotor speed and performed split-belt locomotion six weeks after spinal transection, functions that were not trained or tested in the weeks prior. This indicates that spinal networks controlling standing and locomotion and their interactions with sensory feedback from the limbs remain largely intact after complete spinal cord injury. We conclude that standing and locomotor recovery is due to the return of neuronal excitability within spinal sensorimotor circuits that do not require task-specific activity-dependent plasticity.</description>

	<description>Open Science has changed research by making data accessible and shareable, contributing to replicability to accelerate and disseminate knowledge. However, for rodent cognitive studies the availability of tools to share and disseminate data is scarce. Automated touchscreen-based tests enable systematic cognitive assessment with easily standardized outputs that can facilitate data dissemination. Here we present an integration of touchscreen cognitive testing with an open-access database public repository (mousebytes.ca), as well as a Web platform for knowledge dissemination (https://touchscreencognition.org). We complement these resources with the largest dataset of age-dependent high-level cognitive assessment of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, expanding knowledge of affected cognitive domains from male and female mice of three mouse strains. We envision that these new platforms will enhance sharing of protocols, data availability and transparency, allowing meta-analysis and reuse of mouse cognitive data to increase the replicability/reproducibility of datasets.</description>

	<description>Rod photoreceptors of nocturnal mammals display a striking inversion of nuclear architecture, which has been proposed as an evolutionary adaptation to dark environments. However, the nature of visual benefits and the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. It is widely assumed that improvements in nocturnal vision would depend on maximization of photon capture at the expense of image detail. Here we show that retinal optical quality improves 2-fold during terminal development, and that this enhancement is caused by nuclear inversion. We further demonstrate that improved retinal contrast transmission, rather than photon-budget or resolution, enhances scotopic contrast sensitivity by 18-27%, and improves motion detection capabilities up to 10-fold in dim environments. Our findings therefore add functional significance to a prominent exception of nuclear organization and establish retinal contrast transmission as a decisive determinant of mammalian visual perception.</description>

	<description>The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is a critical brain structure related to defensive behavior. However, still unclear is whether the rACC also plays a role in defensive behavior induced by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG). In the present study, rats were implanted with electrodes into the dPAG to determine freezing and escape response thresholds after sham or bilateral electrolytic lesions of the rACC. The duration of freezing behavior that outlasted electrical stimulation of the dPAG was also measured. The next day, these animals were subjected to contextual fear conditioning using footshock as an unconditioned stimulus. Lesions of the rACC did not change aversive freezing and escape response thresholds but disrupted post-dPAG stimulation freezing. The lesions also disrupted defensive freezing behavior and analgesia in the formalin test in response to contextual cues previously associated with footshock. These results indicate that the rACC is involved in some but not all aspects of defensive behavior generated at the level of the dPAG. The rACC also appears to play an important role in contextual fear conditioning.</description>

	<description>Central to our subjective lives is the experience of different emotions. Recent behavioral work mapping emotional responses to 2185 videos found that people experience upwards of 27 distinct emotions, which occupy a high-dimensional space, and that emotional categories, more so than affective dimensions, organize reports of subjective experience. Here, we sought to identify the neural substrates of this high-dimensional space of emotional experience using fMRI responses to the videos from this previous study. Our statistical analyses demonstrated that (1) dozens of video-evoked emotions were accurately predicted from fMRI patterns in multiple brain regions, (2) voxel-wise encoding models trained using categories better predicted voxel-wise responses than dimensions with unique superiority over visual and semantic covariates in transmodal regions, and (3) emotion-related fMRI responses had a cluster-like organization efficiently characterized by distinct categories. These results support an emerging theory of the high-dimensional emotion space, illuminating its neural foundations distributed across transmodal regions.</description>

	<description>Error-monitoring processes may be affected by transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology symptoms including trait anxiety, worry, and severity of depressive symptoms. We tested the relationship between continuous measures of anxiety and depressive symptomology and neural correlates of error-monitoring as measured by time-frequency domain delta and theta oscillatory power and time domain error-related negativity (ERN) amplitude extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Secondary analyses tested for diagnostic group differences in error-related neural responses in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and comorbid psychiatric disorders. 178 participants (104 female, M[SD]age = 21.7[4.6]) with a wide range of psychopathology symptoms completed a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task and symptom questionnaires. Residualized difference values between correct and error trials for delta/theta power and error/correct ERN amplitude were dependent variables. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex showed nonsignificant associations of symptom dimension measures with error-related residualized delta/theta power or residualized ERN amplitude. Subset analyses on those with confirmed psychopathology diagnoses also did not predict residualized error-related delta/theta power nor ERN amplitude. Exploratory analyses with only error trial delta/theta power and ERN amplitude also revealed nonsignificant relationships. Taken in the context of previous literature, results suggest a heterogeneous relationship between depressive and anxiety symptom dimensions and neurophysiological indices of error-monitoring.</description>

	<description>Rapid progress in technologies such as calcium imaging and electrophysiology has seen a dramatic increase in the size and extent of neural recordings, yet their interpretation still depends on time-intensive manual operations. Decoding provides a means to infer the information content of such recordings but typically requires highly processed data and prior knowledge of variables. Here, we developed DeepInsight - a deep-learning-framework able to decode sensory and behavioural variables directly from wide-band neural data. The network requires little user input and generalizes across stimuli, behaviours, brain regions, and recording techniques. Critically, once trained, it can be analysed to determine elements of the neural code that are informative about a given variable. We validated this approach using data from rodent auditory cortex and hippocampus, identifying a novel representation of head direction encoded by CA1 interneurons. Thus, we present a robust, user-friendly tool for characterising and decoding neural recordings in an automated way. Code is available at https://github.com/CYHSM/DeepInsight.</description>

	<description>Adolescence is a developmental period in which social interactions become increasingly important. Successful social interactions rely heavily on pragmatic competence, the appropriate use of language in different social contexts, a skill that is still developing in adolescence. In the present study, we used fMRI to characterize the brain networks underlying pragmatic language processing in typically developing adolescents. We used an indirect speech paradigm whereby participants were presented with question/answer dialogues in which the meaning of the answer had to be inferred from the context, in this case the preceding question. Participants were presented with three types of answers: (1) direct replies, i.e., simple answers to open-ended questions, (2) indirect informative replies, i.e., answers in which the speaker's intention was to add more information to a yes/no question, and (3) indirect affective replies, i.e., answers in which the speaker's intention was to express polite refusals, negative opinions or to save face in response to an emotionally charged question. We found that indirect affective replies elicited the strongest response in brain areas associated with language comprehension (superior temporal gyri), perspective-taking (medial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, and precuneus), and attention/working memory (inferior frontal gyri). The increased activation to indirect affective as opposed to indirect informative and direct replies potentially reflects the high salience of opinions and perspectives of others in adolescence. Our results add to previous findings on socio-cognitive processing in adolescents and extend them to pragmatic language comprehension.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the role of Nav1.7 sodium channels in chronic pain: an experimental and computational study</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/871236v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Chronic pain is a global healthcare problem with a huge societal impact. Its management remains generally unsatisfactory, with no single treatment clinically approved in most cases. In this study we use an in vitro model of erythromelalgia consisting of dorsal root ganglion neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from a patient (carrying the mutation F1449V) and a control subject. We combine neurophysiology and computational modelling to focus on the Nav1.7 voltage gated sodium channel, which acts as an amplifier of the receptor potential in nociceptive neurons and plays a critical role in erythromelalgia due to gain of function mutations causing the channel to open with smaller depolarisations. Using extracellular recordings, we found that the scorpion toxin OD1 (a Nav1.7 channel opener) increases dorsal root ganglion cell excitability in cultures obtained from the control donor, evidenced by an increase in spontaneous discharges, firing rate and spike amplitude. In addition, we confirmed previous reports of voltage clamp experiments concerning an increase in spontaneous discharge in the patient cell cultures and the analgesic effects of the Nav1.7 blocker PF-05089771. Our findings are explained with a conductance-based model of the dorsal root ganglion neuron, exploring its behaviour for different values of half activation voltage and inactivation removal rate of the Nav1.7 current. Erythromelalgia was simulated through a decrease of the Nav1.7 half activation voltage, turning previously subthreshold stimuli to pain-inducing, and successfully counteracted with the channel blocker. The painful effects of OD1 were simulated through a quicker removal of Nav1.7 inactivation that reproduced the effects of the toxin not only on the spike frequency but also on its amplitude.</description>

	<description>A family history (FH) of dementia, APOE4 genotype, and obesity are major risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease but their combined effects on the brain and cognition remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that these risk factors affect apparent white matter (WM) myelin and cognition including spatial navigation and processing speed in 166 asymptomatic individuals (38-71 years). Microstructure in temporal [fornix, parahippocampal cingulum, uncinate fasciculus], motor and whole-brain WM was assessed with myelin-sensitive indices from quantitative magnetization transfer [macromolecular proton fraction (MPF)] and axon density from diffusion imaging. Individuals with the highest genetic risk (FH+ and APOE4) compared to those with FH+ alone showed obesity-related reductions in MPF and axon density in the right parahippocampal cingulum. No effects were present for those without FH. Furthermore, FH modulated obesity-related effects on spatial navigation behaviour. In summary, an individual's genetic dementia risk influenced the impact of obesity on WM myelin and cognition.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Pallidonigroluysian Degeneration: A Clinicopathological Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25652?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25652?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pallidonigroluysian (PNL) system, the primary component of corticosubcortical circuits, is generally spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated the clinicopathological features of an unusual form of ALS with PNL degeneration (PNLD) and assessed whether ALS with PNLD represents a distinct ALS subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a cohort of 97 autopsied cases of sporadic ALS with phosphorylated 43kDa TAR DNA‐binding protein (TDP‐43) inclusions, we selected those with PNLD and analyzed their clinicopathological features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven cases (11%) that showed PNLD were divided into 2 subtypes depending on the lesion distribution: (1) extensive type (n = 6), showing widespread TDP‐43 pathology and multisystem degeneration, both involving the PNL system; and (2) limited type (n = 5), showing selective PNL and motor system involvement, thus being unclassifiable in terms of Brettschneiderʼs staging or Nishihiraʼs typing of ALS. The limited type showed a younger age at onset and predominant PNLD that accounted for the early development of extrapyramidal signs. The limited type exhibited the heaviest pathology in the subthalamus and external globus pallidus, suggesting that TDP‐43 inclusions propagated via indirect or hyperdirect pathways, unlike ALS without PNLD, where the direct pathway is considered to convey TDP‐43 aggregates from the cerebral cortex to the substantia nigra.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PNL system can be involved in the disease process of ALS, either nonselectively as part of multisystem degeneration, or selectively. ALS with selective involvement of the PNL and motor systems exhibits unique clinicopathological features and TDP‐43 propagation routes, thus representing a distinct subtype of ALS.

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Several recently developed Channelrhodopsin (ChR) variants are characterized by rapid kinetics and reduced desensitization in comparison to the widely used Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). However, little is known about how varying opsin properties may regulate their interaction with local network dynamics. We compared evoked cortical activity in mice expressing three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles under the CamKII promoter: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. We assessed overall neural activation by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using gamma-range (30-80Hz) LFP power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each tool. All variants caused light-evoked increases in firing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical gamma-band activity. Our findings suggest the properties of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, as well their engagement of circuit resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Genetically modified opsins are some of the most widely used experimental tools in modern neuroscience. However, although these tools are well characterized at the single-cell level, little is known about how the varying properties of the opsins affect their interactions with active neural networks &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we present data from experiments using three optogenetic tools with distinct activation/inactivation and kinetic profiles. We find that opsin properties regulate the amplitude and temporal pattern of activity evoked &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Despite all evoking elevated spiking, the three opsins also differentially regulate cortical gamma oscillations. These data suggest that the kinetic properties of optogenetic tools interact with active neural circuits on several time scales. Optogenetic tool selection should therefore be a key element of experimental design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We discovered a new type of dendritic spine. It is found on space-specific neurons in the barn owl inferior colliculus, a site of experience-dependent plasticity. Connectomic analysis revealed dendritic protrusions of unusual morphology including topological holes, hence termed ‘toric’ spines (n = 76). More significantly, presynaptic terminals converging onto individual toric spines displayed numerous active zones (up to 49) derived from multiple axons (up to 11) with incoming trajectories distributed widely throughout 3D space. This arrangement is suited to integrate input sources. Dense reconstruction of two toric spines revealed that they were unconnected with the majority (~84%) of intertwined axons, implying a high capacity for information storage. We developed an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice preparation and provide the first published data on space-specific neuron intrinsic properties, including cellular subtypes with and without toric-like spines. We propose that toric spines are a cellular locus of sensory integration and behavioral learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The majority of excitatory synapses in the brain are formed onto dendritic spines, which typically act to isolate the action of individual synapses. We discovered a new type of spine which in contrast receives convergent input from many different axons. These ‘toric’ spines, named for their topological holes, are found on space-specific neurons in the barn owl auditory system. We used a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology, super-resolution optical microscopy and serial block electron microscopy to characterize the ultrastructure and wiring of toric spines, and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; patch clamp recording to elucidate the cells’ electrical properties. These data lead us to propose that toric spines serve as microanatomical hubs for neuronal computation, plasticity and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Reward Devaluation Attenuates Cue-Evoked Sucrose Seeking and Is Associated with the Elimination of Excitability Differences between Ensemble and Non-ensemble Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals must learn relationships between foods and the environmental cues that predict their availability for survival. Such cue–food associations are encoded in sparse sets of neurons or &quot;neuronal ensembles&quot; in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). For these ensemble-encoded, cue-controlled appetitive responses to remain adaptive, they must allow for their dynamic updating depending on acute changes in internal states such as physiological hunger or the perceived desirability of food. However, how these neuronal ensembles are recruited and physiologically modified following the update of such learned associations is unclear. To investigate this, we examined the effects of devaluation on ensemble plasticity at the levels of recruitment, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic physiology in sucrose-conditioned &lt;i&gt;Fos-GFP&lt;/i&gt; mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in recently activated neurons. Neuronal ensemble activation patterns and their physiology were examined using immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology, respectively. Reward-specific devaluation following 4 d of &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; sucrose consumption, but not general caloric devaluation, attenuated cue-evoked sucrose seeking. This suggests that changes in the hedonic and/or incentive value of sucrose, and not caloric need, drove this behavior. Moreover, devaluation attenuated the size of the neuronal ensemble recruited by the cue in the NAc shell. Finally, it eliminated the relative enhanced excitability of ensemble (GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons against non-ensemble (GFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons observed under non-devalued conditions, and did not induce any ensemble-specific changes in excitatory synaptic physiology. Our findings provide new insights into neuronal ensemble mechanisms that underlie the changes in the incentive and/or hedonic impact of cues that support adaptive food seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals entrains to ambient light via the retinal photoreceptors. This allows behavioral rhythms to change in synchrony with seasonal and daily changes in light period. Circadian rhythmicity is progressively disrupted in Huntington’s disease (HD) and in HD mouse models such as the transgenic R6/2 line. Although retinal afferent inputs to the SCN are disrupted in R6/2 mice at late stages, they can respond to changes in light/dark cycles, as seen in jet lag and 23 h/d paradigms. To investigate photic entrainment and SCN function in R6/2 mice at different stages of disease, we first assessed the effect on locomotor activity of exposure to a 15 min light pulse given at different times of the day. We then placed the mice under five non-standard light conditions. These were light cycle regimes (T-cycles) of T21 (10.5 h light/dark), T22 (11 h light/dark), T26 (13 h light/dark), constant light, or constant dark. We found a progressive impairment in photic synchronization in R6/2 mice when the stimuli required the SCN to lengthen rhythms (phase-delaying light pulse, T26, or constant light), but normal synchronization to stimuli that required the SCN to shorten rhythms (phase-advancing light pulse and T22). Despite the behavioral abnormalities, we found that &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and c-&lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt; gene expression remained photo-inducible in SCN of R6/2 mice. Both the endogenous drift of the R6/2 mouse SCN to shorter periods and its inability to adapt to phase-delaying changes will contribute to the HD circadian dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The field of basal cognition seeks to understand how adaptive,
context-specific behavior occurs in non-neural biological systems.
Embryogenesis and regeneration require plasticity in many tissue types to
achieve structural and functional goals in diverse circumstances. Thus,
advances in both evolutionary cell biology and regenerative medicine require an
understanding of how non-neural tissues could process information. Neurons
evolved from ancient cell types that used bioelectric signaling to perform
computation. However, it has not been shown whether or how non-neural
bioelectric cell networks can support computation. We generalize connectionist
methods to non-neural tissue architectures, showing that a minimal non-neural
Bio-Electric Network (BEN) model that utilizes the general principles of
bioelectricity (electrodiffusion and gating) can compute. We characterize BEN
behaviors ranging from elementary logic gates to pattern detectors, using both
fixed and transient inputs to recapitulate various biological scenarios. We
characterize the mechanisms of such networks using dynamical-systems and
information-theory tools, demonstrating that logic can manifest in
bidirectional, continuous, and relatively slow bioelectrical systems,
complementing conventional neural-centric architectures. Our results reveal a
variety of non-neural decision-making processes as manifestations of general
cellular biophysical mechanisms and suggest novel bioengineering approaches to
construct functional tissues for regenerative medicine and synthetic biology as
well as new machine learning architectures.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have reported auditory and
visual dysfunction that persists beyond the acute incident. The etiology behind
these symptoms is difficult to characterize with current clinical imaging.
These functional deficits may be caused by shear injury or micro-bleeds, which
can be detected with special imaging modalities. We explore these hypotheses in
a pilot study of multi-parametric MRI. We extract over 1,000 imaging and
clinical metrics and project them to a low-dimensional space, where we can
discriminate between healthy controls and patients with mTBI. We also show
correlations between the metric representations and patient symptoms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04083</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The classical biophysical Morris-Lecar model of neuronal excitability
predicts that upon stimulation of the neuron with a sufficiently large constant
depolarizing current there exists a finite interval of the current values where
periodic spike generation occurs. Above the upper boundary of this interval
there is a four-stage damping of the spike amplitude: 1) minor primary damping,
which reflects a typical transient to stationary state, 2) plateau of nearly
undamped periodic oscillations, 3) strong damping, and 4) reaching a constant
stationary asymptotic value $V_{st}$ of the neuron potential. We have
linearized the Morris-Lecar model equations at the vicinity of $V_{st}$ and
have shown that the linearized equations can be reduced to a standard equation
for exponentially damped harmonic oscillations. Importantly, all coefficients
of this equation can be explicitly expressed through parameters of the original
Morris-Lecar model, enabling direct comparison (i.e. without any fitting) of
the numerical and analytical solutions for the neuron potential dynamics at
later stages of the spike amplitude damping. This allows to explore
quantitatively the applicability boundary of linear stability analysis that
implies exponential damping.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03934</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Based on a biophysical model of retinal Starburst Amacrine Cell (SAC)
\cite{karvouniari-gil-etal:19} we analyse here the dynamics of retinal waves,
arising during the visual system development. Waves are induced by spontaneous
bursting of SACs and their coupling via acetycholine. We show that, despite the
acetylcholine coupling intensity has been experimentally observed to change
during development \cite{zheng-lee-etal:04}, SACs retinal waves can
nevertheless stay in a regime with power law distributions, reminiscent of a
critical regime. Thus, this regime occurs on a range of coupling parameters
instead of a single point as in usual phase transitions. We explain this
phenomenon thanks to a coherence-resonance mechanism, where noise is
responsible for the broadening of the critical coupling strength range.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks are the basis of versatile and power-efficient
information processing in the brain. Although we currently lack a detailed
understanding of how these networks compute, recently developed optimization
techniques allow us to instantiate increasingly complex functional spiking
neural networks in-silico. These methods hold the promise to build more
efficient non-von-Neumann computing hardware and will offer new vistas in the
quest of unraveling brain circuit function. To accelerate the development of
such methods, objective ways to compare their performance are indispensable.
Presently, however, there are no widely accepted means for comparing the
computational performance of spiking neural networks. To address this issue, we
introduce a general audio-to-spiking conversion procedure and provide two novel
spike-based classification datasets. The datasets are free and require no
additional preprocessing, which renders them broadly applicable to benchmark
both software and neuromorphic hardware implementations of spiking neural
networks. By training a range of conventional and spiking classifiers, we show
that leveraging spike timing information within these datasets is essential for
good classification accuracy. These results serve as the first reference for
future performance comparisons of spiking neural networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To predict and maximize future rewards in this ever-changing world, animals
must be able to discover the temporal structure of stimuli and then anticipate
or act correctly at the right time. However, we still lack a systematic
understanding of the neural mechanisms of how animals perceive, maintain, and
use time intervals ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to multi-seconds in
working memory, the combination of time information with spatial information
processing and decision making, and the reasons for the strong neuronal
temporal signal even when animals performing tasks in which time information is
not required. Here, we addressed these problems by training neural network
models. We reveal that neural networks perceive time intervals through the
evolution of population state along stereotypical trajectory, maintain time
intervals by line attractor along which most neurons vary their activities
monotonically with the duration of the maintained interval, and produce or
compare time intervals by scaling the evolution velocity of population state.
Time and non-time information is coded in subspaces orthogonal with each other,
which facilitates generalizable decoding of time and non-time information. This
is based on the network structure of multiple feedforward sequences that
mutually excite or inhibit depending on whether their preferences of non-timing
information are similar or not. Strong temporal signal in non-timing tasks
arises from high temporal complexity of task, broad input tuning, multi-tasking
and timing anticipation. Our work discloses fundamental computional principles
of temporal processing, and is supported by and gives predictions to a number
of experimental phenomena.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: An Assessment of Melatonin’s Therapeutic Value in the Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy of the Newborn</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00034</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most frequent causes of brain injury in the newborn. From a pathophysiological standpoint, a complex process takes place at the cellular and tissue level during the development of newborn brain damage in the absence of oxygen. Initially, the lesion is triggered by a deficit in the supply of oxygen to cells and tissues, causing a primary energy insufficiency. Subsequently, high energy phosphate levels recover transiently (the latent phase) that is followed by a secondary phase, in which many of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of neonatal brain damage ensue (i.e., excitotoxicity, massive influx of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, oxidative and nitrosative stress, inflammation). This leads to cell death by necrosis or apoptosis. Eventually, a tertiary phase occurs, characterized by the persistence of brain damage for months and even years after the HI insult. Hypothermia is the only therapeutic strategy against HIE that has been incorporated into neonatal intensive care units with limited success. Thus, there is an urgent need for agents with the capacity to curtail acute and chronic damage in HIE. Melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, has a potential role as a neuroprotective agent both acutely and chronically in HIE. Melatonin displays a remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and is capable to cross the blood-brain barrier readily. Moreover, in many animal models of brain degeneration, melatonin was effective to impair chronic mechanisms of neuronal death. In animal models, and in a limited number of clinical studies, melatonin increased the level of protection developed by hypothermia in newborn asphyxia. This review article summarizes briefly the available therapeutic strategies in HIE and assesses the role of melatonin as a potentially relevant therapeutic tool to cover the hypoxia-ischemia phase and the secondary and tertiary phases following a hypoxic-ischemic insult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Analysis of Schwann Cell Migration and Axon Regeneration Following Nerve Injury in the Sciatic Nerve Bridge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While it is proposed that interaction between Schwann cells and axons is key for successful nerve regeneration, the behavior of Schwann cells migrating into a nerve gap following a transection injury and how migrating Schwann cells interact with regenerating axons within the nerve bridge has not been studied in detail. In this study, we combine the use of our whole-mount sciatic nerve staining with the use of a proteolipid protein-green fluorescent protein (PLP-GFP) mouse model to mark Schwann cells and have examined the behavior of migrating Schwann cells and regenerating axons in the sciatic nerve gap following a nerve transection injury. We show here that Schwann cell migration from both nerve stumps starts later than the regrowth of axons from the proximal nerve stump. The first migrating Schwann cells are only observed 4 days following mouse sciatic nerve transection injury. Schwann cells migrating from the proximal nerve stump overtake regenerating axons on day 5 and form Schwann cell cords within the nerve bridge by 7 days post-transection injury. Regenerating axons begin to attach to migrating Schwann cells on day 6 and then follow their trajectory navigating across the nerve gap. We also observe that Schwann cell cords in the nerve bridge are not wide enough to guide all the regenerating axons across the nerve bridge, resulting in regenerating axons growing along the outside of both proximal and distal nerve stumps. From this analysis, we demonstrate that Schwann cells play a crucial role in controlling the directionality and speed of axon regeneration across the nerve gap. We also demonstrate that the use of the PLP-GFP mouse model labeling Schwann cells together with the whole sciatic nerve axon staining technique is a useful research model to study the process of peripheral nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Targeting Reciprocally Connected Brain Regions Through CAV-2 Mediated Interventions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An important issue in contemporary neuroscience is to identify functional principles at play within neural circuits. The reciprocity of the connections between two distinct brain areas appears as an intriguing feature of some of these circuits. This organization has been viewed as “re-entry,” a process whereby two or more brain regions concurrently stimulate and are stimulated by each other, thus supporting the synchronization of neural firing required for rapid neural integration. However, until relatively recently, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive functional assessment of such reciprocal pathways. In this Brief Research Report, we highlight the use of a chemogenetic strategy to target projection-defined neurons in reciprocally connected areas through CAV-2 mediated interventions in the rat. Specifically, we targeted the bidirectional pathways between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the mediodorsal thalamus, as well as those connecting the insular cortex (IC) and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). These data showcase the usefulness of CAV-2-related strategies to address circuit-level issues. Moreover, we illustrate the inherent limitation of Cre-dependent adeno-associated virues (AAVs) with “leaked” expression of the gene of interest in the absence of Cre and highlight the need for appropriate control conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Analyzing Neuroimaging Data Through Recurrent Deep Learning Models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01321</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The application of deep learning (DL) models to neuroimaging data poses several challenges, due to the high dimensionality, low sample size, and complex temporo-spatial dependency structure of these data. Even further, DL models often act as black boxes, impeding insight into the association of cognitive state and brain activity. To approach these challenges, we introduce the DeepLight framework, which utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based DL models to analyze whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. To decode a cognitive state (e.g., seeing the image of a house), DeepLight separates an fMRI volume into a sequence of axial brain slices, which is then sequentially processed by an LSTM. To maintain interpretability, DeepLight adapts the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique. Thereby, decomposing its decoding decision into the contributions of the single input voxels to this decision. Importantly, the decomposition is performed on the level of single fMRI volumes, enabling DeepLight to study the associations between cognitive state and brain activity on several levels of data granularity, from the level of the group down to the level of single time points. To demonstrate the versatility of DeepLight, we apply it to a large fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that DeepLight outperforms conventional approaches of uni- and multivariate fMRI analysis in decoding the cognitive states and in identifying the physiologically appropriate brain regions associated with these states. We further demonstrate DeepLight's ability to study the fine-grained temporo-spatial variability of brain activity over sequences of single fMRI samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Systems Biology section | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Sudden Deprivation of Sensory Inputs From Periodontium on Mastication</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of sudden deprivation of sensory inputs from the periodontium on jaw kinematics and time-varying activation profile of the masseter muscle.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fourteen (age range: 22–26 years; four men) healthy and natural dentate volunteers participated in a single experimental session. During the experiment, the participants were asked to eat six hard visco-elastic test food models, three each before and after an anesthetic intervention. The movements of the jaw in three dimensions and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the masseter muscle on the chewing side were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results of the study showed no significant differences in the number of chewing cycles (P = 0.233) and the duration of chewing sequence (P = 0.198) due to sudden deprivation of sensory inputs from the periodontium. However, there was a significant increase in the jaw opening velocity (P = 0.030) and a significant increase in the duration of occlusal phase (P = 0.004) during the anesthetized condition. The EMG activity of the jaw closing phase was significantly higher during the control condition [116.5 arbitrary units (AU)] than anesthetized condition (93.9 AU). The temporal profile of the masseter muscle showed a biphasic increase in the excitatory muscle drive in the control condition but this increase was virtually absent during the anesthetized condition.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Sudden deprivation of sensory inputs from the periodontium affects the jaw kinematics and jaw muscle activity, with a clear difference in the time-varying activation profile of the masseter muscle. The activation profile of the masseter muscle shows that periodontal mechanoreceptors contribute to approximately 20% of the EMG activity during the jaw closing phase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Swimming in Deep Water: Zebrafish Modeling of Complicated Forms of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia and Spastic Ataxia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and hereditary ataxia (HA) are two groups of disorders characterized, respectively, by progressive dysfunction or degeneration of the pyramidal tracts (HSP) and of the Purkinje cells and spinocerebellar tracts (HA). Although HSP and HA are generally shown to have distinct clinical-genetic profiles, in several cases the clinical presentation, the causative genes, and the cellular pathways and mechanisms involved overlap between the two forms. Genetic analyses in humans in combination with in vitro and in vivo studies using model systems have greatly expanded our knowledge of spinocerebellar degenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a vertebrate model widely used in biomedical research since its overall nervous system organization is similar to that of humans. A critical analysis of the literature suggests that zebrafish could serve as a powerful experimental tool for molecular and genetic dissection of both HA and HSP. The zebrafish, found to be very useful for demonstrating the causal relationship between defect and mutation, also offers a useful platform to exploit for the development of therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Differential Circular RNA Expression Profiles Following Spinal Cord Injury in Rats: A Temporal and Experimental Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI), one of the most severe types of neurological damage, results in persistent motor and sensory dysfunction and involves complex gene alterations. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently discovered class of regulatory molecules, and their roles in SCI still need to be addressed. This study comprehensively investigated circRNA alterations in rats across a set time course (days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) after hemisection SCI at the right T9 site. A total of 360 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified using RNA sequencing. From these, the functions of the exonic circRNA_01477 were further explored in cultured spinal cord astrocytes. Knockdown of circRNA_01477 significantly inhibited astrocyte proliferation and migration. The circRNA_01477/microRNAs (miRNA)/messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction network was visualized following microarray assay. Among the downregulated differentially expressed mRNAs, four of the seven validated genes were controlled by miRNA-423-5p. We then demonstrated that miRNA-423-5p is significantly upregulated after circRNA_01477 depletion. In summary, this study provides, for the first time, a systematic evaluation of circRNA alterations following SCI and an insight into the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved. It further reveals that circRNA_01477/miR-423-5p could be a key regulator involved in regulating the changeable regeneration environment that occurs during recovery from SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Correspondence Between Cognitive and Audiological Evaluations Among the Elderly: A Preliminary Report of an Audiological Screening Model of Subjects at Risk of Cognitive Decline With Slight to Moderate Hearing Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01279</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01279</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies show increasing prevalence rates of cognitive decline and hearing loss with age, particularly after the age of 65 years. These conditions are reported to be associated, although conclusive evidence of causality and implications is lacking. Nevertheless, audiological and cognitive assessment among elderly people is a key target for comprehensive and multidisciplinary evaluation of the subject’s frailty status. To evaluate the use of tools for identifying older adults at risk of hearing loss and cognitive decline and to compare skills and abilities in terms of hearing and cognitive performances between older adults and young subjects, we performed a prospective cross-sectional study using supraliminal auditory tests. The relationship between cognitive assessment results and audiometric results was investigated, and reference ranges for different ages or stages of disease were determined. Patients older than 65 years with different degrees of hearing function were enrolled. Each subject underwent an extensive audiological assessment, including tonal and speech audiometry, Italian Matrix Sentence Test, and speech audiometry with logatomes in quiet. Cognitive function was screened and then verified by experienced clinicians using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and further investigations in some. One hundred twenty-three subjects were finally enrolled during 2016–2019: 103 were &amp;gt;65 years of age and 20 were younger participants (as controls). Cognitive functions showed a correlation with the audiological results in post-lingual hearing-impaired patients, in particular in those affected by slight to moderate hearing loss and aged more than 70 years. Audiological testing can thus be useful in clinical assessment and identification of patients at risk of cognitive impairment. The study was limited by its sample size (CI 95%; CL 10%), strict dependence on language, and hearing threshold. Further investigations should be conducted to confirm the reported results and to verify similar screening models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Spinal Cord Metabolic Signatures in Models of Fast- and Slow-Progressing SOD1G93A Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01276</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The rate of disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is highly variable, even between patients with the same genetic mutations. Metabolic alterations may affect disease course variability in ALS patients, but challenges in identifying the preclinical and early phases of the disease limit our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying differences in the rate of disease progression. We examined effects of SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; on thoracic and lumbar spinal cord metabolites in two mouse ALS models with different rates of disease progression: the transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;-C57BL/6JOlaHsd (C57-G93A, slow progression) and transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;-129SvHsd (129S-G93A, fast progression) strains. Samples from three timepoints (presymptomatic, disease onset, and late stage disease) were analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry metabolomics. Tissue metabolome differences in the lumbar spinal cord were driven primarily by mouse genetic background, although larger responses were observed in metabolic trajectories after the onset of symptoms. The significantly affected lumbar spinal cord metabolites were involved in energy and lipid metabolism. In the thoracic spinal cord, metabolic differences related to genetic background, background-SOD1 genotype interactions, and longitudinal SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; effects. The largest responses in thoracic spinal cord metabolic trajectories related to SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; effects before onset of visible symptoms. More metabolites were significantly affected in the thoracic segment, which were involved in energy homeostasis, neurotransmitter synthesis and utilization, and the oxidative stress response. We find evidence that initial metabolic alterations in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice confer disadvantages for maintaining neuronal viability under ALS-related stressors, with slow-progressing C57-G93A mice potentially having more favorable spinal cord bioenergetic profiles than 129S-G93A. These genetic background-associated metabolic differences together with the different early metabolic responses underscore the need to better characterize the impact of germline genetic variation on cellular responses to ALS gene mutations both before and after the onset of symptoms in order to understand their impact on disease development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Identifying Vulnerable Brain Networks in Mouse Models of Genetic Risk Factors for Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The major genetic risk for late onset Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with the presence of APOE4 alleles. However, the impact of different APOE alleles on the brain aging trajectory, and how they interact with the brain local environment in a sex specific manner is not entirely clear. We sought to identify vulnerable brain circuits in novel mouse models with homozygous targeted replacement of the mouse ApoE gene with either human APOE3 or APOE4 gene alleles. These genes are expressed in mice that also model the human immune response to age and disease-associated challenges by expressing the human NOS2 gene in place of the mouse mNos2 gene. These mice had impaired learning and memory when assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Ex vivo MRI-DTI analyses revealed global and local atrophy, and areas of reduced fractional anisotropy (FA). Using tensor network principal component analyses for structural connectomes, we inferred the pairwise connections which best separate APOE4 from APOE3 carriers. These involved primarily interhemispheric connections among regions of olfactory areas, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Our results also suggest that pairwise connections may be subdivided and clustered spatially to reveal local changes on a finer scale. These analyses revealed not just genotype, but also sex specific differences. Identifying vulnerable networks may provide targets for interventions, and a means to stratify patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Music Improvisation Is Characterized by Increase EEG Spectral Power in Prefrontal and Perceptual Motor Cortical Sources and Can be Reliably Classified From Non-improvisatory Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study expores neural activity underlying creative processes through the investigation of music improvisation. Fourteen guitar players with a high level of improvisation skill participated in this experiment. The experimental task involved playing 32-s alternating blocks of improvisation and scales on guitar. electroencephalography (EEG) data was measured continuously throughout the experiment. In order to remove potential artifacts and extract brain-related activity the following signal processing techniques were employed: bandpass filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). For each participant, artifact related independent components (ICs) were removed from the EEG data and only ICs found to be from brain activity were retained. Source localization using this brain-related activity was carried out using sLORETA. Greater activity for improvisation over scale was found in multiple frequency bands (theta, alpha, and beta) localized primarily in the medial frontal cortex (MFC), Middle frontal gyrus (MFG), anterior cingulate, polar medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), premotor cortex (PMC), pre and postcentral gyrus (PreCG and PostCG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the temporal-parietal junction. Together this collection of brain regions suggests that improvisation was mediated by processes involved in coordinating planned sequences of movement that are modulated in response to ongoing environmental context through monitoring and feedback of sensory states in relation to internal plans and goals. Machine-learning using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) for EEG feature extraction attained a mean of over 75% classification performance for improvisation vs. scale conditions across participants. These machine-learning results are a step towards the development of a brain-computer interface that could be used for neurofeedback training to improve creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the field of dynamic brain networks continues to expand, new methods are needed to allow for optimal handling and understanding of this explosion in data. We propose here a novel approach that embeds dynamic brain networks onto a two-dimensional (2D) manifold based on similarities and differences in network organization. Each brain network is represented as a single point on the low dimensional manifold with networks of similar topology being located in close proximity. The rich spatio-temporal information has great potential for visualization, analysis, and interpretation of dynamic brain networks. The fact that each network is represented by a single point makes it possible to switch between the low-dimensional space and the full connectivity of any given brain network. Thus, networks in a specific region of the low-dimensional space can be examined to identify network features, such as the location of brain network hubs or the interconnectivity between brain circuits. In this proof-of-concept manuscript, we show that these low dimensional manifolds contain meaningful information, as they were able to successfully discriminate between cognitive tasks and study populations. This work provides evidence that embedding dynamic brain networks onto low dimensional manifolds has the potential to help us better visualize and understand dynamic brain networks with the hope of gaining a deeper understanding of normal and abnormal brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Spike Train Distance Robust to Firing Rate Changes Based on the Earth Mover’s Distance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural spike train analysis methods are mainly used for understanding the temporal aspects of neural information processing. One approach is to measure the dissimilarity between the spike trains of a pair of neurons, often referred to as the spike train distance. The spike train distance has been often used to classify neuronal units with similar temporal patterns. Several methods to compute spike train distance have been developed so far. Intuitively, a desirable distance should be the shortest length between two objects. The Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) can compute spike train distance by measuring the shortest length between two spike trains via shifting a fraction of spikes from one spike train to another. The EMD could accurately measure spike timing differences, temporal similarity, and spikes time synchrony. It is also robust to firing rate changes. Victor and Purpura (1996) distance measures the minimum cost between two spike trains. Although it also measures the shortest path between spike trains, its output can vary with the time-scale parameter. In contrast, the EMD measures distance in a unique way by calculating the genuine shortest length between spike trains. The EMD also outperforms other existing spike train distance methods in measuring various aspects of the temporal characteristics of spike trains and in robustness to firing rate changes. The EMD can effectively measure the shortest length between spike trains without being considerably affected by the overall firing rate difference between them. Hence, it is suitable for pure temporal coding exclusively, which is a predominant premise underlying the present study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Head direction (HD) cells, which fire action potentials whenever an animal points its head in a particular direction, are thought to subserve the animal’s sense of spatial orientation. HD cells are found prominently in several thalamo-cortical regions including anterior thalamic nuclei, postsubiculum, medial entorhinal cortex, parasubiculum, and the parietal cortex. While a number of methods in neural decoding have been developed to assess the dynamics of spatial signals within thalamo-cortical regions, studies conducting a quantitative comparison of machine learning and statistical model-based decoding methods on HD cell activity are currently lacking. Here, we compare statistical model-based and machine learning approaches by assessing decoding accuracy and evaluate variables that contribute to population coding across thalamo-cortical HD cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss represents a major sensory impairment in humans with a strong impact on quality of life. The current standard of care for chronic sensorineural hearing loss is limited to hearing aids and implantable devices like cochlear implants. Treatments for acute hearing loss consist of systemic or intratympanic corticosteroids. Emerging therapies are being developed to prevent hearing loss or to restore it at the cellular level. Many challenges and questions remain as to the delivery of these therapeutics into the inner ear. Scientists, clinicians, and industry stakeholders should always consider the treatment burden from the patient’s perspective when designing new drug delivery approaches. This article highlights key issues to consider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Predicted Brain Age After Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00348</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a known non-modifiable risk factor for stroke. Usually, this refers to chronological rather than biological age. Biological brain age can be estimated based on cortical and subcortical brain measures. For stroke patients, it could serve as a more sensitive marker of brain health than chronological age. In this study, we investigated whether there is a difference in brain age between stroke survivors and control participants matched on chronological age. We estimated brain age at 3 months after stroke, and then followed the longitudinal trajectory over three time-points: within 6 weeks (baseline), at 3 and at 12 months following their clinical event. We found that brain age in stroke participants was higher compared to controls, with the mean difference between the groups varying between 3.9 and 8.7 years depending on the brain measure used for prediction. This difference in brain age was observed at 6 weeks after stroke and maintained at 3 and 12 months after stroke. The presence of group differences already at baseline suggests that stroke might be an ultimate manifestation of gradual cerebrovascular burden accumulation and brain degeneration. Brain age prediction, therefore, has the potential to be a useful biomarker for quantifying stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Nodal Global Efficiency in Front-Parietal Lobe Mediated Periventricular White Matter Hyperintensity (PWMH)-Related Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is widely observed in the elderly population and serves as a key indicator of cognitive impairment (CI). However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, we investigated the topological patterns of resting state functional networks in WMH subjects and the relationship between the topological measures and CI. A graph theory-based analysis was employed in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans of 112 subjects (38 WMH subjects with cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), 36 WMH subjects with normal cognition and 38 healthy controls (HCs), and we found that WMH-CIND subjects displayed decreased global efficiency at the levels of the whole brain, specific subnetworks [fronto-parietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON)] and certain nodes located in the FPN and CON, as well as decreased local efficiency in subnetworks. Our results demonstrated that nodal global efficiency in frontal and parietal regions mediated the impairment of information processing speed related to periventricular WMH (PWMH). Additionally, we performed support vector machine (SVM) analysis and found that altered functional efficiency can identify WMH-CIND subjects with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. These findings suggest impaired functional networks in WMH-CIND individuals and that decreased functional efficiency may be a feature of CI in WMH subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: White Matter Regions With Low Microstructure in Young Adults Spatially Coincide With White Matter Hyperintensities in Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microstructural and macrostructural white matter damage occurs frequently with aging, is associated with negative health outcomes, and can be imaged non-invasively as fractional anisotropy (FA) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), respectively. The extent to which diminished microstructure precedes or results from macrostructural white matter damage is poorly understood. This study evaluated the hypothesis that white matter areas with normatively lower microstructure in young adults are most susceptible to develop WMH in older adults. Forty-nine younger participants (age = 25.8 ± 2.8 years) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 557 older participants (age = 73.9 ± 5.7 years) underwent DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In older adults, WMH had a mostly periventricular distribution with higher frequency in frontal regions. We found lower FA in areas of frank WMH compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in older adults. Then, to determine if areas of normatively lower white matter microstructure spatially overlap with areas that frequently develop macrostructural damage in older age, we created a WMH frequency map in which each voxel represented the percentage of older adults with a WMH in that voxel. We found lower normative FA in young adults with regions frequently segmented as WMH in older adults. We conclude that low white matter microstructure is observed in areas of white matter macrostructural damage, but white matter microstructure is also normatively low (i.e., at ages 20–30) in regions with high WMH frequency, prior to white matter macrostructural damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is marked by the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuronal death and synaptic loss, and inflammation in the brain. AD research has, in large part, been dedicated to the understanding of Aβ and NFT deposition as well as to the pharmacological reduction of these hallmarks. However, recent GWAS data indicates neuroinflammation plays a critical role in AD development, thereby redirecting research efforts toward unveiling the complexities of AD-associated neuroinflammation. It is clear that the innate immune system is intimately associated with AD progression, however, the specific roles of glia and neuroinflammation in AD pathology remain to be described. Moreover, inflammatory processes have largely been painted as detrimental to AD pathology, when in fact, many immune mechanisms such as phagocytosis aid in the reduction of AD pathologies. In this review, we aim to outline the delicate balance between the beneficial and detrimental aspects of immune activation in AD as a more thorough understanding of these processes is critical to development of effective therapeutics for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) that are spreading into new territories is an important goal of vaccine design. To define bNAb targets, we characterized 28 antibodies belonging to expanded and hypermutated clonal families identified by transcriptomic analysis of single plasmablasts from DENV-infected individuals. Among these, we identified J9 and J8, two somatically related bNAbs that potently neutralized DENV1-4. Mutagenesis studies showed that the major recognition determinants of these bNAbs are in E protein domain I, distinct from the only known class of human bNAbs against DENV with a well-defined epitope. B cell repertoire analysis from acute-phase peripheral blood suggested that J9 and J8 followed divergent somatic hypermutation pathways, and that a limited number of mutations was sufficient for neutralizing activity. Our study suggests multiple B cell evolutionary pathways leading to DENV bNAbs targeting a new epitope that can be exploited for vaccine design.</description>

	<description>The retina has a very high energy demand but lacks an internal blood supply in most vertebrates. Here we explore the hypothesis that oxygen diffusion limited the evolution of retinal morphology by reconstructing the evolution of retinal thickness and the various mechanisms for retinal oxygen supply, including capillarization and acid-induced haemoglobin oxygen unloading. We show that a common ancestor of bony fishes likely had a thin retina without additional retinal oxygen supply mechanisms and that three different types of retinal capillaries were gained and lost independently multiple times during the radiation of vertebrates, and that these were invariably associated with parallel changes in retinal thickness. Since retinal thickness confers multiple advantages to vision, we propose that insufficient retinal oxygen supply constrained the functional evolution of the eye in early vertebrates, and that recurrent origins of additional retinal oxygen supply mechanisms facilitated the phenotypic evolution of improved functional eye morphology.</description>

	<description>Instantaneous brain states have consequences for our sensation, perception, and behaviour. Fluctuations in arousal and neural desynchronization likely pose perceptually relevant states. However, their relationship and their relative impact on perception is unclear. We here show that, at the single-trial level in humans, local desynchronization in sensory cortex (expressed as time-series entropy) versus pupil-linked arousal differentially impact perceptual processing. While we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry data, stimuli of a demanding auditory discrimination task were presented into states of high or low desynchronization of auditory cortex via a real-time closed-loop setup. Desynchronization and arousal distinctly influenced stimulus-evoked activity and shaped behaviour displaying an inverted u-shaped relationship: States of intermediate desynchronization elicited minimal response bias and fastest responses, while states of intermediate arousal gave rise to highest response sensitivity. Our results speak to a model in which independent states of local desynchronization and global arousal jointly optimise sensory processing and performance.</description>

	<description>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays an important role in dendritic translation and in learning and memory. We previously showed that heavy alcohol use activates mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rodents (1). Here, we set out to determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation in the OFC. We found that inhibition of mTORC1 activity attenuates alcohol seeking and restores sensitivity to outcome devaluation in rats that habitually seek alcohol. In contrast, habitual responding for sucrose was unaltered by mTORC1 inhibition, suggesting that mTORC1's role in habitual behavior is specific to alcohol. We further show that inhibition of GluN2B in the OFC attenuates alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation, alcohol seeking and habitual responding for alcohol. Together, these data suggest that the GluN2B/mTORC1 axis in the OFC drives alcohol seeking and habit.</description>

	<description>The lenticular fiber cells are comprised of extremely long-lived proteins while still maintaining an active biochemical state. Dysregulation of these activities has been implicated in diseases such as age-related cataracts. However, the lenticular protein dynamics underlying health and disease is unclear. We sought to measure the global protein turnover rates in the eye using nitrogen-15 labeling of mice and mass spectrometry. We measured the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-peptide ratios of 248 lens proteins, including Crystallin, Aquaporin, Collagen and enzymes that catalyze glycolysis and oxidation/reduction reactions. Direct comparison of lens cortex versus nucleus revealed little or no &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-protein contents in most nuclear proteins, while there were a broad range of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N ratios in cortex proteins. Unexpectedly, like Crystallins, many enzymes with relatively high abundance in nucleus were also exceedingly long-lived. The slow replacement of these enzymes in spite of young age of mice suggests their potential roles in age-related metabolic changes in the lens.</description>

Pluripotent stem cells retain the developmental timing of their species of origin &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, an observation that suggests the existence of a cell-intrinsic developmental clock, yet the nature and machinery of the clock remain a mystery. We hypothesize that one possible component may lie in species-specific differences in the kinetics of transcriptional responses to differentiation signals. Using a liquid-handling robot, mouse and human pluripotent stem cells were exposed to identical neural differentiation conditions and sampled for RNA-sequencing at high frequency, every 4 or 10 minutes, for the first 10 hours of differentiation to test for differences in transcriptomic response rates. The majority of initial transcriptional responses occurred within a rapid window in the first minutes of differentiation for both human and mouse stem cells. Despite similarly early onsets of gene expression changes, we observed shortened and condensed gene expression patterns in mouse pluripotent stem cells compared to protracted trends in human pluripotent stem cells. Moreover, the speed at which individual genes were upregulated, as measured by the slopes of gene expression changes over time, was significantly faster in mouse compared to human cells. These results suggest that downstream transcriptomic response kinetics to signaling cues are faster in mouse versus human cells, and may offer a partial account for the vast differences in developmental rates across species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z0YpHSJTzsQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tuure Hameri, Marc-Olivier Boldi, Vassily Hatzimanikatis&lt;/p&gt;

Kinetic models of metabolism can be constructed to predict cellular regulation and devise metabolic engineering strategies, and various promising computational workflows have been developed in recent years for this. Due to the uncertainty in the kinetic parameter values required to build kinetic models, these workflows rely on ensemble modeling (EM) principles for sampling and building populations of models describing observed physiologies. Sensitivity coefficients from metabolic control analysis (MCA) of kinetic models can provide important insight about cellular control around a given physiological steady state. However, despite considering populations of kinetic models and their model outputs, current approaches do not provide adequate tools for statistical inference. To derive conclusions from model outputs, such as MCA sensitivity coefficients, it is necessary to rank/compare populations of variables with each other. Currently existing workflows consider confidence intervals (CIs) that are derived independently for each comparable variable. Hence, it is important to derive simultaneous CIs for the variables that we wish to rank/compare. Herein, we used an existing large-scale kinetic model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia Coli&lt;/i&gt; metabolism to present how univariate CIs can lead to incorrect conclusions, and we present a new workflow that applies three different multivariate statistical approaches. We use the Bonferroni and the exact normal methods to build symmetric CIs using the normality assumptions. We then suggest how bootstrapping can compute asymmetric CIs whilst relaxing this normality assumption. We conclude that the Bonferroni and the exact normal methods can provide simple and efficient ways for constructing reliable CIs, with the exact normal method favored over the Bonferroni when the compared variables present dependencies. Bootstrapping, despite its significantly higher computational cost, is recommended when comparing non-normal distributions of variables. Additionally, we show how the Bonferroni method can readily be used to estimate required sample numbers to attain a certain CI size.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ndcQBu6F3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Next-generation sequencing based base-by-base distance measures have become an integral complement to epidemiological investigation of infectious disease outbreaks. This study introduces PANPASCO, a computational pan-genome mapping based, pairwise distance method that is highly sensitive to differences between cases, even when located in regions of lineage specific reference genomes. We show that our approach is superior to previously published methods in several datasets and across different &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lineages, as its characteristics allow the comparison of a high number of diverse samples in one analysis—a scenario that becomes more and more likely with the increased usage of whole-genome sequencing in transmission surveillance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9Y8N1IdMUDQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neural systems can be modeled as complex networks in which neural elements are represented as nodes linked to one another through structural or functional connections. The resulting network can be analyzed using mathematical tools from network science and graph theory to quantify the system’s topological organization and to better understand its function. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record spontaneous activity from the same set of cells in mouse auditory cortex over the course of several weeks. We reconstruct functional networks in which cells are linked to one another by edges weighted according to the correlation of their fluorescence traces. We show that the networks exhibit modular structure across multiple topological scales and that these multi-scale modules unfold as part of a hierarchy. We also show that, on average, network architecture becomes increasingly dissimilar over time, with similarity decaying monotonically with the distance (in time) between sessions. Finally, we show that a small fraction of cells maintain strongly-correlated activity over multiple days, forming a stable temporal core surrounded by a fluctuating and variable periphery. Our work indicates a framework for studying spontaneous activity measured by two-photon calcium imaging using computational methods and graphical models from network science. The methods are flexible and easily extended to additional datasets, opening the possibility of studying cellular level network organization of neural systems and how that organization is modulated by stimuli or altered in models of disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t7RYcVGLyww&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Despite the discovery of gene variants linked to memory performance, understanding the genetic basis of adult human memory remains a challenge. Here, we devised an unsupervised framework that relies on spatial correlations between human transcriptome data and functional neuroimaging maps to uncover the genetic signatures of memory in functionally-defined cortical and subcortical memory regions. Results were validated with animal literature and showed that our framework is highly effective in identifying memory-related processes and genes compared to a control cognitive function. Genes preferentially expressed in cortical memory regions are linked to memory-related processes such as immune and epigenetic regulation. Genes expressed in subcortical memory regions are associated with neurogenesis and glial cell differentiation. Genes expressed in both cortical and subcortical memory areas are involved in the regulation of transcription, synaptic plasticity and glutamate receptor signalling. Furthermore, distinct memory-associated genes such as &lt;i&gt;PRKCD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CDK5&lt;/i&gt; are linked to cortical and subcortical regions respectively. Thus, cortical and subcortical memory regions exhibit distinct genetic signatures that potentially reflect functional differences in health and disease, and nominates gene candidates for future experimental investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The anatomical and functional aspects of human memory are well characterized, but its biological mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, to uncover genetic signatures associated with human memory function, we analyzed spatial correlations between micro-scale gene expression and macro-scale neuroimaging maps to derive memory-related biological processes and genes in an unsupervised manner. We found the gene signatures of cortical and subcortical memory to be largely distinct and are associated with memory. We identified less characterized memory-associated genes as well. Furthermore, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and precision in identifying gene signatures related to memory versus another function as a control. Overall, our work provides a human-centric approach to understanding the genetics of cognition, and identifies potential gene candidates for future experimental investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Damage in biological neuronal networks triggers a complex functional reorganization whose mechanisms are still poorly understood. To delineate this reorganization process, here we investigate the functional alterations of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; rat cortical circuits following localized laser ablation. The analysis of the functional network configuration before and after ablation allowed us to quantify the extent of functional alterations and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales along recovery. We observed that damage precipitated a fast rerouting of information flow that restored network’s communicability in about 15 min. Functional restoration was led by the immediate neighbors around trauma but was orchestrated by the entire network. Our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; setup exposes the ability of neuronal circuits to articulate fast responses to acute damage, and may serve as a proxy to devise recovery strategies in actual brain circuits. Moreover, this biological setup can become a benchmark to empirically test network theories about the spontaneous recovery in dynamical networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Given the sheer size of the brain, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models in the form of neuronal cultures have emerged as a promising tool to investigate dynamic and network alterations in detail upon physical damage. Here we present a new experimental paradigm based on the combination of laser microsurgery and calcium fluorescence imaging to analyze network functional alterations after a focal lesion. We show that the network is not only able to cope with damage but that the regions around the lesion core actively participate in recovery, restoring the initial network activity levels in just 15 min. Our approach offers interesting perspectives for modeling network functional loss and recovery in a number of damage actions, from stroke to degenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Environmental Enrichment Partially Repairs Subcortical Mapping Errors in Ten-m3 Knock-Out Mice during an Early Critical Period</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to improve neural function via the regulation of cortical plasticity. Its capacity to induce functional and/or anatomical repair of miswired circuits is unknown. Ten-m3 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit a highly stereotyped and profound miswiring of ipsilateral retinogeniculate axons and associated deficits in binocularly-mediated visual behavior. We determined whether, and when, EE can drive the repair of subcortical wiring deficits by analyzing Ten-m3 KO and wild-type (WT) mice that were enriched for six weeks from adulthood, weaning or birth in comparison to standard-housed (SE) controls. Six weeks of EE initiated from birth, but not later, induced a significant reduction in the area occupied by ipsilateral retinogeniculate terminals in KOs. No EE-induced correction of mistargeted axons was observed at postnatal day (P)7, indicating that this intervention impacts pruning rather than initial targeting of axons. This reduction was most prominent in the ventrolateral region of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), suggesting a preferential pruning of the most profoundly mistargeted axons. EE can thus partially repair a specific, subcortical axonal wiring deficit, but only during an early, developmentally-restricted time window.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Threat Anticipation in Pulvinar and in Superficial Layers of Primary Visual Cortex (V1). Evidence from Layer-Specific Ultra-High Field 7T fMRI</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The perceptual system gives priority to threat-relevant signals with survival value. In addition to the processing initiated by sensory inputs of threat signals, prioritization of threat signals may also include processes related to threat anticipation. These neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using ultra-high-field 7 tesla (7T) fMRI, we show that anticipatory processing takes place in the early stages of visual processing, specifically in the pulvinar and V1. When anticipation of a threat-relevant fearful face target triggered false perception of not-presented target, there was enhanced activity in the pulvinar as well as in the V1 superficial-cortical-depth (layers 1–3). The anticipatory activity was absent in the LGN or higher visual cortical areas (V2–V4). The effect in V1 was specific to the perception of fearful face targets and did not generalize to happy face targets. A preliminary analysis showed that the connectivity between the pulvinar and V1 superficial-cortical-depth was enhanced during false perception of threat, indicating that the pulvinar and V1 may interact in preparation of anticipated threat. The anticipatory processing supported by the pulvinar and V1 may play an important role in non-sensory-input-driven anxiety states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Although within-modality sensory plasticity is limited to early developmental periods, cross-modal plasticity can occur even in adults. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological studies have shown that transient visual deprivation (dark exposure, DE) in adult mice improves the frequency selectivity and discrimination of neurons in thalamorecipient layer 4 (L4) of primary auditory cortex (A1). Since sound information is processed hierarchically in A1 by populations of neurons, we investigated whether DE alters network activity in A1 L4 and layer 2/3 (L2/3). We examined neuronal populations in both L4 and L2/3 using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) imaging of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s. We find that one week of DE in adult mice increased the sound evoked responses and frequency selectivity of both L4 and L2/3 neurons. Moreover, after DE the frequency representation changed with L4 and L2/3 showing a reduced representation of cells with best frequencies (BFs) between 8 and 16 kHz and an increased representation of cells with BFs above 32 kHz. Cells in L4 and L2/3 showed decreased pairwise signal correlations (SCs) consistent with sharper tuning curves. The decreases in SCs were larger in L4 than in L2/3. The decreased pairwise correlations indicate a sparsification of A1 responses to tonal stimuli. Thus, cross-modal experience in adults can both alter the sound-evoked responses of A1 neurons and change activity correlations within A1 potentially enhancing the encoding of auditory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomics, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and a spatial motor
virtual reality task were integrated using mediation analysis in a novel
demonstration of &quot;imaging omics&quot;. Data collected in NCAA Division I football
athletes cleared for play before in-season training showed significant
relationships in a) elevated levels of miR-30d and miR-92a to elevated putamen
rCBF, (b) elevated putamen rCBF to compromised balance scores, and (c)
compromised balance scores to elevated miRNA levels. rCBF acted as a mediator
variable (minimum 70% mediation, significant Sobel's test) between abnormal
miRNA levels and compromised balance scores. Given the involvement of these
miRNAs in inflammation and immune function, and that vascular perfusion is a
component of the inflammatory response, these findings support a chronic
inflammatory model of repetitive head acceleration events (HAEs). rCBF, a
systems biology measure, was necessary for miRNA to affect behavior. These
results suggest miRNA as a potential diagnostic biomarker for repetitive HAEs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate identification of brain function is necessary to understand the
neurobiology of cognitive ageing, and thereby promote well-being across the
lifespan. A common tool used to investigate neurocognitive ageing is functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, although fMRI data are often
interpreted in terms of neuronal activity, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) signal measured by fMRI includes contributions of both vascular and
neuronal factors, which change differentially with age. While some studies
investigate vascular ageing factors, the results of these studies are not well
known within the field of neurocognitive ageing and therefore vascular
confounds in neurocognitive fMRI studies are common. In contrast to over 10,000
BOLD-fMRI papers on ageing, fewer than 20 have applied techniques to correct
for vascular effects. However, neurovascular ageing is not only a confound in
fMRI, but an important feature in its own right, to be assessed alongside
measures of neuronal ageing. We review current approaches to dissociate
neuronal and vascular components of BOLD-fMRI of regional activity and
functional connectivity. We highlight emerging evidence that vascular
mechanisms in the brain do not simply control blood flow to support the
metabolic needs of neurons, but form complex neurovascular interactions that
influence neuronal function in health and disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Built to Last: Functional and structural mechanisms in the moth olfactory network mitigate effects of neural injury. (arXiv:1808.01279v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most organisms suffer neuronal damage throughout their lives, which can
impair performance of core behaviors. Their neural circuits need to maintain
function despite injury, which in particular requires preserving key system
outputs. In this work, we explore whether and how certain structural and
functional neuronal network motifs act as injury mitigation mechanisms.
Specifically, we examine how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise,
and (iii) parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to the
robustness of the olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth. We simulate
injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory network
calibrated to in vivo data. The injuries are modeled on focal axonal swellings,
a ubiquitous form of axonal pathology observed in traumatic brain injuries and
other brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon, reducing the effective neural firing rate delivered
to downstream neurons. All three of the network motifs examined significantly
mitigate the effects of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's
impact on readout neuron responses or by restoring these responses to
pre-injury levels. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their value
as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural injury.
More generally, robustness to injury is a vital design principle to consider
when analyzing neural systems. Indeed, it is possible that some neural
structures and mechanisms, including the ability to learn, are best understood
as evolutionary solutions to the challenge of maintaining system function
despite injury.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression provides a multi-scale description of acid stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Response to acid stress is critical for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to successfully complete its life-cycle by passing through the stomach to colonize the digestive tract. To develop a fundamental understanding of this response, we established a molecular mechanistic description of acid stress mitigation responses in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and integrated them with a genome-scale model of its metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-model). We considered three known mechanisms of acid stress mitigation: 1) change in membrane lipid fatty acid composition, 2) change in periplasmic protein stability over external pH and periplasmic chaperone protection mechanisms, and 3) change in the activities of membrane proteins. After integrating these mechanisms into an established ME-model, we could simulate their responses in the context of other cellular processes. We validated these simulations using RNA sequencing data obtained from five &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains grown under external pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.0. We found: i) that for the differentially expressed genes accounted for in the ME-model, 80% of the upregulated genes were correctly predicted by the ME-model, and ii) that these genes are mainly involved in translation processes (45% of genes), membrane proteins and related processes (18% of genes), amino acid metabolism (12% of genes), and cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis (8% of genes). We also demonstrated several intervention strategies on acid tolerance that can be simulated by the ME-model. We thus established a quantitative framework that describes, on a genome-scale, the acid stress mitigation response of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; that has both scientific and practical uses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fr0qkVTH3w0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The goal of many single-cell studies on eukaryotic cells is to gain insight into the biochemical reactions that control cell fate and state. In this paper we introduce the concept of Effective Stoichiometric Spaces (ESS) to guide the reconstruction of biochemical networks from multiplexed, fixed time-point, single-cell data. In contrast to methods based solely on statistical models of data, the ESS method leverages the power of the geometric theory of toric varieties to begin unraveling the structure of chemical reaction networks (CRN). This application of toric theory enables a data-driven mapping of covariance relationships in single-cell measurements into stoichiometric information, one in which each cell subpopulation has its associated ESS interpreted in terms of CRN theory. In the development of ESS we reframe certain aspects of the theory of CRN to better match data analysis. As an application of our approach we process cytomery- and image-based single-cell datasets and identify differences in cells treated with kinase inhibitors. Our approach is directly applicable to data acquired using readily accessible experimental methods such as Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and multiplex immunofluorescence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-HbVuPEIzs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The gut microbiota, the collection of microorganisms residing in intestines of vertebrates, was shown to have major effects on host physiology. The field has seen a renaissance due to advances in deep-sequencing. Recently, there is an explosion of studies on the physiological and therapeutic potential of the gut microbiota. These microbes are considered to reside in symbiosis with their hosts, and are termed ‘commensals’, originated from Latin — ‘at table together’. We provide the gut microbes nutrients and a living niche, and they in turn, provide us with essentially the same — nutrients derived from the food we eat, that we cannot digest, and essential functions for health and longevity. In the past few years it has been appreciated that gut microbes can even affect our brain, behavior, and neurological disorders, which we here review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Indeed, the meninges are an immunologically active compartment that communicates with the periphery via the (re)discovered meningeal lymphatic system. From its ties to both the periphery and the central nervous system, the meninges are becoming a prevalent organ to understand and modulate brain homeostasis. Here we will focus on current advances in our understanding of the meningeal compartment with an emphasis on the meningeal lymphatic network as a key regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In the gut, commensal microbiota or pathobionts secrete metabolites that underlie pathological conditions, often impacting proximal tissues and gaining access to the bloodstream. Here we focus on extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting composition of gut microbiota and their impact on the immune system, as key drivers of anti-tumor immunity. In discussing exciting advances relevant to microbiome-tumor interaction, we note existing knowledge gaps that need to be filled to advance basic and clinical research initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The growing knowledge on mediators and triggered pathways has advanced our understanding of the interactions along the gut-brain axis. Gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds and can modulate neuronal function, plasticity and behavior. Furthermore, intestinal microorganisms impact the host’s metabolism and immune status which in turn affect neuronal pathways in the enteric and central nervous systems. Here, we discuss the recent insights from human studies and animal models on the bi-directional communication along the microbiome-gut-brain axis in both acute and chronic brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Literally hundreds of statisticians have rightly called for an end to statistical significance testing (Amrhein et al., 2019; Wasserstein et al., 2019). But the practice of arbitrarily thresholding &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values is not only deeply embedded in statistical practice, it is also congenial to the human mind. It is thus not sufficient to tell our students, &quot;Don’t do this.&quot; We must vividly show them why the practice is wrong and its effects detrimental to scientific progress. I offer three teaching examples I have found to be useful in prompting students to think more deeply about the problem and to begin to interpret the results of statistical procedures as measures of how evidence should change our beliefs, and not as bright lines separating truth from falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Phase/amplitude synchronization of brain signals during motor imagery BCI tasks. (arXiv:1912.02745v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extraction of brain functioning features is a crucial step in the
definition of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In the last decade, functional
connectivity (FC) estimators have been increasingly explored based on their
ability to capture synchronization between multivariate brain signals. However,
the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and the extent to which they can
improve performance in BCI-related tasks, is still poorly understood. To
address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects
during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two
well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and
investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the
resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG
sensor and compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power
spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while
spectral-coherence based network features were increasing the controlateral
motor area, those based on imaginary-coherence were decreasing. We demonstrated
that this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by
the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals.
At the individual level, we proved that including these network connectivity
features in the classification of MI mental states led to an overall
improvement in accuracy. Taken together, our results provide fresh insights
into the oscillatory mechanisms subserving brain network changes during MI and
offer new perspectives to improve BCI performance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Investigation of ephaptic interactions in peripheral nerve of sheep using 6 kHz subthreshold currents. (arXiv:1912.02331v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this work was to determine whether application of
subthreshold currents to the peripheral nerve increases the excitability of the
underlying nerve fibres, and how this increased excitability would alter neural
activity as it propagates through the subthreshold currents. Experiments were
performed on two Romney cross-breed sheep in vivo, by applying subthreshold
currents either at the stimulus site or between the stimulus and recording
sites. Neural recordings were obtained from nerve cuff implanted on the
peroneal or sciatic nerve branches, while stimulus was applied to either the
peroneal nerve or pins placed through the lower hindshank. Results showed that
subthreshold currents applied to the same site as stimulus increased excitation
of underlying nerve fibres (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). With stimulus and subthreshold
currents applied to different sites on the peroneal nerve, the primary CAP in
the sciatic displayed a temporal shift of -2.5 to -3 us which agreed with
statistically significant changes in the CAP waveform (p&amp;lt;0.02). These findings
contribute to the understanding of mechanisms in myelinated fibres of
subthreshold current neuromodulation therapies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Identifying Super-Feminine, Super-Masculine and Sex-Defining Connections in the Human Braingraph. (arXiv:1912.02291v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02291</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade now, we can discover and study thousands of cerebral
connections with the application of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)
techniques and the accompanying algorithmic workflow. While numerous
connectomical results were published enlightening the relation between the
braingraph and certain biological, medical, and psychological properties, it is
still a great challenge to identify a small number of brain connections,
closely related to those conditions. In the present contribution, by applying
the 1200 Subjects Release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we identify
just 102 connections out of the total number of 1950 connections in the
83-vertex graphs of 1065 subjects, which -- by a simple linear test --
precisely, without any error determine the sex of the subject. Very
surprisingly, we were able to identify two graph edges out of these 102, if,
whose weights, measured in fiber numbers, are all high, then the connectome
always belongs to a female subject, independently of the other edges.
Similarly, we have identified 3 edges from these 102, whose weights, if two of
them are high and one is low, imply that the graph belongs to a male subject --
again, independently of the other edges. We call the former 2 edges
superfeminine and the first two of the 3 edges supermasculine edges of the
human connectome. Even more interestingly, one of the edges, connecting the
right Pars Triangularis and the right Superior Parietal areas, is one of the 2
superfeminine edges, and it is also the third edge, accompanying the two
supermasculine connections, if its weight is low; therefore it is also a
&quot;switching&quot; connection.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Can Transfer Entropy Infer Information Flow in Neuronal Circuits for Cognitive Processing?. (arXiv:1901.07589v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07589</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07589</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To infer information flow in any network of agents, it is important first and
foremost to establish causal temporal relations between the nodes. Practical
and automated methods that can infer causality are difficult to find, and the
subject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only detects
correlation, there are several information-theoretic notions of &quot;directed
information&quot; that have successfully detected causality in some systems, in
particular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has shown that
some directed information measures can sometimes inadequately estimate the
extent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing cause-effect
relations between components of systems, especially if neurons contribute in a
cryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we test how often
cryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that generates
artificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks: motion
detection and sound localization. We also test whether activity time-series
recorded from behaving digital brains can infer information flow using the
transfer entropy concept, when compared to a ground-truth model of causal
influence constructed from connectivity and circuit logic. Our results suggest
that transfer entropy will sometimes fail to infer causality when it exists,
and sometimes suggest a causal connection when there is none. However, the
extent of incorrect inference strongly depends on the cognitive task
considered. These results emphasize the importance of understanding the
fundamental logic processes that contribute to information flow in cognitive
processing, and quantifying their relevance in any given nervous system.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biological neural networks produce information backgrounds of multi-scale spontaneous activity that become more complex in brain states displaying higher capacities for cognition, for instance, attentive awake versus asleep or anesthetized states. Here, we review brain state-dependent mechanisms spanning ion channel currents (microscale) to the dynamics of brain-wide, distributed, transient functional assemblies (macroscale). Not unlike how microscopic interactions between molecules underlie structures formed in macroscopic states of matter, using statistical physics, the dynamics of microscopic neural phenomena can be linked to macroscopic brain dynamics through mesoscopic scales. Beyond spontaneous dynamics, it is observed that stimuli evoke collapses of complexity, most remarkable over high dimensional, asynchronous, irregular background dynamics during consciousness. In contrast, complexity may not be further collapsed beyond synchrony and regularity characteristic of unconscious spontaneous activity. We propose that increased dimensionality of spontaneous dynamics during conscious states supports responsiveness, enhancing neural networks' emergent capacity to robustly encode information over multiple scales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the study of memory engrams, synaptic memory allocation is a newly emerged theme that focuses on how specific synapses are engaged in the storage of a given memory. Cumulating evidence from imaging and molecular experiments indicates that the recruitment of synapses that participate in the encoding and expression of memory is neither random nor uniform. A hallmark observation is the emergence of groups of synapses that share similar response properties and/or similar input properties and are located within a stretch of a dendritic branch. This grouping of synapses has been termed “synapse clustering” and has been shown to emerge in many different memory-related paradigms, as well as in in vitro studies. The clustering of synapses may emerge from synapses receiving similar input, or via many processes which allow for cross-talk between nearby synapses within a dendritic branch, leading to cooperative plasticity. Clustered synapses can act in concert to maximally exploit the nonlinear integration potential of the dendritic branches in which they reside. Their main contribution is to facilitate the induction of dendritic spikes and dendritic plateau potentials, which provide advanced computational and memory-related capabilities to dendrites and single neurons. This review focuses on recent evidence which investigates the role of synapse clustering in dendritic integration, sensory perception, learning, and memory as well as brain dysfunction. We also discuss recent theoretical work which explores the computational advantages provided by synapse clustering, leading to novel and revised theories of memory. As an eminent phenomenon during memory allocation, synapse clustering both shapes memory engrams and is also shaped by the parallel plasticity mechanisms upon which it relies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The scientific landscape surrounding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continues to shift as the number of genes associated with the disease risk and pathogenesis, and the cellular processes involved, continues to grow. Despite decades of intense research and over 50 potentially causative or disease-modifying genes identified, etiology remains unexplained and treatment options remain limited for the majority of ALS patients. Various factors have contributed to the slow progress in understanding and developing therapeutics for this disease. Here, we review the genetic basis of ALS, highlighting factors that have contributed to the elusiveness of genetic heritability. The most commonly mutated ALS-linked genes are reviewed with an emphasis on disease-causing mechanisms. The cellular processes involved in ALS pathogenesis are discussed, with evidence implicating their involvement in ALS summarized. Past and present therapeutic strategies and the benefits and limitations of the model systems available to ALS researchers are discussed with future directions for research that may lead to effective treatment strategies outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention plays a fundamental role in acquiring and understanding information. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate attention objectively in such fields as education and mental health. Aimed at extracting objective indicators of attention from physiological signals, this study examined the characteristics of electroencephalography (EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and pupil diameter signals during a free recall task. The objective was to clarify the temporal characteristics of these signals in relation to attention. We used a free recall task as a cognitive task with an attentional load. The participants attempted to memorize and then recall 13 serially presented words. Our hypothesis was that the significant physiological responses should differ depending on the time scale of the attention evaluation. The physiological responses were compared on the basis of differences between success and failure to recall a word on a short time scale, in terms of the attentional state among five serial position groups on a middle time scale, and on the basis of differences between trials with many and few words recalled on a long time scale. We found that the response of each physiological signal depended on the attention in the different time-scale comparisons. (1) The P300 amplitudes of the EEG signals for the words that were recalled were significantly higher than those for the words that were not recalled. (2) Pupillary dilation differed significantly depending on the serial position group. (3) Functional connectivity in the right hemisphere revealed by NIRS was significantly stronger in trials with many words recalled than in those with few words recalled. Different temporal characteristics of physiological signals with respect to attention were suggested by multimodal measurement and multiple-time-scale analysis. Consideration of these characteristics should help in the development of applications requiring objective attention evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating problem in patients with PD. The multifactorial pathogenesis of FoG remains poorly understood. We aimed to find which factors are most strongly associated with the occurrence of FoG.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Three hundred five PD patients were enrolled and subdivided according to the presence (FoG +, n = 128) or absence (FoG-, n = 177) of FoG. Several clinical, functional, and neuropsychological data were collected and compared between groups. The association between the probability of presence of FoG and possible explanatory variables was assessed by logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;FoG + patients were younger at the diagnosis (p = 0.04), and their mean daily dose of dopaminergic drugs (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) was higher in comparison with FoG- patients. FoG + patients get worse in Frontal Assessment Battery (p = 0.005), had higher scores in Apathy Evaluation Scale (p = 0.03), and were much more impaired on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (p = 0.018), Trail Making Test A (p = 0.0013), and Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Test (p = 0.012). Levodopa equivalent dose, age (direct), age at disease onset (inverse), and WCST were significant predictors of FoG (p = 0.01, p = 0.0025, p = 0.0016, and p = 0.029, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;FoG + patients show more deficits in executive functions and in motivation. The main explanatory variables of FoG occurrence are levodopa equivalent dose, age, age at disease onset, and WCST. These data suggest that a specific involvement of frontal cortical circuits in PD is responsible for certain cognitive–behavioral alterations related to the occurrence of FoG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. More than 25 ALS-related genes have been identified, accounting for approximately 10% of sporadic ALS (SALS) and two-thirds of familial ALS (FALS) cases. Several recent studies showed that genetic factors might have a larger contribution to young-onset ALS than to ALS cases overall. However, the genetic profile of young-onset ALS patients is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated a cohort of 27 young-onset ALS patients (onset age &amp;lt; 45 years) through whole-exome sequencing (WES). Genetic analysis identified pathogenic variants of FUS (25.9%), SOD1 (22.2%), TARDBP (3.7%), and VCP (3.7%) in 27 young-onset ALS patients. Of 12 identified types of mutations, c.1528A &amp;gt; C in FUS and c.266G &amp;gt; A in VCP were novel. All of the cases in this study reflect a monogenic origin with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Notably, a novel de novo missense mutation, c.1528A &amp;gt; C (p.K510Q), in FUS was identified in a 29-year-old ALS patient. Expression of the K510Q mutant FUS resulted in cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS in cultured cells and induced neural toxicity in a fly model. This study provides further evidence of the genetic profile of young-onset ALS patients from China and expands the mutational spectrum of the FUS gene, with one new K510Q mutation identified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Performance and Material-Dependent Holistic Representation of Unconscious Thought: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00418</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychological research has demonstrated that humans can think unconsciously. Unconscious thought (UT) refers to cognitive or affective decision-related processes that occur beyond conscious awareness. UT processes are considered more effective in complex decision-making than conscious thought (CT). In addition, holistic representation plays a key role in UT and consists of a multimodal, value-related cognitive process. While the neural correlates of UT have recently been investigated, the holistic representation hypothesis of UT has not been confirmed. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to further evaluate this hypothesis by utilizing two UT tasks (person and consumer-product evaluations) in conjunction with an improved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental protocol. Participants evaluated four alternatives with 12 attributes each. In the UT condition, once the decision information had been presented, the participants completed a 1-back task for 120 s and evaluated each alternative, as well as an independent 1-back task in the absence of any decision information. We then performed regression analysis of the UT performance in both tasks. Our results revealed a positive correlation between performance in the UT task and the use of the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule in the person evaluation task and between performance and the posterior part of the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and superior parietal lobule in the consumer-product evaluation task. The involvement of the precuneus area in both tasks was indicative of a multimodal, value-related process and is consistent with the features of holistic representation, supporting a central role for holistic representation in UT. Furthermore, the involvement of different precuneus subregions in the two UT tasks may reflect the task dependency of the key representation critical for advantageous UT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence showed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargoes are important information mediators in the nervous system and have been proposed to play an important role in regulating regeneration. Moreover, many studies reported that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) conditioned medium is capable of promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. However, the role of EVs derived from OECs in axonal regeneration has not been clear. Thereby, the present study was designed to firstly isolate EVs from OECs culture supernatants, and then investigated their role in enhancing axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve injury. In vitro studies showed that OECs-EVs promoted axonal growth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which is dose-dependent and relies on their integrity. In vivo studies further demonstrated that nerve conduit containing OECs-EVs significantly enhanced axonal regeneration, myelination of regenerated axons and neurologically functional recovery in rats with sciatic nerve injury. In conclusion, our results, for the first time, demonstrated that OECs-EVs are capable of promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microvascular complications are often associated with slow and progressive damage of various organs. Pericytes are multi-functional mural cells of the microcirculation that control blood flow, vascular permeability and homeostasis. Whereas accumulating evidence suggests that these cells are also implicated in a variety of diseases, pericytes represent promising targets that can be manipulated for therapeutic gain. Here, we review the role of pericytes in angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, neuroinflammation, tissue fibrosis, axon regeneration failure, and neurodegeneration. In addition, we outline strategies altering pericyte behavior to point out problems and promises for axon regeneration and central nervous system (CNS) repair following injury or disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Facilitation of Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract Microbiome-Derived Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Entry Into Human Neurons by Amyloid Beta-42 (Aβ42) Peptide</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00545</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS): (i) has been recently shown to target, accumulate within, and eventually encapsulate neuronal nuclei of the human central nervous system (CNS) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain; and (ii) this action appears to impede and restrict the outward flow of genetic information from neuronal nuclei. It has previously been shown that in LPS-encased neuronal nuclei in AD brain there is a specific disruption in the output and expression of two AD-relevant, neuron-specific markers encoding the cytoskeletal neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein and the synaptic phosphoprotein synapsin-1 (SYN1) involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. The biophysical mechanisms involved in the facilitation of the targeting of LPS to neuronal cells and nuclei and eventual nuclear envelopment and functional disruption are not entirely clear. In this “Perspectives article” we discuss current advances, and consider future directions in this research area, and provide novel evidence in human neuronal-glial (HNG) cells in primary culture that the co-incubation of LPS with amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) peptide facilitates the association of LPS with neuronal cells. These findings: (i) support a novel pathogenic role for Aβ42 peptides in neurons via the formation of pores across the nuclear membrane and/or a significant biophysical disruption of the neuronal nuclear envelope; and (ii) advance the concept that the Aβ42 peptide-facilitated entry of LPS into brain neurons, accession of neuronal nuclei, and down-regulation of neuron-specific components such as NF-L and SYN1 may contribute significantly to neuropathological deficits as are characteristically observed in AD-affected brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Electroacupuncture Pretreatment Alleviates Cerebral Ischemic Injury Through α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor-Mediated Phenotypic Conversion of Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment alleviates cerebral ischemic injury through α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR). We attempted to investigate whether the phenotypic conversion of microglia was involved in the therapeutic effect of EA pretreatment in cerebral ischemia through α7nAChR. Adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after EA or α7nAChR agonist N-(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl-furo[2,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxamide hydrochloride (PHA-543,613 hydrochloride) and antagonist α-bungarotoxin (α-BGT) pretreatment. Primary microglia were subjected to drug pretreatment and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The expressions of the classical activated phenotype (M1) microglia markers induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86); the alternative activated phenotype (M2) microglia markers arginase-1 (Arg-1), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206); and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the ischemic penumbra or in the supernatant of primary microglia were analyzed. The infarction volume and neurological scores were assessed 72 h after reperfusion. The cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of neurons co-cultured with microglia were analyzed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and LDH release assays. EA pretreatment decreased the expressions of M1 markers (iNOS, IL-1β, and CD86) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), whereas it increased the expressions of M2 markers (Arg-1, TGF-β1, and CD206) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) by activating α7nAChR. EA pretreatment also significantly reduced the infarction volume and improved the neurological deficit. The activation of α7nAChR in microglia relieved the inflammatory response of primary microglia subjected to OGD and attenuated the injury of neurons co-cultured with microglia. In conclusion, EA pretreatment alleviates cerebral ischemic injury through α7nAChR-mediated phenotypic conversion of microglia, which may be a new mechanism for the EA pretreatment-induced neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Forgotten Fibrocytes: A Neglected, Supporting Cell Type of the Cochlea With the Potential to be an Alternative Therapeutic Target in Hearing Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00532</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00532</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cochlear fibrocytes are a homeostatic supporting cell type embedded in the vascularized extracellular matrix of the spiral ligament, within the lateral wall. Here, they participate in the connective tissue syncytium that enables potassium recirculation into the scala media to take place and ensures development of the endolymphatic potential that helps drive current into hair cells during acoustic stimulation. They have also been implicated in inflammatory responses in the cochlea. Some fibrocytes interact closely with the capillaries of the vasculature in a way which suggests potential involvement, together with the stria vascularis, also in the blood-labyrinth barrier. Several lines of evidence suggests that pathology of the fibrocytes, along with other degenerative changes in this region, contribute to metabolic hearing loss (MHL) during aging that is becoming recognized as distinct from, and potentially a precursor for, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This pathology may underlie a significant proportion of cases of presbycusis. Some evidence points also to an association between fibrocyte degeneration and Ménière’s disease (MD). Fibrocytes are mesenchymal; this characteristic, and their location, make them amenable to potential cell therapy in the form of cell replacement or genetic modification to arrest the process of degeneration that leads to MHL. This review explores the properties and roles of this neglected cell type and suggests potential therapeutic approaches, such as cell transplantation or genetic engineering of fibrocytes, which could be used to prevent this form of presbycusis or provide a therapeutic avenue for MD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early Cognitive and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models for Tauopathy and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurocognitive disorders, among which Alzheimer’s disease (AD), have become one of the major causes of death in developed countries. No effective disease-modifying therapy is available, possibly because current treatments are administered too late to still be able to intervene in the disease progress. AD is characterized by a gradual onset with subclinical neurobiological and behavioral changes that precede diagnosis with years to even decades. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier potential treatments can be tested and started. Mouse models are valuable to study the possible causes underlying early phases of neuropathology and their reflection in behavior and other biomarkers, to help improve preclinical detection and diagnosis of AD. Here, we assessed cognitive functioning and social behavior in transgenic mice expressing tau pathology only (Tau-P301L) or a combination of amyloid and tau pathology [amyloid precursor protein (APP)-V717I × Tau-P301L]. The mice were subjected to a variety of behavioral tasks at an age of 3–6 months, i.e., at an early phase of their AD-like pathology. We hypothesized that compared to age-matched wild-type controls, transgenic mice would show specific impairments in both cognitive and non-cognitive tasks. In line with our expectations, transgenic mice showed decreased cognitive flexibility in the Morris water maze, decreased exploratory behavior, decreased performance in a nesting task, and increased anxiety-like behavior. In accordance with the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, some of the behavioral measures showed more severe deficits in APP-V717I × Tau-P301L compared to Tau-P301L mice, indicating an exacerbation of disease processes due to the co-occurrence of amyloid and tau pathology. Our study supports the use of behavioral markers as early indicators of ongoing AD pathology during the preclinical phase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex etiology. Several factors are known to contribute to the disease onset and its progression. However, the complete underlying mechanisms are still escaping our understanding. To evaluate possible correlations between metabolites and metallomic data, in this research, we combined a control study measured using two different platforms. For the different data sources, we applied a Block Sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (Block-sPLS-DA) model that allows for proving their relation, which in turn uncovers alternative influencing factors that remain hidden otherwise. We found two groups of variables that trace a strong relationship between metallomic and metabolomic parameters for disease development. The results confirmed that the redox active metals iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) together with fatty acids are the major influencing factors for the PD. Additionally, the metabolic waste product p-cresol sulfate and the trace element nickel (Ni) showed up as potentially important factors in PD. In summary, the data integration of different types of measurements emphasized the results of both stand-alone measurements providing a new comprehensive set of information and interactions, on PD disease, between different variables sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The number of older people worldwide living with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases is growing at an unprecedented rate. Despite accumulating evidence that engaging in physical activity is a promising primary behavioral strategy to delay or avert the deleterious effects of aging on brain health, a large degree of variation exists in study findings. Thus, before physical activity and exercise can be prescribed as “medicine” for promoting brain health, it is imperative to understand how different biological factors can attenuate or amplify the effects of physical activity on cognition at the individual level. In this review article, we briefly discuss the current state of the literature, examining the relationship between physical activity and brain health in older adults and we present the argument that biological sex is a potent moderator of this relationship. Additionally, we highlight some of the potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying this sex difference for this relatively new and rapidly expanding line of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) has multiple roles in the normal nervous system, including the development of synaptic connections and synaptic plasticity. Research over the past several years has indicated a role for the UPP in aging without any overt pathology in the brain. In addition, malfunction of the UPP is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia associated with it. In this mini review article, we assess the literature on the role of protein degradation by the UPP in aging and in AD with special emphasis on dysregulation of the UPP and its contribution to cognitive decline and impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Recent studies at the interface of the two systems have highlighted important roles of the nervous system in the regulation of both microbicidal pathways and pathogen avoidance behaviors. Studies on the neural circuits in the simple model host &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; have significantly improved our understanding of the roles of conserved neural mechanisms in controlling innate immunity. Moreover, behavioral studies have advanced our understanding of how the nervous system may sense potential pathogens and consequently elicit pathogen avoidance, reducing the risk of infection. In this review, we discuss the neural circuits that regulate both behavioral immunity and molecular immunity in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Enhances Memory Acquisition and Is Associated with Synaptoneurosome Modification in the Rat Hippocampus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation approach previously shown to enhance memory acquisition, but more studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Here, we examined the effects of anodal tDCS (0.25 mA for 30 min) on the memory performance of male Sprague Dawley rats in the passive avoidance test (PAT) and the associated modifications to the hippocampal proteomes. Results indicate anodal tDCS applied before the acquisition period significantly enhanced memory performance in the PAT. Following PAT, synaptoneurosomes were biochemically purified from the hippocampi of tDCS-treated or sham-treated rats and individual protein abundances were determined by bottom-up liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Proteomic analysis identified 184 differentially expressed hippocampal proteins when comparing the sham to the tDCS before memory acquisition treatment group. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed anodal tDCS before memory acquisition significantly enhanced pathways associated with memory, cognition, learning, transmission, neuritogenesis, and long-term potentiation (LTP). IPA identified significant upstream regulators including &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shank3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;gsk3b&lt;/i&gt;. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and protein sequence similarity (PSS) networks show that glutamate receptor pathways, ion channel activity, memory, learning, cognition, and long-term memory were significantly associated with anodal tDCS. Centrality measures from both networks identified key proteins including &lt;i&gt;dlg&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shank&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grin&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;gria&lt;/i&gt; that were significantly modified by tDCS applied before the acquisition period. Together, our results provide descriptive molecular evidence that anodal tDCS enhances memory performance in the PAT by modifying hippocampal synaptic plasticity related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unawareness, or &lt;i&gt;anosognosia&lt;/i&gt;, of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision‐making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta‐amyloid (Aβ) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). Aβ deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aβ predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Aβ burden. Aβ and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (−0.08 discrepant‐points/yr&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;. In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (−0.23 discrepant‐points/yr&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aβ burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self‐awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia diagnosis. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is largely believed that complex cognitive phenomena require the perfect
orchestrated collaboration of many neurons. However, this is not what
converging experimental evidence suggests. Single neurons, the so-called
concept cells, may be responsible for complex tasks performed by an individual.
Here, starting from a few first principles, we layout physical foundations
showing that concept cells are not only possible but highly likely, given that
neurons work in a high dimensional space.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Targeting Alpha-Synuclein as a Therapy for Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00299</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00299</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with a global burden of approximately 6.1 million patients. Alpha-synuclein has been linked to both the sporadic and familial forms of the disease. Moreover, alpha-synuclein is present in Lewy-bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, and the protein and its aggregation have been widely linked to neurotoxic pathways that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. Such pathways include autophagy/lysosomal dysregulation, synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress. Alpha-synuclein has not only been shown to alter cellular pathways but also to spread between cells, causing aggregation in host cells. Therapeutic approaches will need to address several, if not all, of these angles of alpha-synuclein toxicity. Here we review the current advances in therapeutic efforts for PD that aim to produce a disease-modifying therapy by targeting the spread, production, aggregation, and degradation of alpha-synuclein. These include: receptor blocking strategies whereby putative alpha-synuclein receptors could be blocked inhibiting alpha-synuclein spread, an alpha-synuclein reduction which will decrease the amount alpha-synuclein available for aggregation and pathway disruption, the use of small molecules in order to target alpha-synuclein aggregation, immunotherapy and the increase of alpha-synuclein degradation by increasing autophagy/lysosomal flux. The research discussed here may lead to a disease-modifying therapy that tackles disease onset and progression in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases are mostly modeled using genetically modified animals such as mice. However, animal models do not recapitulate all the phenotypes that are specific to human disease. This is mainly due to the genetic, anatomical and physiological difference in the neuromuscular systems of animals and humans. The emergence of direct and indirect human somatic cell reprogramming technologies may overcome this limitation because they enable the use of disease and patient-specific cellular models as enhanced platforms for drug discovery and autologous cell-based therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and urine-derived stem cells (USCs) are increasingly employed to recapitulate the pathophysiology of various human diseases. Recent cell-based modeling approaches utilize highly complex differentiation systems that faithfully mimic human tissue- and organ-level dysfunctions. In this review, we discuss promising cellular models, such as USC- and iPSC-based approaches, that are currently being used to model human neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Perspective on the Role of Dynamic Alternative RNA Splicing in the Development, Specification, and Function of Axon Initial Segment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism for molecular and functional diversification. In neurons, alternative splicing extensively controls various developmental steps as well as the plasticity and remodeling of neuronal activity in the adult brain. The axon initial segment (AIS) is the specialized compartment of proximal axons that initiates action potential (AP). At the AIS, the ion channels and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) required for AP initiation are densely clustered via the scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins. Notably, recent studies have elucidated that multiple AIS proteins are controlled by extensive alternative splicing in developing and adult brains. Here, we argue the potential role of dynamic regulation of alternative splicing in the development, specification, and functions of the AIS. In particular, we propose the novel concept that alternative splicing potentially modulates the structural and functional plasticity at the AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: PTEN Inhibition Protects Against Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage-Induced Brain Injury Through PTEN/E2F1/β-Catenin Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke with highest mortality and morbidity. We have previously demonstrated that dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate (V), (bpV[pic]) inhibits phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. In this study, we examined the effect of bpV[pic] in the rat ICH model in vivo and the hemin-induced injury model in rat cortical cultures. The rat model of ICH was created by injecting autologous blood into the striatum, and bpV[pic] was intraperitoneally injected. The effects of bpV[pic] were evaluated by neurological tests, Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and Nissl staining. We demonstrate that bpV[pic] attenuates ICH-induced brain injury in vivo and hemin-induced neuron injury in vitro. The expression of E2F1 was increased, but β-catenin expression was decreased after ICH, and the altered expressions of E2F1 and β-catenin after ICH were blocked by bpV[pic] treatment. Our results further show that bpV[pic] increases β-catenin expression through downregulating E2F1 in cortical neurons and prevents hemin-induced neuronal damage through E2F1 downregulation and subsequent upregulation of β-catenin. By testing the effect of PTEN-siRNA, PTEN cDNA, or combined use of ERK1/2 inhibitor and bpV[pic] in cultured cortical neurons after hemin-induced injury, we provide evidence suggesting that PTEN inhibition by bpV[pic] confers neuroprotection through E2F1 and β-catenin pathway, but the neuroprotective role of ERK1/2 activation by bpV[pic] cannot be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Importance&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive techniques for retrieving ocular surface cells from babies infected by zika virus (ZIKV) during the gestational period remain to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to describe an optimized impression cytology method for the isolation of viable cells from Zika infected babies with and without Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) in satisfactory amount and quality to enable easy adoption in the field and application in the context of genomic and molecular approaches.&lt;/p&gt;Design, Settings, and Participants&lt;p&gt;Ocular surface samples were obtained with a hydrophilic nitrocellulose membrane (through optimized impression cytology method) from twelve babies referred to the Pediatric Service of the Antonio Pedro Hospital, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After an authorized written informed consent from the parents, samples were collected from both eyes of 12 babies (4 babies with maternal ZIKV exposure during gestation and presence of clinical signs which included ocular abnormalities and microcephaly; 4 babies with maternal ZIKV exposure during gestation but no clinical signs; and 4 unaffected control babies with negative PCR for Zika virus and without clinical signs). Cells were used for microscopy analyses and evaluated for their suitability for downstream molecular applications in transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our optimized impression cytology protocol enabled the capture of a considerable number of viable cells. The microscopic features of the conjunctival epithelial cells were described by both direct analysis of the membrane-attached cells and analysis of cytospinned captured cells using several staining procedures. Epithelial basal, polyhedral and goblet cells were clearly identified in all groups. All cases of ZIKV infected babies showed potential morphological alterations (cell keratinization, pyknosis, karyolysis, anucleation, and vacuolization). Molecular approaches were also performed in parallel. Genomic DNA and RNA were successfully isolated from all samples to enable the establishment of transcriptomic and proteomic studies.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;p&gt;Our method proved to be a suitable, fast, and non-invasive tool to obtain ocular cell preparations from babies with and without Zika infection. The method yielded sufficient cells for detailed morphological and molecular analyses of samples. We discuss perspectives for the application of impression cytology in the context of ZIKV studies in basic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Bimanual Coordination in Music Interventions on Executive Functions in Aging Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Music training programs have been shown to enhance executive functions in aging adults; however, little is known regarding the extent to which different types of bimanual coordination (i.e., fine and gross motor) in music instruction contribute to these outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of bimanual coordination in music interventions on cognitive performance in healthy older adults (60–80 years). Participants (N = 135) completed motor measures and battery of standardized cognitive measures, before and after a 16-week music training program with a 3 h practice requirement. All participants were matched by age, education, and estimate of intelligence to one of three training programs: piano training (fine motor); percussion instruction (gross motor), and music listening instruction (MLI) (no motor control condition). Results of a Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed significant enhancements in bimanual synchronization and visual scanning/working memory abilities for fine and gross motor training groups as compared to MLI. Pairwise comparisons revealed that piano training significantly improved motor synchronization skills as compared to percussion instruction or music listening. Results suggest that active music performance may benefit working memory, the extent of these benefits may depend upon coordination demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Electrical Stimulation in the Human Cochlea: A Computational Study Based on High-Resolution Micro-CT Scans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01312</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01312</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Many detailed features of the cochlear anatomy have not been included in existing 3D cochlear models, including the microstructures inside the modiolar bone, which in turn determines the path of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We captured the intricate modiolar microstructures in a 3D human cochlea model reconstructed from μCT scans. A new algorithm was developed to reconstruct ANFs running through the microstructures within the model. Using the finite element method, we calculated the electrical potential as well as its first and second spatial derivatives along each ANF elicited by the cochlear implant electrodes. Simulation results of electrical potential was validated against intracochlear potential measurements. Comparison was then made with a simplified model without the microstructures within the cochlea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: When the stimulus was delivered from an electrode located deeper in the apex, the extent of the auditory nerve influenced by a higher electric potential grew larger; at the same time, the maximal potential value at the auditory nerve also became larger. The electric potential decayed at a faster rate toward the base of the cochlea than toward the apex. Compared to the cochlear model incorporating the modiolar microstructures, the simplified version resulted in relatively small differences in electric potential. However, in terms of the first and second derivatives of electric potential along the fibers, which are relevant for the initiation of action potentials, the two models exhibited large differences: maxima in both derivatives with the detailed model were larger by a factor of 1.5 (first derivative) and 2 (second derivative) in the exemplary fibers. More importantly, these maxima occurred at different locations, and opposite signs were found for the values of second derivatives between the two models at parts along the fibers. Hence, while one model predicts depolarization and spike initiation at a given location, the other may instead predict a hyperpolarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although a cochlear model with fewer details seems sufficient for analysing the current spread in the cochlear ducts, a detailed-segmented cochlear model is required for the reconstruction of ANF trajectories through the modiolus, as well as the prediction of firing thresholds and spike initiation sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Viability and Contractility of Rat Brain Pericytes in Conditions That Mimic Stroke; an in vitro Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reopening of the cerebral artery after occlusion often results in “no-reflow” that has been attributed to the death and contraction (rigor mortis) of pericytes. Since this hypothesis still needs to be confirmed, we explored the effects of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) on viability and cell death of primary rat pericytes, in the presence or absence of neurovascular unit-derived cytokines. Two morphodynamic parameters, single cell membrane mobility (SCMM) and fractal dimension (D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;), were used to analyze the cell contractions and membrane complexity before and after OGD. We found a marginal reduction in cell viability after 2–6 h OGD; 24 h OGD caused a large reduction in viability and a large increase in the number of apoptotic and dead cells. Application of erythropoietin (EPO), or a combination of EPO and endothelial growth factor (VEGF&lt;sub&gt;A1−165&lt;/sub&gt;) during OGD significantly reduced cell viability; application of Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) during OGD caused a marginal, insignificant increase in cell viability. Simultaneous application of EPO, VEGF&lt;sub&gt;A1−165&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ang1 significantly increased cell viability during 24 h OGD. Twenty minutes and one hour OGD both significantly reduced SCMM compared to pre-OGD values, while no significant difference was seen in SCMM before and after 3 h OGD. There was a significant decrease in membrane complexity (D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) at 20 min during the OGD that disappeared thereafter. In conclusion, OGD transiently affected cell mobility and shape, which was followed by apoptosis in cultured pericytes. Ang1 may have a potentiality for preventing from the OGD-induced apoptosis. Further studies could clarify the relationship between cell contraction and apoptosis during OGD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Failures in Protein Clearance Partly Underlie Late Onset Neurodegenerative Diseases and Link Pathology to Genetic Risk</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As we identify the loci involved in late onset neurodegenerative disease, we are finding that the majority of them are involved in damage response processes. In this short review, I propose that it is partly a failure in these damage response processes which underlie late onset disease and that the resultant pathology is a marker of the type of damage response which has failed: microglial clearance of damaged neuronal membranes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), ubiquitin proteasome clearance in the tauopathies, and lysosomal clearance in Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this review, I outline this relationship. This article is not intended as a comprehensive review of the cell biology of any of these disorders but rather a summary of the evidence that the genetics and pathology of these disorders appear to point, in each case, to the removal of misfolded proteins as a critical process in disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Evaluation of Six Phase Encoding Based Susceptibility Distortion Correction Methods for Diffusion MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00076</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00076</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Susceptibility distortions impact diffusion MRI data analysis and is typically corrected during preprocessing. Correction strategies involve three classes of methods: registration to a structural image, the use of a fieldmap, or the use of images acquired with opposing phase encoding directions. It has been demonstrated that phase encoding based methods outperform the other two classes, but unfortunately, the choice of which phase encoding based method to use is still an open question due to the absence of any systematic comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this paper we quantitatively evaluated six popular phase encoding based methods for correcting susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI data. We employed a framework that allows for the simulation of realistic diffusion MRI data with susceptibility distortions. We evaluated the ability for methods to correct distortions by comparing the corrected data with the ground truth. Four diffusion tensor metrics (FA, MD, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) were calculated from the corrected data and compared with the ground truth. We also validated two popular indirect metrics using both simulated data and real data. The two indirect metrics are the difference between the corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation over the corrected LR, RL, AP, and PA data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that DR-BUDDI and TOPUP offered the most accurate and robust correction compared to the other four methods using both direct and indirect evaluation metrics. EPIC and HySCO performed well in correcting b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; images but produced poor corrections for diffusion weighted volumes, and also they produced large errors for the four diffusion tensor metrics. We also demonstrate that the indirect metric (the difference between corrected LR and AP data) gives a different ordering of correction quality than the direct metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We suggest researchers to use DR-BUDDI or TOPUP for susceptibility distortion correction. The two indirect metrics (the difference between corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation) should be interpreted together as a measure of distortion correction quality. The performance ranking of the various tools inferred from direct and indirect metrics differs slightly. However, across all tools, the results of direct and indirect metrics are highly correlated indicating that the analysis of indirect metrics may provide a good proxy of the performance of a correction tool if assessment using direct metrics is not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Resting State BOLD Variability Is Linked to White Matter Vascular Burden in Healthy Aging but Not in Older Adults With Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00429</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00429</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. A lack of curative treatments and a rapidly aging global population have amplified the need for early biomarkers of the disease process. Recent advances suggest that subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be one of the earliest symptomatic markers of the AD cascade. Previous studies have identified changes in variability in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in patients with AD, with a possible association between BOLD variability and cerebrovascular factors in the aging brain. The objective of the current study was to determine whether changes in BOLD variability can be identified in individuals with SCD, and whether this signal may be associated with markers of cerebrovascular integrity in SCD and older adults without memory complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Data were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database from 19 participants with SCD and 19 similarly-aged controls. For each participant, a map of BOLD signal variability (SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt;) was computed as the standard deviation of the BOLD time-series at each voxel. Group comparisons were performed to examine differences in resting-state SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in SCD vs. healthy controls. Relationships were then examined between participant SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; maps and neuroimaging markers of white matter vascular infarcts in each group separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in whole-brain SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in individuals with SCD and controls. In the healthy aging group, higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden was associated with greater SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in right temporal regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and lower scores on a measure of global executive functioning. These associations were not identified in individuals with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The current study underscores previous evidence for a relationship between SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and white matter vascular infarcts in the healthy aging brain. The findings also provide evidence for a dissociable relationship between healthy aging and SCD, such that in healthy controls, increased WMH is associated with declines in executive function that is not observed in older adults who present with memory complaints. Further multimodal work is needed to better understand the contributions of vascular pathology to the BOLD signal, and its potential relationship with pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Topographic Somatosensory Imagery for Real-Time fMRI Brain-Computer Interfacing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00427</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising non-invasive method for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs translate brain activity into signals that allow communication with the outside world. Visual and motor imagery are often used as information-encoding strategies, but can be challenging if not grounded in recent experience in these modalities, e.g., in patients with locked-in-syndrome (LIS). In contrast, somatosensory imagery might constitute a more suitable information-encoding strategy as the somatosensory function is often very robust. Somatosensory imagery has been shown to activate the somatotopic cortex, but it has been unclear so far whether it can be reliably detected on a single-trial level and successfully classified according to specific somatosensory imagery content. Using ultra-high field 7-T fMRI, we show reliable and high-accuracy single-trial decoding of left-foot (LF) vs. right-hand (RH) somatosensory imagery. Correspondingly, higher decoding accuracies were associated with greater spatial separation of hand and foot decoding-weight patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Exploiting these novel neuroscientific insights, we developed—and provide a proof of concept for—basic BCI communication by showing that binary (yes/no) answers encoded by somatosensory imagery can be decoded with high accuracy in simulated real-time (in 7 subjects) as well as in real-time (1 subject). This study demonstrates that body part-specific somatosensory imagery differentially activates somatosensory cortex in a topographically specific manner; evidence which was surprisingly still lacking in the literature. It also offers proof of concept for a novel somatosensory imagery-based fMRI-BCI control strategy, with particularly high potential for visually and motor-impaired patients. The strategy could also be transferred to lower MRI field strengths and to mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Finally, given that communication BCIs provide the BCI user with a form of feedback based on their brain signals and can thus be considered as a specific form of neurofeedback, and that repeated use of a BCI has been shown to enhance underlying representations, we expect that the current BCI could also offer an interesting new approach for somatosensory rehabilitation training in the context of stroke and phantom limb pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Distinct Neural Processes for Memorizing Form and Meaning Within Sentences</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to memorize sentences we use both processes of language comprehension during encoding and processes of language production during maintenance. While the former processes are easily testable via controlled presentation of the input, the latter are more difficult to assess directly as language production is typically initiated and controlled internally. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study we track subvocal rehearsal of sentences, with the goal of studying the concomitant planning processes with the help of a silent cued-production task. Native German participants read different types of sentences word-by-word, then were prompted by a visual cue to silently repeat each individual word, in a rehearsal phase. In order to assess both local and global effects of sentence planning, we presented correct sentences, syntactically or semantically violated sentences, or random word order sequences. Semantic violations during reading elicited an N400 effect at the noun violating the selectional restrictions of the preceding verb. Syntactic violations, induced by a gender incongruency between determiner and noun, led to a P600 effect at the same position. Different ERP patterns occurred during the silent production phase. Here, semantically violated sentences elicited an early fronto-central negativity at the verb, while syntactically violated sentences elicited a late right-frontal positivity at the determiner. Random word order was accompanied by long-lasting slow waves during the production phase. The findings are consistent with models of hierarchical sentence planning and further indicate that the ongoing working memory processes are qualitatively distinct from comprehension mechanisms and neurophysiologically specific for syntactic and lexical-semantic level planning. In conclusion, active working memory maintenance of sentences is likely to comprise specific stages of sentence production that are indicated by ERP correlates of syntactic and semantic planning at the phrasal and clausal level respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurobiological systems rely on hierarchical and modular architectures to carry out intricate computations using minimal resources. A prerequisite for such systems to operate adequately is the capability to reliably and efficiently transfer information across multiple modules. Here, we study the features enabling a robust transfer of stimulus representations in modular networks of spiking neurons, tuned to operate in a balanced regime. To capitalize on the complex, transient dynamics that such networks exhibit during active processing, we apply reservoir computing principles and probe the systems' computational efficacy with specific tasks. Focusing on the comparison of random feed-forward connectivity and biologically inspired topographic maps, we find that, in a sequential set-up, structured projections between the modules are strictly necessary for information to propagate accurately to deeper modules. Such mappings not only improve computational performance and efficiency, they also reduce response variability, increase robustness against interference effects, and boost memory capacity. We further investigate how information from two separate input streams is integrated and demonstrate that it is more advantageous to perform non-linear computations on the input locally, within a given module, and subsequently transfer the result downstream, rather than transferring intermediate information and performing the computation downstream. Depending on how information is integrated early on in the system, the networks achieve similar task-performance using different strategies, indicating that the dimensionality of the neural responses does not necessarily correlate with nonlinear integration, as predicted by previous studies. These findings highlight a key role of topographic maps in supporting fast, robust, and accurate neural communication over longer distances. Given the prevalence of such structural feature, particularly in the sensory systems, elucidating their functional purpose remains an important challenge toward which this work provides relevant, new insights. At the same time, these results shed new light on important requirements for designing functional hierarchical spiking networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is best known for its robust dopaminergic projections to forebrain regions and their critical role in regulating reward, motivation, cognition, and aversion. However, the VTA is not only made of dopamine (DA) cells, as approximately 30% of cells in the VTA are GABA neurons. These neurons play a dual role, as VTA GABA neurons provide both local inhibition of VTA DA neurons and long-range inhibition of several distal brain regions. VTA GABA neurons have increasingly been recognized as potent mediators of reward and aversion in their own right, as well as potential targets for the treatment of addiction, depression, and other stress-linked disorders. In this review article, we dissect the circuit architecture, physiology, and behavioral roles of VTA GABA neurons and suggest critical gaps to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Increased Inflammation and Unchanged Density of Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) in the Postmortem Frontal Cortex of Alzheimer’s Disease Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sections from the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 46) of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and non-demented subjects were examined for the prevalence of hallmark AD pathology, including amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, neuroinflammation and synaptic loss (n = 7 subjects/group). Dense-core deposits of Aβ were present in all AD patients (7/7) and some non-demented subjects (3/7), as evidenced by 6E10 immunohistochemistry. Levels of Aβ immunoreactivity were higher in AD vs. non-AD cases. For pTau, AT8-positive neurofibrillary tangles and threads were exclusively observed in AD patient tissue. Levels of [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]PK11195 binding to the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of inflammatory processes, were elevated in the gray matter of AD patients compared to non-demented subjects. Levels of [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]UCB-J binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a marker of synaptic density, were not different between groups. In AD patients, pTau immunoreactivity was positively correlated with [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]PK11195, and negatively correlated with [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]UCB-J binding levels. No correlation was observed between Aβ immunoreactivity and markers of neuroinflammation or synaptic density. These data demonstrate a close interplay between tau pathology, inflammation and SV2A density in AD, and provide useful information on the ability of neuroimaging biomarkers to diagnose AD dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: miRNA-Dependent Control of Homeostatic Plasticity in Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity is a form of plasticity in which neurons compensate for changes in neuronal activity through the control of key physiological parameters such as the number and the strength of their synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability. Recent studies revealed that miRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs repressing mRNA translation, participate in this process by controlling the translation of multiple effectors such as glutamate transporters, receptors, signaling molecules and voltage-gated ion channels. In this review, we present and discuss the role of miRNAs in both cell-wide and compartmentalized forms of homeostatic plasticity as well as their implication in pathological processes associated with homeostatic failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Remembering Mechanosensitivity of NMDA Receptors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An increase in post-synaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance through activation of the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and concomitant structural changes are essential for the initiation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation. Memories can be initiated by coincident events, as occurs in classical conditioning, where the NMDAR can act as a molecular coincidence detector. Binding of glutamate and glycine, together with depolarization of the postsynaptic cell membrane to remove the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore block, results in NMDAR opening for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance. Accumulating evidence has implicated both force-from-lipids and protein tethering mechanisms for mechanosensory transduction in NMDAR, which has been demonstrated by both, membrane stretch and application of amphipathic molecules such as arachidonic acid (AA). The contribution of mechanosensitivity to memory formation and consolidation may be to increase activity of the NMDAR leading to facilitated memory formation. In this review we look back at the progress made toward understanding the physiological and pathological role of NMDA receptor channels in mechanobiology of the nervous system and consider these findings in like of their potential functional implications for memory formation. We examine recent studies identifying mechanisms of both NMDAR and other mechanosensitive channels and discuss functional implications including gain control of NMDA opening probability. Mechanobiology is a rapidly growing area of biology with many important implications for understanding form, function and pathology in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Predictive Value of Routine Peripheral Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00332</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Biomarker screening is of major significance for the early diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Routine peripheral blood parameters are easy to collect and detect, making them ideal potential biomarkers. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the parameters from routine blood as potential biomarkers for AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 56 AD patients, 57 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 59 healthy elderly controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic values of routine blood biomarkers in patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were significant differences in eight parameters between the groups. Logistic regression revealed that the neutrophil% (odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.75, p = 0.031) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; OR 6.27, 95% CI 3.98–9.82, p = 0.003) differentiated AD patients and controls (areas under the curve [AUCs], 0.728 and 0.721) and that the NLR (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.07–3.47, p = 0.028) and mean platelet volume (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04–2.70, p = 0.036) differentiated MCI patients and controls (AUCs, 0.60 and 0.638). There were no effective diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish AD from MCI.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Some routine blood biomarkers may correlate with cognitive impairment. Analysis of these biomarkers, such as the NLR, may be useful for the identification of patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, our unprecedented numerical skills are deeply rooted in our neuronal heritage as primates and vertebrates. In this article, I argue that numerical competence in humans is the result of three neural constraints. First, I propose that the neuronal mechanisms of quantity estimation are part of our evolutionary heritage and can be witnessed across primate and vertebrate phylogeny. Second, I suggest that a basic understanding of number, what numerical quantity means, is innately wired into the brain and gives rise to an intuitive number sense, or number instinct. Third and finally, I argue that symbolic counting and arithmetic in humans is rooted in an evolutionarily and ontogenetically primeval neural system for non-symbolic number representations. These three neural constraints jointly determine the basic processing of number concepts in the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Speech and language are the most widely appreciated behaviors learned in this way. Vocal imitation in songbirds is perhaps the best studied socially transmitted behavior, and research over the past few years has begun to crack the circuit mechanisms for how songbirds learn from vocal models. Studies in zebra finches are revealing an unexpected and essential role for premotor cortical circuits in forming the behavioral-goal memories used to guide song imitation, challenging the view that song memories used for imitation are stored in auditory circuits. Here, we provide a summary of this recent progress focusing on the &lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; of tutor song memory, and propose a circuit hypothesis for song learning based on these recent findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While brain default mode network (DMN) activation in human subjects has been associated with mind wandering, meditation practice has been found to suppress it and to increase psychological well-being. In addition to DMN activity reduction, experienced meditators (EMs) during meditation practice show an increased connectivity between the DMN and the central executive network (CEN). However, the gradual change between DMN and CEN configuration from pre-meditation, during meditation, and post-meditation is unknown. Here, we investigated the change in DMN and CEN configuration by means of brain activity and functional connectivity (FC) analyses in EMs across three back-to-back functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans: pre-meditation baseline (trait), meditation (state), and post-meditation (state-to-trait). Pre-meditation baseline group comparison was also performed between EMs and healthy controls (HCs). Meditation trait was characterized by a significant reduction in activity and FC within DMN and increased anticorrelations between DMN and CEN. Conversely, meditation state and meditation state-to-trait periods showed increased activity and FC within the DMN and between DMN and CEN. However, the latter anticorrelations were only present in EMs with limited practice. The interactions between networks during these states by means of positive diametric activity (PDA) of the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) defined as  revealed no trait differences but significant increases during meditation state that persisted in meditation state-to-trait. The gradual reconfiguration in DMN and CEN suggest a neural mechanism by which the CEN negatively regulates the DMN and is probably responsible for the long-term trait changes seen in meditators and reported psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differential Nicotinic Modulation of Glutamatergic and GABAergic VTA Microcircuits</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons receive glutamatergic and/or GABAergic input from other local neurons within the VTA. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity is capable of modulating such intra-VTA transmission, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we isolated monosynaptic glutamate or GABA transmission from mouse medial VTA (mVTA) to lateral VTA (latVTA) using pharmacology and optogenetics, and we studied the ability of nicotine to modulate these modes of transmission. The action of nicotine on mVTA to latVTA glutamate transmission was bidirectional; nicotine enhanced glutamate release in half of the recorded latVTA cells and inhibited release in the other half. Nicotine-mediated reduction in glutamate release was reversed by blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. This, coupled with expression data demonstrating coexpression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) and glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) in mVTA neurons, suggests that nicotine is able to stimulate GABA corelease from mVTA VGluT2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nicotine had an altogether different effect on mVTA to latVTA GABA release from Gad2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells; nicotine suppressed GABA release from mVTA Gad2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals in nearly all cells tested. Together, these data uncover a complex system of local circuitry in the VTA that is modulated by nAChR activity. These actions of nicotine, which occurred at concentrations of nicotine found in the artificial CSF of cigarette smokers, may play a role in the adaptive response of the reward system to repeated nicotine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While multiple studies have been conducted of gene expression in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), their findings have not reached a clear consensus and have not accounted for the potentially confounding effects of changes in cellular composition. To help address this gap, we conducted a re-analysis based meta-analysis (mega-analysis) of ten independent studies of hippocampal gene expression in mouse models of AD. We used estimates of cellular composition as covariates in statistical models aimed to identify genes differentially expressed (DE) at either early or late stages of progression. Our analysis revealed changes in gene expression at early phases shared across studies, including dysregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and the complement system. Expression changes at later stages were dominated by cellular compositional effects. Thus, despite the considerable heterogeneity of the mouse models, we identified common patterns that may contribute to our understanding of AD etiology. Our work also highlights the importance of controlling for cellular composition effects in genomics studies of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity With Axonal Delay Tunes Networks of Izhikevich Neurons to the Edge of Synchronization Transition With Scale-Free Avalanches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Critical brain hypothesis has been intensively studied both in experimental and theoretical neuroscience over the past two decades. However, some important questions still remain: (i) What is the critical point the brain operates at? (ii) What is the regulatory mechanism that brings about and maintains such a critical state? (iii) The critical state is characterized by scale-invariant behavior which is seemingly at odds with definitive brain oscillations? In this work we consider a biologically motivated model of Izhikevich neuronal network with chemical synapses interacting via spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as well as axonal time delay. Under generic and physiologically relevant conditions we show that the system is organized and maintained around a synchronization transition point as opposed to an activity transition point associated with an absorbing state phase transition. However, such a state exhibits experimentally relevant signs of critical dynamics including scale-free avalanches with finite-size scaling as well as critical branching ratios. While the system displays stochastic oscillations with highly correlated fluctuations, it also displays dominant frequency modes seen as sharp peaks in the power spectrum. The role of STDP as well as time delay is crucial in achieving and maintaining such critical dynamics, while the role of inhibition is not as crucial. In this way we provide possible answers to all three questions posed above. We also show that one can achieve supercritical or subcritical dynamics if one changes the average time delay associated with axonal conduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily Vanilloid 4 and 3 in the Inner Ear Protect Hearing in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00296</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transient receptor potential cation channel, vanilloid type (TRPV) 3, is a member of the TRPV subfamily that is expressed predominantly in the skin, hair follicles, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also distributed in the organ of Corti of the inner ear and colocalizes with TRPV1 or TRPV4, but its role in auditory function is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that TRPV3 is expressed in inner hair cells (HCs) but mainly in cochlear outer HCs in mice, with expression limited to the cytoplasm and not detected in stereocilia. We compared the number of HCs as well as distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between TRPV3 knockout (V3KO) and wild-type (V3WT) mice and found that although most mutants (72.3%) had normal hearing, a significant proportion (27.7%) showed impaired hearing associated with loss of cochlear HCs. Compensatory upregulation of TRPV4 in HCs prevented HC damage and kanamycin-induced hearing loss and preserved normal auditory function in most of these mice. Thus, TRPV4 and TRPV3 in cochlear HCs protect hearing in mice; moreover, the results suggest some functional redundancy in the functions of TRPV family members. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular basis of auditory function in mammals that can be applied to the development of strategies to mitigate hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Better to Eat You With: Bite Force in the Naked Mole-Rat (Heterocephalus glaber) Is Stronger Than Predicted Based on Body Size</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00070</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00070</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are subterranean rodents that utilize their incisors for feeding, chisel-tooth digging of complex tunnel systems, social interactions, and defense in their eusocial colony structure. Previous studies have shown that naked mole-rats have morphological and anatomical adaptations that predict strong bite forces, namely, skulls that are relatively tall and wide, in addition to impressive masticatory musculature. However, no studies to date have directly measured bite force in this species or analyzed the relationship between bite force and social caste. In the current study, we assessed adult naked mole-rat maximum bite force in relation to body mass, in addition to considering each animal’s position within the eusocial hierarchy (i.e., dominant versus subordinate). Each animal was permitted to freely interact with a piezo-resistive bite force sensor. Our results showed that bite force was correlated with body mass in subordinate but not in dominant naked mole-rats, and that subordinate animals exhibited a shorter latency in producing their first bite. Maximum bite force was significantly influenced by caste. In comparing bite force with available data from previous studies across 82 additional mammalian species, subordinate naked mole-rats exhibited a bite force that was 65% higher than predicted for their body size, comparable to Tasmanian devils and exceeding bite force values for all of the carnivorans included for comparison. These results supported the hypothesis that the naked mole-rat’s bite force would exceed predictions based on body size due to the behavioral importance and specialization of the naked mole-rat incisors. This study provides insight into the differences in bite force across species, and the significant role that social and ecological factors might play in the evolutionary relationship between bite force performance and underlying anatomical structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A MEG Study of Acute Arbaclofen (STX-209) Administration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several electrophysiological parameters, including the auditory evoked response component M50/M100 latencies and the phase synchrony of transient and steady-state gamma-band oscillations have been implicated as atypical (to various extents) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, some hypotheses suggest that an underlying neurobiological mechanism for these observations might be atypical local circuit function indexed by atypical levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, escalating-dose, acute investigation conducted in 25 14–18 year-old adolescents with ASD. The study assessed the sensitivity of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and MEGAPRESS “GABA” magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor dose-dependent acute effects, as well as seeking to define properties of the pre-drug “baseline” electrophysiological and GABA signatures that might predict responsiveness to the GABA-B agonist, arbaclofen (STX-209). Overall, GABA levels and gamma-band oscillatory activity showed no acute changes at either low (15 mg) or high (30 mg) dose. Evoked M50 response latency measures tended to shorten (normalize), but there was heterogeneity across the group in M50 latency response, with only a subset of participants (n = 6) showing significant M50 latency shortening, and only at the 15 mg dose. Findings thus suggest that MEG M50 latency measures show acute effects of arbaclofen administration in select individuals, perhaps reflecting effective target engagement. Whether these subjects have a greater trend towards clinical benefit remains to be established. Finally, findings also provide preliminary support for the use of objective electrophysiological measures upon which to base inclusion for optimal enrichment of populations to be included in full-scale clinical trials of arbaclofen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessels feed and protect the brain parenchyma thanks to the unique features of the blood–brain barrier. Cerebrovascular dysfunction is therefore seen as a detrimental factor for the initiation of several central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as stroke, cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), and Alzheimer’s disease. The main working hypothesis linking cerebrovascular dysfunction to brain disorders includes the contribution of neuroinflammation. While our knowledge on microglia cells – the brain-resident immune cells – has been increasing in the last decades, the specific populations of microglia and macrophages surrounding brain vessels, vessel-associated microglia (VAM), and perivascular macrophages (PVMs), respectively, have been overlooked. This review aims to summarize the knowledge gathered on VAM and PVMs, to discuss existing knowledge gaps of importance for later studies and to summarize evidences for their contribution to cerebrovascular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Pilot Study Investigating Changes in Capillary Hemodynamics and Its Modulation by Exercise in the APP-PS1 Alzheimer Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in neurovascular coupling that results in a mismatch between cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity has been suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Meanwhile, physical exercise is a powerful approach for maintaining cognitive health and could play a preventive role against the progression of AD. Given the fundamental role of capillaries in oxygen transport to tissue, our pilot study aimed to characterize changes in capillary hemodynamics with AD and AD supplemented by exercise. Exploiting two-photon microscopy, intrinsic signal optical imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging, we found hemodynamic alterations and lower vascular density with AD that were reversed by exercise. We further observed that capillary properties were branch order-dependent and that stimulation-evoked changes were attenuated with AD but increased by exercise. Our study provides novel indications into cerebral microcirculatory disturbances with AD and the modulating role of voluntary exercise on these alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Ten Sessions of High Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (HF-rTMS) Add-on Treatment on Impulsivity in Alcohol Use Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01257</guid>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by increased impulsivity, which is multifactorial and can be assessed by tests like the delay discounting, Go-Nogo, and stop signal task (SST). Impulsivity has been related to poor treatment outcomes in substance use disorders, including AUD. In order to decrease impulsivity or improve inhibitory control, high frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has gained interest. Studies applying HF-rTMS over the DLPFC of individuals suffering from AUD assessing its effects on impulsivity measures are scarce, and results are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The current study (registered in Netherlands Trial Register with trial number 5291: https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5151) applied 10 sessions of HF-rTMS [sixty 10 Hz trains of 5 s at 110% motor threshold (MT)] over the right DLPFC of 80 alcohol dependent patients in clinical treatment on 10 consecutive workdays. At baseline, halfway and after the HF-rTMS treatment, the delay discounting, Go-NoGo, and SST were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Ten sessions of HF-rTMS over the right DLPFC versus sham HF-rTMS did not affect performance on the delay discounting, Go-NoGo, and SSTs. A significant effect of age was found for the Go-NoGo task, with higher age associated with better performance. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between difference scores of task performance and baseline impulsivity or severity of AUD.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Results of this study, in combination with other studies using HF-rTMS studies in alcohol and substance use disorder, indicate mixed and inconclusive findings of HF-rTMS on impulsivity. Future studies within patient groups hospitalized at the same department are recommended to consider using a sham coil that mimics the sensations on the scalp of active HF-rTMS and to measure motivation across test sessions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Connectivity Between Motor and Mid-Frontal Areas During Vicarious Reward Revealed via EEG Time-Frequency Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vicarious reward is a phenomenon in which an individual feels as if he/she has received a reward as the result of watching someone else receive a reward. In this study, we used electroencephalography to investigate brain activity while participants watched a preferred player win a competitive game (Rock-Paper-Scissors game). In the experimental task, movie clips showed right hand of the two players and played Rock-Paper-Scissors game. We asked participants to explicitly support or “cheer” for a specific player, and then examined brain activity associated with vicarious reward. For the observed hand movement, previous findings showed that the event-related desynchronization of mu band (8–14 Hz) appeared at the contra-lateral central electrode to the observed hand (If someone sees the right-hand movement, the left central electrode shows the event-related desynchronization of mu-band). During observation of the player, we detected event-related desynchronization of mu band activity in the contra-lateral central electrode as well as mid-frontal beta band (15–22 Hz) activation when the preferred player won. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a strong phase synchronization between the contra-lateral central electrode and mid-frontal electrode in the mu band when participants received the vicarious reward. Cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed functional integration between the mu and beta bands at mid-frontal electrode. These results indicate the interaction of mu band observed at contra-lateral electrode and beta band observed at mid-frontal electrode coupling, suggesting a link between the mirror neuron system and the reward system during vicarious reward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: On the Hierarchical Organization of Oscillatory Assemblies: Layered Superimposition and a Global Bioelectric Framework</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00426</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bioelectric oscillations occur throughout the nervous system of nearly all animals, revealed to play an important role in various aspects of cognitive activity such as information processing and feature binding. Modern research into this dynamic and intrinsic bioelectric activity of neural cells continues to raise questions regarding their role in consciousness and cognition. In this theoretical article, we assert a novel interpretation of the hierarchical nature of “brain waves” by identifying that the superposition of multiple oscillations varying in frequency corresponds to the superimposing of the contents of consciousness and cognition. In order to describe this isomorphism, we present a layered model of the global functional oscillations of various frequencies which act as a part of a unified metastable continuum described by the Operational Architectonics theory and suggested to be responsible for the emergence of the phenomenal mind. We detail the purposes, functions, and origins of each layer while proposing our main theory that the superimposition of these oscillatory layers mirrors the superimposition of the components of the integrated phenomenal experience as well as of cognition. In contrast to the traditional view that localizations of high and low-frequency activity are spatially distinct, many authors have suggested a hierarchical nature to oscillations. Our theoretical interpretation is founded in four layers which correlate not only in frequency but in evolutionary development. As other authors have done, we explore how these layers correlate to the phenomenology of human experience. Special importance is placed on the most basal layer of slow oscillations in coordinating and grouping all of the other layers. By detailing the isomorphism between the phenomenal and physiologic aspects of how lower frequency layers provide a foundation for higher frequency layers to be organized upon, we provide a further means to elucidate physiological and cognitive mechanisms of mind and for the well-researched outcomes of certain voluntary breathing patterns and meditative practices which modulate the mind and have therapeutic effects for psychiatric and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: High Concussion Rate in Student Community Rugby Union Players During the 2018 Season: Implications for Future Research Directions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collision sports, such as Rugby Union (“Rugby”) have a particularly high risk of injury. Of all injuries common to collision sports, concussions have received the most attention due to the potentially negative cognitive effects in the short- and long-term. Despite non-professional Rugby players comprising the majority of the world’s playing population, there is relatively little research in this population. Stellenbosch Rugby Football Club (“Maties”), the official rugby club of Stellenbosch University, represents one of the world’s largest non-professional Rugby clubs, making this an ideal cohort for community-level injury surveillance. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and events associated with concussion in this cohort. Baseline demographics were obtained on the 807 male student Rugby non-professional players who registered for the 10-week long 2018 season, which comprised 101 matches and 2,915 of exposure hours. All match-related injuries were captured by the medical staff of Stellenbosch Campus Health Service on an electronic form developed from the consensus statement for injury recording in Rugby. The mean age, height and weight of this cohort were 20 ± 2 years, 182 ± 7 cm and 88 ± 14 kg, respectively. Overall, there were 89 time-loss injuries, which equated to an injury rate of 30.6 per 1,000 match hours [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 24.2–36.9], or about one injury per match. The most common injury diagnosis was “concussion” (n = 27 out of 90 injuries, 30%), at a rate of 9.3 per 1,000 match hours (95% CIs: 5.8–12.8). The three most common mechanisms of concussion in the present study were performing a tackle (33%), accidental collision (30%) and being tackled (11%). Concussion was the most common injury in this population, at a rate that was six times higher than the most comparable study from the UK, which had far more exposure time over six seasons and wider range of player ability, from recreational to semi-professional. This might be explained by the training and vigilance of the club’s first aiders observing all matches for concussion. Future studies should try to explain this high rate and subsequently reduce these concussions. The addition of video surveillance data would assist in identifying the etiology of these concussions injuries in order to develop specific targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Bidirectional Synaptic Plasticity Is Driven by Sex Neurosteroids Targeting Estrogen and Androgen Receptors in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00534</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00534</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroactive estrogenic and androgenic steroids influence synaptic transmission, finely modulating synaptic plasticity in several brain regions including the hippocampus. While estrogens facilitate long-term potentiation (LTP), androgens are involved in the induction of long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation (DP) of synaptic transmission. To examine sex neurosteroid-dependent LTP and LTD in single cells, patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of male rats and selective antagonists for estrogen receptors (ERs) and androgen (AR) receptors were used. LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) depended on activation of ERs since it was prevented by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 in most of the neurons. Application of the selective antagonists for ERα (MPP) or ERβ (PHTPP) caused a reduction of the LTP amplitude, while these antagonists in combination, prevented LTP completely. LTP was never affected by blocking AR with the specific antagonist flutamide. Conversely, LTD and DP, elicited by low-frequency stimulation (LFS), were impeded by flutamide, but not by ICI 182,780, in most neurons. In few cells, LTD was even reverted to LTP by flutamide. Moreover, the combined application of both ER and AR antagonists completely prevented both LTP and LTD/DP in the same neuron. The current study demonstrates that the activation of ERs is necessary for inducing LTP in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas the activation of ARs is required for LTD and DP. Moreover, both estrogen- and androgen-dependent LTP and LTD can be expressed in the same pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the activation of sex neurosteroids signaling pathways is responsible for bidirectional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Aerobic Exercise Training Improves Cerebral Blood Flow and Executive Function: A Randomized, Controlled Cross-Over Trial in Sedentary Older Men</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Physical activity may attenuate age-related cognitive decline by improving cerebrovascular function. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate effects of aerobic exercise training on cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is a sensitive physiological marker of cerebrovascular function, in sedentary older men.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventeen apparently healthy men, aged 60–70 years and with a BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, were included in a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. Study participants were randomly allocated to a fully-supervised, progressive, aerobic exercise training or no-exercise control period for 8 weeks, separated by a 12-week wash-out period. Measurements at the end of each period included aerobic fitness evaluated using peak oxygen consumption during incremental exercise (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;), CBF measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging, and post-load glucose responses determined using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Furthermore, cognitive performance was assessed in the domains of executive function, memory, and psychomotor speed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased following aerobic exercise training compared to no-exercise control by 262 ± 236 mL (P &amp;lt; 0.001). CBF was increased by 27% bilaterally in the frontal lobe, particularly the subcallosal and anterior cingulate gyrus (cluster volume: 1008 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; P &amp;lt; 0.05), while CBF was reduced by 19% in the right medial temporal lobe, mainly temporal fusiform gyrus (cluster volume: 408 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; P &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean post-load glucose concentrations determined using an OGTT decreased by 0.33 ± 0.63 mmol/L (P = 0.049). Furthermore, executive function improved as the latency of response was reduced by 5% (P = 0.034), but no changes were observed in memory or psychomotor speed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise training improves regional CBF in sedentary older men. These changes in CBF may underlie exercise-induced beneficial effects on executive function, which could be partly mediated by improvements in glucose metabolism. This clinical trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03272061.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The MAPT H1 Haplotype Is a Risk Factor for Alzheimer’s Disease in APOE ε4 Non-carriers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00327</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An ancestral inversion of 900 kb on chromosome 17q21, which includes the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, defines two haplotype clades in Caucasians (H1 and H2). The H1 haplotype has been linked inconsistently with AD. In a previous study, we showed that an SNP tagging this haplotype (rs1800547) was associated with AD risk in a large population from the Dementia Genetics Spanish Consortium (DEGESCO) including 4435 cases and 6147 controls. The association was mainly driven by individuals that were non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele. Our aim was to replicate our previous findings in an independent sample of 4124 AD cases and 3290 controls from Spain (GR@ACE project) and to analyze the effect of the H1 sub-haplotype structure on the risk of AD. The H1 haplotype was associated with AD risk (OR = 1.12; p = 0.0025). Stratification analysis showed that this association was mainly driven by the APOE ε4 non-carriers (OR = 1.15; p = 0.0022). Pooled analysis of both Spanish datasets (n = 17,996) showed that the highest AD risk related to the MAPT H1/H2 haplotype was in those individuals that were the oldest [third tertile (&amp;gt;77 years)] and did not carry APOE ε4 allele (p = 0.001). We did not find a significant association between H1 sub-haplotypes and AD. H1c was nominally associated but lost statistical significance after adjusting by population sub-structure. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic variants linked to the MAPT H1/H2 are tracking a genuine risk allele for AD. The fact that this association is stronger in APOE ε4 non-carriers partially explains previous controversial results and might be related to a slower alternative causal pathway less dependent on brain amyloid load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Pain is a hallmark of inflammation and can be either protective or detrimental during acute or chronic phase. Macrophages play a chief role in the pathogenesis of pain and have bilateral communications with nociceptors, the specialized primary sensory neurons that sense pain. Macrophages ‘talk to’ nociceptors by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) that induce pain via direct activation of nociceptors. Macrophages also ‘listen to’ nociceptors, by which nociceptors secrete neuropeptides and chemokines which act on macrophages. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in nociceptors releases CCL2, activating macrophages and potentiating pathological pain. Emerging evidence also points to a pro-resolution role of macrophages in inflammation and pain. Macrophage GPR37 is activated by neuroprotectin D1, a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) and resolves inflammatory pain via phagocytosis and production of IL-10 that inhibits nociceptors. Macrophage-nociceptor interactions are also mediated by microRNAs and microRNA-containing exosomes in chronic pain. Notably, extracellular microRNAs (e.g. let-7b and miR-711) can directly bind and activate nociceptors. Targeting macrophage-nociceptor interactions will help to control inflammation and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The contribution of these factors in shaping the gut microbiota and the subsequent effects on the prevention and development of stroke has been under intense investigation. Furthermore, several reports have uncovered the impact of stroke on intestinal dysfunction and gut dysbiosis, highlighting the delicate interplay between the brain, gut and microbiome following this acute brain injury. Despite our growing appreciation of the gut microbiota in shaping brain health, the immune system, host metabolism and disease progression, its therapeutic capability in stroke is yet to be fully exploited. This review will explore the microbiota-gut-brain axis in stroke, and examine the potential role of the gut microbiota in the onset, progression and recovery phase of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In contrast to most vertebrates, insects usually must cope with low resolution retinal images and the inability to infer spatial features using accommodation or stereovision. However, during locomotion, the retinal input is dominated by characteristic panoramic image shifts, termed optic flow, that depend on self-motion parameters and environmental features. Therefore, optic flow provides a rich source of information guiding locomotion speed as well as the position and orientation of animals over time relative to their surroundings. Here, focusing on flight behavior, we describe the strategies and putative underlying neuronal mechanisms by which insects control their course through processing of visual motion cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: ASC1 is a cell cycle regulator associated with severe and mild forms of myopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25660?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the ASC‐1 complex has been identified as a mechanistic link between ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and three mutations of the ASC‐1 gene &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; have been associated with SMA or congenital myopathy. Our goal was to define ASC‐1 neuromuscular function and the phenotypical spectrum associated with &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical, molecular, histological and MRI studies in 5 families with 7 novel &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; mutations. FACS and Western blot in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles and in &lt;i&gt;Trip4&lt;/i&gt; knocked‐down C2C12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All mutations caused ASC‐1 protein depletion. The clinical phenotype was purely myopathic, ranging from lethal neonatal to mild ambulatory adult patients. It included early‐onset axial and proximal weakness, scoliosis, rigid spine, dysmorphic facies, cutaneous involvement, respiratory failure and, in the older cases, dilated cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed multiminicores, nemaline rods, cytoplasmic bodies, caps, central nuclei, rimmed fibers and/or mild endomysial fibrosis. ASC‐1 depletion in C2C12 and in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles caused accelerated proliferation, altered expression of cell cycle proteins and/or shortening of the G0/G1 cell cycle phase leading to cell size reduction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results expand the phenotypical and molecular spectrum of &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt;‐associated disease to include mild adult forms with or without cardiomyopathy, associate ASC‐1 depletion with primary pure muscle involvement and establish &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; as a causative gene for several congenital muscle diseases including nemaline, core, centronuclear or cytoplasmic‐body myopathies. They also identify ASC‐1 as a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in cell proliferation, and underline transcriptional co‐regulation defects as a novel pathophysiological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cooperative Phase Adaptation and Amplitude Amplification of Neuronal Activity in the Vagal Complex: An Interplay Between Microcircuits and Macrocircuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Clusters of neurons can communicate with others through the cross-frequency coupling mechanism of oscillatory synchrony. We addressed the hypothesis that neuronal networks at various levels from micro- to macrocircuits implement this communication strategy. An abundance of local recurrent axons of vagal complex (VC) cells establish dense local microcircuits and seem to generate high-frequency noise-causing stochastic resonance (reverberation) and coherence resonance, even in in vitro slice preparations. These phenomena were observed in vitro as the generation of episodes of higher-frequency noise after an external stimulation and as stimulus-induced or spontaneous high-amplitude signals (postsynaptic activities). The in vitro microcircuit networks rarely sustained the stochastic resonance and coherence resonance cooperatively; however, in vivo networks involving additional intrabulbar mesocircuits and large-scale macrocircuits were able to sustain them cooperatively. This gave rise to large-scale oscillatory synchrony leading to robust power and coherence of signals with high amplitudes, reaching several millivolts in amplitude from a noise level of ~100 microV through cardiorespiratory frequency coupling. A regenerative mechanism of neuronal circuits might work for the generation of large-scale oscillatory synchrony. The amplitude and phase of neuronal activity in vivo may interact cooperatively to give rise to varying degrees of power and coherence of robust rhythmic activity for distinct physiological roles. The cooperative interaction between phase adaptation and amplitude amplification of neuronal activity may provide diverse nervous systems with both robustness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Human KCNMA1 on BK Current Properties</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;BK Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are important regulators of membrane excitability. Multiple regulatory mechanisms tailor BK current properties across tissues, such as alternative splicing, posttranslational modifications, and auxiliary subunits. Another potential mechanism for modulating BK channel activity is genetic variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The gene encoding the human BK α subunit, KCNMA1, contains hundreds of SNPs. However, the variation in BK channel activity due to SNPs is not well studied. Here, we screened the effects of four SNPs (A138V, C495G, N599D, and R800W) on BK currents in HEK293T cells, selected based on predicted protein pathogenicity or disease linkage. We found that the SNPs C495G and R800W had the largest effects on BK currents, affecting the conductance–voltage relationship across multiple Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conditions in the context of two BK channel splice variants. In symmetrical K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, C495G shifted the V&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; to more hyperpolarized potentials (by −15 to −20 mV) and accelerated activation, indicating C495G confers some gain-of-function properties. R800W shifted the V&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; to more depolarized potentials (+15 to +35 mV) and slowed activation, conferring loss-of-function properties. Moreover, the C495G and R800W effects on current properties were found to persist with posttranslational modifications. In contrast, A138V and N599D had smaller and more variable effects on current properties. Neither application of alkaline phosphatase to patches, which results in increased BK channel activity attributed to channel dephosphorylation, nor bidirectional redox modulations completely abrogated SNP effects on BK currents. Lastly, in physiological K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, C495G increased the amplitude of action potential (AP)-evoked BK currents, while R800W had a more limited effect. However, the introduction of R800W in parallel with the epilepsy-linked mutation D434G (D434G/R800W) decreased the amplitude of AP-evoked BK currents compared with D434G alone. These results suggest that in a physiological context, C495G could increase BK activation, while the effects of the loss-of-function SNP R800W could oppose the gain-of-function effects of an epilepsy-linked mutation. Together, these results implicate naturally occurring human genetic variation as a potential modifier of BK channel activity across a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transgenic animal models are invaluable research tools for elucidating the pathways and mechanisms involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanistic clues can be revealed by applying labelling techniques such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridisation to brain tissue sections. Precision in both assigning anatomical location to the sections and quantifying labelled features is crucial for output validity, with a stereological approach or image-based feature extraction typically used. However, both approaches are restricted by the need to manually delineate anatomical regions. To circumvent this limitation, we present the QUINT workflow for quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in series of rodent brain section images based on available 3D reference atlases. The workflow is semi-automated, combining three open source software that can be operated without scripting knowledge, making it accessible to most researchers. As an example, a brain region-specific quantification of amyloid plaques across whole transgenic Tg2576 mouse brain series, immunohistochemically labelled for three amyloid-related antigens is demonstrated. First, the whole brain image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to produce customised atlas maps adapted to match the cutting plan and proportions of the sections (QuickNII software). Second, the labelling was segmented from the original images by the Random Forest Algorithm for supervised classification (ilastik software). Finally, the segmented images and atlas maps were used to generate plaque quantifications for each region in the reference atlas (Nutil software). The method yielded comparable results to manual delineations and to the output of a stereological method. While the use case demonstrates the QUINT workflow for quantification of amyloid plaques only, the workflow is suited to all mouse or rat brain series with labelling that is visually distinct from the background, for example for the quantification of cells or labelled proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrocorticography (ECoG) holds promise to provide efficient neuroprosthetic solutions for people suffering from neurological disabilities. This recording technique combines adequate temporal and spatial resolution with the lower risks of medical complications compared to the other invasive methods. ECoG is routinely used in clinical practice for preoperative cortical mapping in epileptic patients. During the last two decades, research utilizing ECoG has considerably grown, including the paradigms where behaviorally relevant information is extracted from ECoG activity with decoding algorithms of different complexity. Several research groups have advanced toward the development of assistive devices driven by brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode motor commands from multichannel ECoG recordings. Here we review the evolution of this field and its recent tendencies, and discuss the potential areas for future development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of retinal glial cells, particularly Müller cells, has been implicated in several retinal diseases. Despite their important contribution to retinal homeostasis, a specific way to differentiate retinal glial cells from human pluripotent stem cells has not yet been described. Here, we report a method to differentiate retinal glial cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) through promoting the Notch signaling pathway. We first generated retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) from hESCs then promoted the Notch signaling pathway using Notch ligands, including Delta-like ligand 4 and Jagged-1. We validated glial cell differentiation with qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, western blots and fluorescence-activated cell sorting as we promoted Notch signaling in RPCs. We found that promoting Notch signaling in RPCs for 2 weeks led to upregulation of glial cell markers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamine synthetase, vimentin and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP). Of these markers, we found the greatest increase in expression of the pan glial cell marker, GFAP. Conversely, we also found that inhibition of Notch signaling in RPCs led to upregulation of retinal neuronal markers including cone-rod homeobox (CRX) and orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) but with little expression of GFAP. This retinal glial differentiation method will help advance the generation of stem cell disease models to study the pathogenesis of retinal diseases associated with glial dysfunction such as macular telangiectasia type 2. This method may also be useful for the development of future therapeutics such as drug screening and gene editing using patient-derived retinal glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: BMP2 Is Related to Hirschsprung’s Disease and Required for Enteric Nervous System Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00523</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The enteric nervous system (ENS) is derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). Defects in ENS NCCs colonizing in the intestines lead to an absence of enteric ganglia in the colon and results in Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR). Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play diverse roles in the proliferation, migration and survival of ENS NCCs; however, whether BMPs are involved in HSCR and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that BMP2 expression is significantly decreased in HSCR patients. Further experiments demonstrated that BMP2 is involved in the regulation of NCC proliferation, migration and differentiation. In a detailed analysis of the role of BMP2 in HSCR development in vivo, we demonstrated that BMP2b regulates the proliferation, migration and differentiation of vagal NCCs in zebrafish and that BMP2b is required for intestinal smooth muscle development. In addition, we showed that BMP2b is involved in regulating the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the intestine, which mediates the regulation of ENS development by BMP2b in zebrafish. These results highlight a central role of the BMP-GDNF cascade in intestinal patterning and ENS development. Our results further demonstrate the key role of BMP2 in the etiology of HSCR in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mechanisms of Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapses undergo rapid activity-dependent plasticity to store information, which when left uncompensated can lead to destabilization of neural function. It has been well documented that homeostatic changes, which operate at a slower time scale, are required to maintain stability of neural networks. While there are many mechanisms that can endow homeostatic control, sliding threshold and synaptic scaling are unique in that they operate by providing homeostatic control of synaptic strength. The former mechanism operates by adjusting the threshold for synaptic plasticity, while the latter mechanism directly alters the gain of synapses. Both modes of homeostatic synaptic plasticity have been studied across various preparations from reduced in vitro systems, such as neuronal cultures, to in vivo intact circuitry. While most of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity have been worked out using reduced preparations, there are unique challenges present in intact circuitry in vivo, which deserve further consideration. For example, in an intact circuit, neurons receive distinct set of inputs across their dendritic tree which carry unique information. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vivo needs to operate without compromising processing of these distinct set of inputs to preserve information processing while maintaining network stability. In this mini review, we will summarize unique features of in vivo homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and discuss how sliding threshold and synaptic scaling may act across different activity regimes to provide homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decoupling the Effects of the Amyloid Precursor Protein From Amyloid-β Plaques on Axonal Transport Dynamics in the Living Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00501</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor to Aβ plaques. The cytoplasmic domain of APP mediates attachment of vesicles to molecular motors for axonal transport. In APP-KO mice, transport of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is decreased. In old transgenic mice expressing mutated human (APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt;) linked to Familial Alzheimer’s Disease, with both expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; and plaques, the rate and destination of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; axonal transport is altered, as detected by time-lapse manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) of the brain in living mice. To determine the relative contribution of expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; versus plaque on transport dynamics, we developed a Tet-off system to decouple expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; from plaque, and then studied hippocampal to forebrain transport by MEMRI. Three groups of mice were compared to wild-type (WT): Mice with plaque and APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression; mice with plaque but suppression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression; and mice with APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; suppressed from mating until 2 weeks before imaging with no plaque. MR images were captured before at successive time points after stereotactic injection of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (3–5 nL) into CA3 of the hippocampus. Mice were returned to their home cage between imaging sessions so that transport would occur in the awake freely moving animal. Images of multiple mice from the three groups (suppressed or expressed) together with C57/B6J WT were aligned and processed with our automated computational pipeline, and voxel-wise statistical parametric mapping (SPM) performed. At the conclusion of MR imaging, brains were harvested for biochemistry or histopathology. Paired T-tests within-group between time points (p = 0.01 FDR corrected) support the impression that both plaque alone and APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression alone alter transport rates and destination of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation. Expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; in the absence of plaque or detectable Aβ also resulted in transport defects as well as pathology of hippocampus and medial septum, suggesting two sources of pathology occur in familial Alzheimer’s disease, from toxic mutant protein as well as plaque. Alternatively mice with plaque without APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression resemble the human condition of sporadic Alzheimer’s, and had better transport. Thus, these mice with APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression suppressed after plaque formation will be most useful in preclinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Very Low Efficiency of Direct Reprogramming of Astrocytes Into Neurons in the Brains of Young and Aged Mice After Cerebral Ischemia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After cerebral ischemia, the ratio between astroglial cells and neurons in the neurovascular unit is disrupted in the perilesional area. We hypothesized that restoring the balance within the neurovascular unit may lead to an improved neurorestoration after focal ischemia. Recently, an innovative technology has been invented to efficiently convert proliferating astroglial cells into neurons in the injured young brain. However, the conversion efficacy of this technology has not been explored in the post-stroke brains of the aged rodents. To this end, we used a retroviral delivery system encoding the transcription factor Ngn2 alone or in combination with the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 to target proliferating astrocytes in the neocortex of young and aged mice after cerebral ischemia. Successful direct in vivo reprogramming of reactive glia into neuroblasts and mature neurons was assessed by cellular phenotyping. We found that the conversion efficacy of proliferating astrocytes into neurons after cerebral ischemia in young and aged mice is disappointingly low, most likely because the therapeutic vectors carrying the conversion gene are engulfed by phagocytes shortly after intracortical administration. We conclude that other viral vectors and combinations of transcription factors should be employed to improve the efficacy of glia-to-neuron conversion after stroke in young and aged rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Altered Directed Functional Connectivity of the Hippocampus in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease: A Resting-State fMRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is generally reported as one of the regions most impacted by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is closely associated with memory function and orientation. Undirected functional connectivity (FC) alterations occur in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and these alterations have been the subject of many studies. However, abnormal patterns of directed FC remain poorly understood. In this study, to identify changes in directed FC between the hippocampus and other brain regions, Granger causality analysis (GCA) based on voxels was applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 29 AD, 65 MCI, and 30 normal control (NC) subjects. The results showed significant differences in the patterns of directed FC among the three groups. There were fewer brain regions showing changes in directed FC with the hippocampus in the MCI group than the NC group, and these regions were mainly located in the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and cingulate cortex. However, regarding the abnormalities in directed FC in the AD group, the number of affected voxels was greater, the size of the clusters was larger, and the distribution was wider. Most of the abnormal connections were unidirectional and showed hemispheric asymmetry. In addition, we also investigated the correlations between the abnormal directional FCs and cognitive and clinical measurement scores in the three groups and found that some of them were significantly correlated. This study revealed abnormalities in the transmission and reception of information in the hippocampus of MCI and AD patients and offer insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this paper we investigate the rate coding capabilities of neurons whose input signal are alterations of the base state of balanced inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents. We consider different regimes of excitation-inhibition relationship and an established conductance-based leaky integrator model with adaptive threshold and parameter sets recreating biologically relevant spiking regimes. We find that given mean post-synaptic firing rate, counter-intuitively, increased ratio of inhibition to excitation generally leads to higher signal to noise ratio (SNR). On the other hand, the inhibitory input significantly reduces the dynamic coding range of the neuron. We quantify the joint effect of SNR and dynamic coding range by computing the metabolic efficiency—the maximal amount of information per one ATP molecule expended (in bits/ATP). Moreover, by calculating the metabolic efficiency we are able to predict the shapes of the post-synaptic firing rate histograms that may be tested on experimental data. Likewise, optimal stimulus input distributions are predicted, however, we show that the optimum can essentially be reached with a broad range of input distributions. Finally, we examine which parameters of the used neuronal model are the most important for the metabolically efficient information transfer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3ruuWS6-k7A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A key task in cancer genomics research is to identify cancer driver genes. As these genes initialise and progress cancer, understanding them is critical in designing effective cancer interventions. Although there are several methods developed to discover cancer drivers, most of them only identify coding drivers. However, non-coding RNAs can regulate driver mutations to develop cancer. Hence, novel methods are required to reveal both coding and non-coding cancer drivers. In this paper, we develop a novel framework named Controllability based Biological Network Analysis (CBNA) to uncover coding and non-coding cancer drivers (i.e. miRNA cancer drivers). CBNA integrates different genomic data types, including gene expression, gene network, mutation data, and contains a two-stage process: (1) Building a network for a condition (e.g. cancer condition) and (2) Identifying drivers. The application of CBNA to the BRCA dataset demonstrates that it is more effective than the existing methods in detecting coding cancer drivers. In addition, CBNA also predicts 17 miRNA drivers for breast cancer. Some of these predicted miRNA drivers have been validated by literature and the rest can be good candidates for wet-lab validation. We further use CBNA to detect subtype-specific cancer drivers and several predicted drivers have been confirmed to be related to breast cancer subtypes. Another application of CBNA is to discover epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) drivers. Of the predicted EMT drivers, 7 coding and 6 miRNA drivers are in the known EMT gene lists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u8H3dSyh0rM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Quantifying cell-type proportions and their corresponding gene expression profiles in tissue samples would enhance understanding of the contributions of individual cell types to the physiological states of the tissue. Current approaches that address tissue heterogeneity have drawbacks. Experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single cell RNA sequencing are expensive. Computational approaches that use expression data from heterogeneous samples are promising, but most of the current methods estimate either cell-type proportions or cell-type-specific expression profiles by requiring the other as input. Although such partial deconvolution methods have been successfully applied to tumor samples, the additional input required may be unavailable. We introduce a novel complete deconvolution method, CDSeq, that uses only RNA-Seq data from bulk tissue samples to simultaneously estimate both cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific expression profiles. Using several synthetic and real experimental datasets with known cell-type composition and cell-type-specific expression profiles, we compared CDSeq’s complete deconvolution performance with seven other established deconvolution methods. Complete deconvolution using CDSeq represents a substantial technical advance over partial deconvolution approaches and will be useful for studying cell mixtures in tissue samples. CDSeq is available at GitHub repository (MATLAB and Octave code): https://github.com/kkang7/CDSeq.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtLPvdJwv7Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Signal propagation over long distances is a ubiquitous feature of multicellular communities, but cell-to-cell variability can cause propagation to be highly heterogeneous. Simple models of signal propagation in heterogenous media, such as percolation theory, can potentially provide a quantitative understanding of these processes, but it is unclear whether these simple models properly capture the complexities of multicellular systems. We recently discovered that in biofilms of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the propagation of an electrical signal is statistically consistent with percolation theory, and yet it is reasonable to suspect that key features of this system go beyond the simple assumptions of basic percolation theory. Indeed, we find here that the probability for a cell to signal is not independent from other cells as assumed in percolation theory, but instead is correlated with its nearby neighbors. We develop a mechanistic model, in which correlated signaling emerges from cell division, phenotypic inheritance, and cell displacement, that reproduces the experimentally observed correlations. We find that the correlations do not significantly affect the spatial statistics, which we rationalize using a renormalization argument. Moreover, the fraction of signaling cells is not constant in space, as assumed in percolation theory, but instead varies within and across biofilms. We find that this feature lowers the fraction of signaling cells at which one observes the characteristic power-law statistics of cluster sizes, consistent with our experimental results. We validate the model using a mutant biofilm whose signaling probability decays along the propagation direction. Our results reveal key statistical features of a correlated signaling process in a multicellular community. More broadly, our results identify extensions to percolation theory that do or do not alter its predictions and may be more appropriate for biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uZzyDeJ1X2E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational study on the role of glutamate and NMDA receptors on cortical spreading depression using a multidomain electrodiffusion model</title>

Cortical spreading depression (SD) is a spreading disruption of ionic homeostasis in the brain during which neurons experience complete and prolonged depolarizations. SD is the basis of migraine aura and is increasingly associated with many other brain pathologies. Here, we study the role of glutamate and NMDA receptor dynamics in the context of an ionic electrodiffusion model. We perform simulations in one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimension. Our 1D simulations reproduce the “inverted saddle” shape of the extracellular voltage signal for the first time. Our simulations suggest that SD propagation depends on two overlapping mechanisms; one dependent on extracellular glutamate diffusion and NMDA receptors and the other dependent on extracellular potassium diffusion and persistent sodium channel conductance. In 2D simulations, we study the dynamics of spiral waves. We study the properties of the spiral waves in relation to the planar 1D wave, and also compute the energy expenditure associated with the recurrent SD spirals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6B7JcLlTVrw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A cell-based probabilistic approach unveils the concerted action of miRNAs</title>

Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate most human genes through direct base-pairing with mRNAs. We investigate the underlying principles of miRNA regulation in living cells. To this end, we overexpressed miRNAs in different cell types and measured the mRNA decay rate under a paradigm of a transcriptional arrest. Based on an exhaustive matrix of mRNA-miRNA binding probabilities, and parameters extracted from our experiments, we developed a computational framework that captures the cooperative action of miRNAs in living cells. The framework, called COMICS, simulates the stochastic binding events between miRNAs and mRNAs in cells. The input of COMICS is cell-specific profiles of mRNAs and miRNAs, and the outcome is the retention level of each mRNA at the end of 100,000 iterations. The results of COMICS from thousands of miRNA manipulations reveal gene sets that exhibit coordinated behavior with respect to all miRNAs (total of 248 families). We identified a small set of genes that are highly responsive to changes in the expression of almost any of the miRNAs. In contrast, about 20% of the tested genes remain insensitive to a broad range of miRNA manipulations. The set of insensitive genes is strongly enriched with genes that belong to the translation machinery. These trends are shared by different cell types. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNAs reveals unexpected robustness of gene expression in living cells. By applying a systematic probabilistic approach some key design principles of cell states are revealed, emphasizing in particular, the immunity of the translational machinery vis-a-vis miRNA manipulations across cell types. We propose COMICS as a valuable platform for assessing the outcome of miRNA regulation of cells in health and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J1VJIPK0p1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Autistic traits influence the strategic diversity of information sampling: Insights from two-stage decision models</title>

Information sampling can reduce uncertainty in future decisions but is often costly. To maximize reward, people need to balance sampling cost and information gain. Here we aimed to understand how autistic traits influence the optimality of information sampling and to identify the particularly affected cognitive processes. Healthy human adults with different levels of autistic traits performed a probabilistic inference task, where they could sequentially sample information to increase their likelihood of correct inference and may choose to stop at any moment. We manipulated the cost and evidence associated with each sample and compared participants’ performance to strategies that maximize expected gain. We found that participants were overall close to optimal but also showed autistic-trait-related differences. Participants with higher autistic traits had a higher efficiency of winning rewards when the sampling cost was zero but a lower efficiency when the cost was high and the evidence was more ambiguous. Computational modeling of participants’ sampling choices and decision times revealed a two-stage decision process, with the second stage being an optional second thought. Participants may consider cost in the first stage and evidence in the second stage, or in the reverse order. The probability of choosing to stop sampling at a specific stage increases with increasing cost or increasing evidence. Surprisingly, autistic traits did not influence the decision in either stage. However, participants with higher autistic traits inclined to consider cost first, while those with lower autistic traits considered cost or evidence first in a more balanced way. This would lead to the observed autistic-trait-related advantages or disadvantages in sampling optimality, depending on whether the optimal sampling strategy is determined only by cost or jointly by cost and evidence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dVMOYje6s7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Possible Effect of Binaural Beat Combined With Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response for Inducing Sleep</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is important to maintain physical and cognitive functions in everyday life. However, the prevalence of sleep disorders is on the rise. One existing solution to this problem is to induce sleep using an auditory stimulus. When we listen to acoustic beats of two tones in each ear simultaneously, a binaural beat is generated which induces brain signals at a specific desired frequency. However, this auditory stimulus is uncomfortable for users to listen to induce sleep. To overcome this difficulty, we can exploit the feelings of calmness and relaxation that are induced by the perceptual phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). In this study, we proposed a novel auditory stimulus for inducing sleep. Specifically, we used a 6 Hz binaural beat corresponding to the center of the theta band (4–8 Hz), which is the frequency at which brain activity is entrained during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) in sleep stage 1. In addition, the “ASMR triggers” that cause ASMR were presented from natural sound as the sensory stimuli. In session 1, we combined two auditory stimuli (the 6 Hz binaural beat and ASMR triggers) at three-decibel ratios to find the optimal combination ratio. As a result, we determined that the combination of a 30:60 dB ratio of binaural beat to ASMR trigger is most effective for inducing theta power and psychological stability. In session 2, the effects of these combined stimuli (CS) were compared with an only binaural beat, only the ASMR trigger, or a sham condition. The combination stimulus retained the advantages of the binaural beat and resolved its shortcomings with the ASMR triggers, including psychological self-reports. Our findings indicate that the proposed auditory stimulus could induce the brain signals required for sleep, while simultaneously keeping the user in a psychologically comfortable state. This technology provides an important opportunity to develop a novel method for increasing the quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is generally accepted that these signals are defined with respect to the external world (i.e., a world-centered, or allocentric, frame of reference). Recently, evidence of egocentric processing (i.e., self-centered, defined relative to the subject) in the extended hippocampal system has accumulated. These results support the idea that egocentric sensory information, derived from primary sensory cortical areas, may be transformed to allocentric representations that interact with the allocentric hippocampal system. We propose a framework to explain the implications of the egocentric-allocentric transformations to the functions of the medial temporal lobe memory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Identification of Restless Legs Syndrome Genes by Mutational Load Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with substantial burden on individual wellbeing and public health. Genetic risk loci have been identified but the causatives genes at these loci are largely unknown, so that functional investigation and clinical translation of molecular research data are still inhibited. To identify putatively causative genes we searched for highly significant mutational burden in candidate genes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 84 candidate genes in 4,649 patients and 4,982 controls by next generation sequencing using molecular inversion probes that targeted mainly coding regions. The burden of low‐frequency and rare variants was assessed, and in addition, an algorithm (binomial performance deviation analysis) was established to estimate independently the sequence variation in the probe binding regions from the variation in sequencing depth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly significant results (considering the number of genes in the genome) of the conventional burden test and the binomial performance deviation analysis overlapped significantly. Fourteen genes were highly significant by one method and confirmed with nominal significance by the other to show a differential burden of low‐frequency and rare variants in restless legs syndrome. Nine of them (&lt;i&gt;AAGAB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATP2C1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNTN4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;COL6A6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GLO1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NTNG1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;STEAP4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VAV3&lt;/i&gt;) resided in the vicinity of known restless legs syndrome loci while five (&lt;i&gt;BBS7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CADM1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CREB5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NRG3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SUN1&lt;/i&gt;) have not previously been associated with restless legs syndrome. Burden test and binomial performance deviation analysis also converged significantly in fine‐mapping potentially causative domains within these genes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differential burden with intragenic low‐frequency variants reveals putatively causative genes in restless legs syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past years powerful tools specifically designed to aid the measurement of behavior have come to fruition. Here we discuss how capturing the postures of animals — pose estimation - has been rapidly advancing with new deep learning methods. While challenges still remain, we envision that the fast-paced development of new deep learning tools will rapidly change the landscape of realizable real-world neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Self‐Reported Head Trauma Predicts Poor Dual Task Gait in Retired National Football League Players</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25638?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25638?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic head trauma associated with American‐style football (ASF) has been linked to brain pathology, along with physical and mental distress in later life. However, the longer‐term effects of such trauma on objective metrics of cognitive–motor function remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that ASF‐related symptomatic head trauma would predict worse gait performance, particularly during dual task conditions (ie, walking while performing an additional cognitive task), in later life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty‐six retired professional ASF players aged 29 to 75 years completed a health and wellness questionnaire. They also completed a validated smartphone‐based assessment in their own homes, during which gait was monitored while they walked normally and while they performed a verbalized serial‐subtraction cognitive task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who reported more symptomatic head trauma, defined as the total number of impacts to the head or neck followed by concussion‐related symptoms, exhibited greater dual task cost (ie, percentage increase) to stride time variability (ie, the coefficient of variation of mean stride time). Those who reported ≥1 hit followed by loss of consciousness, compared to those who did not, also exhibited greater dual task costs to this metric. Relationships between reported trauma and dual task costs were independent of age, body mass index, National Football League career duration, and history of musculoskeletal surgery. Symptomatic head trauma was not correlated with average stride times in either walking condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote, smartphone‐based assessments of dual task walking may be utilized to capture meaningful data sensitive to the long‐term impact of symptomatic head trauma in former professional ASF players and other contact sport athletes. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The nematode &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; provides an opportunity to define evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of regulation of host innate immunity and inflammation in a genetically tractable whole-animal system. In the past few years, the &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; nervous system has emerged as an integral part of host defense against pathogens, acting through diverse mechanisms to repress or induce protective transcriptional responses to infection in distal tissues. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the mechanisms through which the &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; nervous system controls the expression of host defense genes in the intestinal epithelium. Although still incomplete, the insights derived from such work have broad implications for neural regulation of epithelial function at mucosal barriers in higher organisms in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438819301059-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Safety and Efficacy of Otaplimastat in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Requiring tPA (SAFE‐TPA): A Multicenter, Randomized, Double‐Blind, Placebo‐Controlled Phase 2 Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otaplimastat is a neuroprotectant that inhibits matrix metalloprotease pathway, and reduces edema and intracerebral hemorrhage induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in animal stroke models. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of otaplimastat in patients receiving rtPA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase 2, 2‐part, multicenter trial in stroke patients (19–80 years old) receiving rtPA. Intravenous otaplimastat was administered &amp;lt;30 minutes after rtPA. Stage 1 was a single‐arm, open‐label safety study in 11 patients. Otaplimastat 80 mg was administered twice daily for 3 days. Stage 2 was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 69 patients, assigned (1:1:1) to otaplimastat 40 mg, otaplimastat 80 mg, or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma (PH) on day 1. Secondary endpoints included serious adverse events (SAEs), mortality, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution at 90 days (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; identifier: NCT02787278).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No safety issues were encountered in stage 1. The incidence of PH during stage 2 was comparable: 0 of 22 with the placebo, 0 of 22 with otaplimastat 40 mg, and 1 of 21 with the 80 mg dose. No differences in SAEs (13%, 17%, 14%) or death (8.3%, 4.2%, 4.8%) were observed among the 3 groups. Three adverse events (chills, muscle rigidity, hepatotoxicity) were judged to be related to otaplimastat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous otaplimastat adjunctive therapy in patients receiving rtPA is feasible and generally safe. The functional efficacy of otaplimastat needs to be investigated with further large trials. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Alpha Isoform of Heat Shock Protein 90 and the Co-chaperones p23 and Cdc37 Promote Opioid Anti-nociception in the Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Opioid activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) promotes signaling cascades that evoke both analgesic responses to pain and side effects like addiction and dependence. Manipulation of these cascades, such as by biased agonism, has great promise to improve opioid therapy. However, the signaling cascades of the MOR are in general poorly understood, providing few targets for drug development. In our earlier work, we identified Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a novel and crucial regulator of opioid anti-nociception in the brain by promoting ERK MAPK activation. In this study, we sought to identify the molecular isoforms and co-chaperones by which Hsp90 carried out this role, which could provide specific targets for future clinical intervention. We used novel selective small molecule inhibitors as well as CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing constructs delivered by the intracerebroventricular (icv) route to the brains of adult CD-1 mice to target Hsp90 isoforms (Hsp90α/β, Grp94) and co-chaperones (p23, Cdc37, Aha1). We found that inhibition of the isoform Hsp90α fully blocked morphine anti-nociception in a model of post-surgical paw incision pain, while blocking ERK and JNK MAPK activation, suggesting Hsp90α as the main regulator of opioid response in the brain. We further found that inhibition of the co-chaperones p23 and Cdc37 blocked morphine anti-nociception, suggesting that these co-chaperones assist Hsp90α in promoting opioid anti-nociception. Lastly, we used cycloheximide treatment in the brain to demonstrate that rapid protein translation within 30 min of opioid treatment is required for Hsp90 regulation of opioid response. Together these studies provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp90 promotes opioid anti-nociception. These findings thus both improve our basic science knowledge of MOR signal transduction and could provide future targets for clinical intervention to improve opioid therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Amphetamine and the Smart Drug 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) Induce Generalization of Fear Memory in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00292</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human studies have consistently shown that drugs of abuse affect memory function. The psychostimulants amphetamine and the “bath salt” 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) increase brain monoamine levels through a similar, yet not identical, mechanism of action. Findings indicate that amphetamine enhances the consolidation of memory for emotional experiences, but still MDPV effects on memory function are underinvestigated. Here, we tested the effects induced by these two drugs on generalization of fear memory and their relative neurobiological underpinnings. To this aim, we used a modified version of the classical inhibitory avoidance task, termed inhibitory avoidance discrimination task. According to such procedure, adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were first exposed to one inhibitory avoidance apparatus and, with a 1-min delay, to a second apparatus where they received an inescapable footshock. Forty-eight hours later, retention latencies were tested, in a randomized order, in the two training apparatuses as well as in a novel contextually modified apparatus to assess both strength and generalization of memory. Our results indicated that both amphetamine and MDPV induced generalization of fear memory, whereas only amphetamine enhanced memory strength. Co-administration of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol prevented the effects of both amphetamine and MDPV on the strength and generalization of memory. The dopaminergic receptor blocker cis-flupenthixol selectively reversed the amphetamine effect on memory generalization. These findings indicate that amphetamine and MDPV induce generalization of fear memory through different modulations of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Expression Profile and Potential Functions of Circulating Long Noncoding RNAs in Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Southern Chinese Han Population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00290</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00290</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to be associated with ischemic stroke (IS); however, their involvement still needs to be extensively explored. Therefore, we aimed to study the expression profile of lncRNAs and the potential roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the Southern Chinese Han population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in AIS were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and network analyses were performed to predict the functions and interactions of the aberrantly expressed genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of lncRNAs in AIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: RNA-Seq analysis showed that 428 lncRNAs and 957 mRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 791 lncRNAs and 4,263 mRNAs were downregulated in patients with AIS when compared with healthy controls. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes showed that the apoptosis, inflammatory, oxidative and calcium signaling pathways were potentially implicated in AIS pathology. The PCR results showed that the selected lncRNA-C14orf64 and lncRNA-AC136007.2 were significantly downregulated in AIS. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of lncRNA-C14orf64 and lncRNA-AC136007.2 between AIS and healthy controls were 0.74 and 0.94, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study provides evidence of altered expression of lncRNAs and their potential functions in AIS. Our findings may facilitate pathological mechanistic studies of lncRNAs in AIS and provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Transcriptomic and Network Analysis Highlight the Association of Diabetes at Different Stages of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are among the most prevalent chronic diseases affecting the aging population. Extensive research evidence indicates that T2D is a well-established risk factor for AD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, how T2D may contribute to the progression of AD is a subject of extensive investigation. In this study, we compared the blood transcriptome of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and advanced AD to those afflicted with T2D to unveil shared and unique pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Blood transcriptomic analyses revealed a positive correlation between gene expression profiles of MCI, AD, and T2D in seven independent microarrays. Interestingly, gene expression profiles from women with advanced AD correlated negatively with T2D, suggesting sex-specific differences in T2D as a risk factor for AD. Network and pathway analysis revealed that shared molecular networks between MCI and T2D were predominantly enriched in inflammation and infectious diseases whereas those networks shared between overt AD and T2D were involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway, a major mediator of insulin signaling in the body. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway became more significantly dysregulated in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Furthermore, endocrine resistance and atherosclerosis pathways emerged as dysregulated pathways in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Interestingly, network analysis of shared differentially expressed genes between children with T2D and MCI subjects identified forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a central transcriptional regulator, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in AD. Collectively, these results suggest that T2D may be implicated at different stages of AD through different molecular pathways disrupted during the preclinical phase of AD and more advanced stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Large-Scale Simulation of a Layered Cortical Sheet of Spiking Network Model Using a Tile Partitioning Method</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the grand challenges for computational neuroscience and high-performance computing is computer simulation of a human-scale whole brain model with spiking neurons and synaptic plasticity using supercomputers. To achieve such a simulation, the target network model must be partitioned onto a number of computational nodes, and the sub-network models are executed in parallel while communicating spike information across different nodes. However, it remains unclear how the target network model should be partitioned for efficient computing on next generation of supercomputers. Specifically, reducing the communication of spike information across compute nodes is essential, because of the relatively slower network performance than processor and memory. From the viewpoint of biological features, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum contain 99% of neurons and synapses and form layered sheet structures. Therefore, an efficient method to split the network should exploit the layered sheet structures. In this study, we indicate that a tile partitioning method leads to efficient communication. To demonstrate it, a simulation software called MONET (Millefeuille-like Organization NEural neTwork simulator) that partitions a network model as described above was developed. The MONET simulator was implemented on the Japanese flagship supercomputer K, which is composed of 82,944 computational nodes. We examined a performance of calculation, communication and memory consumption in the tile partitioning method for a cortical model with realistic anatomical and physiological parameters. The result showed that the tile partitioning method drastically reduced communication data amount by replacing network communication with DRAM access and sharing the communication data with neighboring neurons. We confirmed the scalability and efficiency of the tile partitioning method on up to 63,504 compute nodes of the K computer for the cortical model. In the companion paper by Yamaura et al., the performance for a cerebellar model was examined. These results suggest that the tile partitioning method will have advantage for a human-scale whole-brain simulation on exascale computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The incidence of symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is increasing in Chinese aging population, but its clinical and demographic knowledge is still lacking. This study sought to outline the clinical and demographic data of CSDH patients from two medical centers in Tianjin and Chongqing to provide a better understanding for CSDH treatment in China.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Age, sex, etiologies, conscious level on admission, treatment strategies, outcome at discharge, recurrence, and concomitant disease of enrolled patients were recorded. The data were further analyzed after the patients were sub-grouped into young/middle (less than 60 years old) and old (over than 60 years old) age groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 1281 CSDH patients were enrolled. Of these, 85.01% were male and 51.91% were aged between 60 and 80 years. 57.61% patients encountered head trauma before diagnosing CSDH. The top three clinical symptoms at admission were headache (58.55%), dyskinesia (36.92%), and dizziness (33.96%). Headache as well as dizziness often happened in young/middle age group, while dyskinesia often occurred in the old age group. The most common concomitant diseases were cardio-cerebrovascular system diseases (41.14%). The concomitant respiratory diseases in aged patients led to unfavorable outcomes (p = 0.049, OR:0.357). The prognosis of old age subgroup receiving conservative treatment was better than those who received burr-hole drainage treatment (p &amp;lt; 0.015, OR:4.091).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CSDH mostly occurs in aged and male population with a history a head trauma. The respiratory disease often results in unfavorable outcomes in aged patients. Conservative treatment might benefit some patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial of IVIG in autoimmune LGI1/CASPR2 epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25655?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug‐resistant seizures are common in patients with Leucine‐rich, glioma‐inactivated‐1 (LGI1) and contactin‐associated‐protein‐like‐2 (CASPR2)‐IgG associated encephalitis. We performed the first randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in reducing seizure frequency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our enrollment goal was 30 LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG‐seropositive adult patients with ≥2 seizures per‐week. Patients were randomized to receive IVIG (0.5g/kg day‐1, 1g/kg day‐2, 0.6g/kg week 3 and 5) or volume‐matched intravenous normal saline. Following the blinded‐phase, the non‐responders in the placebo group received IVIG. The primary clinical outcome was 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to 5 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enrollment of 17 patients (LGI1‐IgG, 14; CASPR2‐IgG, 3) over 34 months the study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Six of eight patients in the IVIG group were responders compared to two of nine in the placebo group (p=0.044, OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 98.9). For the LGI1‐IgG seropositive subgroup: 6 of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to zero of 6 in the placebo group. Two LGI1‐IgG seropositive patients receiving IVIG, but none receiving placebo, were seizure free at the end of the blinded‐phase. Four of the six patients entering the open‐label IVIG arm reported ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. There were no correlations with LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG1‐4 subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpreation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superiority of IVIG to placebo reached statistical significance for the primary end‐point for all patients and the subset with LGI1‐IgG. These results have to be interpreted with the caveat that the study did not reach its originally selected sample size.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Elevated Level of PKMζ Underlies the Excessive Anxiety in an Autism Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects the life quality of a significant percentage of autism patients. To understand the possible biological basis of this high anxiety level, we used a valproic acid (VPA) model of autism. Anxiety level is significantly higher in VPA-injected mice, at both P35 and P70. In addition, protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) level in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is significantly higher in VPA mice at both ages. Consistent with this finding, infusion of a PKMζ-blocking peptide z-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into BLA significantly reduced anxiety levels in VPA mice. Furthermore, viral overexpression of PKMζ in the BLA led to elevated anxiety level in Wild Type (WT) mice, with concomitant higher intrinsic excitability of BLA excitatory neurons. Altogether, our results indicate a key contribution of BLA PKMζ level to anxiety, especially in autism; and this finding may provide a further understanding of the pathogenesis as well as treatment of anxiety symptoms in autism patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The results from epidemiologic studies linking blood folate concentrations, folic acid supplementation, or dietary folate to the risk of preterm birth are inconsistent. In this study, we aimed to summarize the available evidence on these associations. A systematic search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to October 20, 2018 was performed and reference lists of retrieved articles were screened. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest vs. the lowest levels of folate concentrations, folic acid supplementation, and dietary folate were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regression were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Ten studies (six prospective cohort studies and four case-control studies) were included on folate concentrations, 13 cohort studies were included about folic acid supplementation, and 4 cohort studies were included regarding dietary folate intake. Higher maternal folate levels were associated with a 28% reduction in the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.93). Higher folic acid supplementation was associated with 10% lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.95). In addition, a significant negative association was observed between dietary folate intake and the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.84), but no significant relation was seen between dietary folate and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57–1.41). In the subgroup analysis, higher maternal folate levels in the third trimester were associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.94). To initiate taking folic acid supplementation early before conception was adversely associated with preterm birth risk (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83–0.95). In conclusion, higher maternal folate levels and folic acid supplementation were significantly associated with a lower risk of preterm birth. The limited data currently available suggest that dietary folate is associated with a significantly decreased risk of preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: MiR-409-5p as a Regulator of Neurite Growth Is Down Regulated in APP/PS1 Murine Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that miRNA expression changes are associated with the development of AD. Our previous study showed that the expression level of miR-409-5p was stably downregulated in the early stage of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice model of AD. We now report that miR-409-5p impairs neurite outgrowth, decreases neuronal viability, and accelerates the progression of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pathologies. In this study, we found that Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; peptide significantly decreased the expression of miR-409-5p, which was consistent with the expression profile of miR-409-5p in the APP/PS1 mice cortexes. Plek was confirmed to be a potential regulatory target of miR-409-5p by luciferase assay and Western blotting. Overexpression of miR-409-5p has an obvious neurotoxicity in neuronal cell viability and differentiation, whereas Plek overexpression could partially rescue neurite outgrowth from this toxicity. Some cytoskeleton regulatory proteins have been found to be related to AD pathogenesis. Our data show some clues that cytoskeletal reorganization may play roles in AD pathology. The early downregulation of miR-409-5p in AD progression might be a self-protective reaction to alleviate the synaptic damage induced by Aβ, which may be used as a potential early biomarker of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Endovascular treatment of large or giant non-saccular vertebrobasilar aneurysms (VBAs) by conventional stents is difficult and has unsatisfactory outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;Object&lt;p&gt;This study was performed to retrospectively analyze the safety and efficacy of a flow diverter in treating large and giant non-saccular VBAs.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 patients with 83 large or giant non-saccular VBAs who accepted endovascular treatment with a pipeline embolization device (PED) or conventional stent from January 2014 to June 2018. The technical details of the procedure, procedure-associated complications, angiographic outcomes, and clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Forty-two patients (53.8%, 42/78) with 44 aneurysms (53.0%, 44/83) underwent endovascular treatment with PEDs. Thirty-six patients (46.2%, 36/78) with 39 aneurysms (47.0%, 39/83) underwent endovascular treatment with conventional stents. The complication rate of PED group and conventional stent group was 7.1% (3/42) and 5.6% (2/36), respectively (odds ratio, 0.765; 95% confidence interval, 0.121–4.851; P = 0.776). During a median follow-up time of 28.8 months, the complete occlusion rate in the PED group and conventional stent group was 90.2% (37/41) and 70.3% (26/37), respectively (odds ratio, 3.913; 95% confidence interval, 1.122–13.652; P = 0.032).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Endovascular treatment with a PED is a promising and safe modality for large and giant non-saccular VBAs, and the complication rate is acceptable, compared with conventional endovascular treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Microstate Changes Associated With Alzheimer’s Disease in Persons With Down Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01251</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is associated with development of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, due to considerable heterogeneity in intellectual function among persons with DS, it is difficult to assess whether a person with DS has developed dementia due to AD (DS-AD). EEG spectral power has previously shown very promising results with increased slowing in DS-AD compared to DS. However, another technique called microstates may be used to assess whole-brain dynamics and has to our knowledge not previously been investigated in either DS or DS-AD. The aim of the current study was to assess whether microstates could be used to differentiate between adults with DS, and DS-AD. We included EEGs from 10 persons with DS and 15 persons with DS-AD in the analysis. For the microstate analyses, we calculated four global maps, which were then back-fitted to all the EEGs. Lastly, we extracted the duration, occurrence, and coverage for each of the microstates. Here, we found the four archetypical maps as has previously been reported in the literature. We did not find any significant difference between DS and DS-AD but the largest difference in microstate duration between DS and DS-AD was found in microstate A and D. These findings are in line with structural MR studies showing that both the frontal and temporal lobes are affected in persons with DS-AD. Microstates may potentially serve as a diagnostic marker, but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to Improve Gait in Multiple Sclerosis: A Timing Window Comparison</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00420</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Unilateral weakness of the lower limb is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a significant contributor to the progressive worsening of walking ability. There are currently no effective rehabilitation strategies targeting strength asymmetries and/or gait impairments in people with MS (PwMS). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has improved motor outcomes in various populations, but the effect of tDCS on gait in PwMS and the ideal timing window of tDCS application are still unknown. This study investigated the effects of tDCS, either before or during a 6 min walk test (6MWT), on the distance walked and gait characteristics in PwMS. Twelve participants were recruited and randomly assigned into BEFORE or DURING groups (both n = 6). The BEFORE group received stimulation before performing a 6MWT (sham/2 mA, 13 min). The DURING group received stimulation only during a 6MWT (sham/2 mA, 6 min). Stimulation was over the more MS-affected primary motor cortex (M1). Distance walked and gait characteristics of the walk were the primary and secondary outcomes. The results indicated a significant decrease in distance walked in the DURING group (p = 0.026) and a significant increase in gait velocity in the BEFORE group (p = 0.04). These changes were accompanied by trends (p &amp;lt; 0.1) in distance walked, gait velocity, and stride length. Overall, the results of this study suggest that tDCS performed before a 6MWT might be more effective than tDCS during a 6MWT and that a single session of tDCS may not be sufficient to influence gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier #NCT03757819.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Determinants of combination GM-CSF immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy success identified through &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; treatment personalization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tyler Cassidy, Morgan Craig&lt;/p&gt;

Oncolytic virotherapies, including the modified herpes simplex virus talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), have shown great promise as potent instigators of anti-tumour immune effects. The OPTiM trial, in particular, demonstrated the superior anti-cancer effects of T-VEC as compared to systemic immunotherapy treatment using exogenous administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Theoretically, a combined approach leveraging exogenous cytokine immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy would elicit an even greater immune response and improve patient outcomes. However, regimen scheduling of combination immunostimulation and T-VEC therapy has yet to be established. Here, we calibrate a computational biology model of sensitive and resistant tumour cells and immune interactions for implementation into an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; clinical trial to test and individualize combination immuno- and virotherapy. By personalizing and optimizing combination oncolytic virotherapy and immunostimulatory therapy, we show improved simulated patient outcomes for individuals with late-stage melanoma. More crucially, through evaluation of individualized regimens, we identified determinants of combination GM-CSF and T-VEC therapy that can be translated into clinically-actionable dosing strategies without further personalization. Our results serve as a proof-of-concept for interdisciplinary approaches to determining combination therapy, and suggest promising avenues of investigation towards tailored combination immunotherapy/oncolytic virotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z-PEZKQFdTc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: How the human brain sleeps: Direct cortical recordings of normal brain activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25651?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25651?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional variations in oscillatory activity during human sleep remain unknown. Using the unique ability of intracranial electroencephalography to study in‐situ brain physiology, this study assesses regional variations of electroencephalographic sleep activity and creates the first atlas of human sleep using recordings from the first sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings with channels displaying physiological activity from non‐lesional tissue were selected from 91 patients of three tertiary epilepsy centers. Sections during non‐rapid eye movement sleep (N2, N3) and rapid eye movement sleep (R) were selected from the first sleep cycle for oscillatory and non‐oscillatory signal analysis. Results of 1468 channels were grouped into 38 regions covering all cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found regional differences in the distribution of sleep transients and spectral content, during all sleep stages. There was a caudo‐rostral gradient with more slow frequencies and fewer spindles in temporo‐parieto‐occipital than in frontal cortex. Moreover, deep‐seated structures showed spectral peaks differing from the baseline electroencephalogram. The regions with &amp;gt;60% of channels presenting significant rhythmic activity were either mesial or temporal basal structures that contribute minimally to the scalp EEG. Finally, during deeper sleep stages, electroencephalographic analysis revealed a more homogeneous spatial distribution, with increased coupling between high and low frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a better understanding of the regional variability of sleep, and establishes a baseline for human sleep in all cortical regions during the first sleep cycle. Furthermore, the open‐access atlas will be a unique resource for research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://mni‐open‐ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Midlife Atherosclerosis and Development of Alzheimer or Vascular Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25645?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether midlife atherosclerosis is associated with different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish prospective population‐based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103). Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991–1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical records. In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n = 330), β‐amyloid&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009–2015).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 20 years of follow‐up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean age at baseline = 57.5 ± 5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all‐cause dementia (adjusted HR = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.10–1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.77–1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a 3‐graded score (adjusted HR = 1.90 [95% CI = 1.07–3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8 ± 4.6 years at baseline, 60% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47 [95% CI = 1.05–2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted OR = 1.28 [95% CI = 0.87–1.90] for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.35 [95% CI = 0.86–2.13] for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/p‐tau). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings support an association between midlife atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel disease but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD dementia or AD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Comparison of the Response to Rituximab between Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Aquaporin‐4 Antibody Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25648?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25648?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare response to rituximab (RTX) between adult patients positive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and aquaporin‐4 (AQP4) antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively studied adult patients with MOG or AQP4 antibodies who received RTX under an individualized dosing schedule adapted to the biological effect of RTX monitored by memory B‐cell measurement. Memory B cells were counted monthly and when relapse occurred. The biological effect of RTX was considered significant with &amp;lt;0.05% memory B cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 16 patients with MOG antibodies and 29 with AQP4 antibodies, mean follow‐up was 19 (range = 9–38) and 38 (13–79) months. Under RTX, 10 relapses occurred in 6 of 16 (37.5%) patients with MOG antibodies, and 13 occurred in 7 of 29 (24%) with AQP4 antibodies. The median time of relapse after the most recent infusion was 2.6 (0.6–5.8) and 7 (0.8–13) months, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Memory B cells had reemerged in 2 of 10 (20%) relapses in patients with MOG antibodies and 12 of 13 (92.5%) with AQP4 antibodies (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In AQP4 antibody–associated disorder, relapse mostly occurs when the biological effect of RTX decreases, which argues for treatment efficacy. In MOG antibody–associated disorder, the efficacy of RTX is not constant, because one‐third of patients showed relapse despite an effective biological effect of RTX. In this subpopulation, memory B‐cell depletion was unable to prevent relapse, which was probably caused by different immunological mechanisms. These findings should be used to improve treatment strategies for MOG antibody–associated disorder. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Early Intrathecal T Helper 17.1 Cell Activity in Huntington Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25647?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25647?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin &lt;i&gt;(HTT)&lt;/i&gt; gene. No disease‐modifying therapy exists for the treatment of patients with HD. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate early disease mechanisms that potentially could be used as a target therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and controls was analyzed by techniques based on flow cytometry and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities before motor onset of disease. In CSF of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL‐17, and increased consumption of the lymphocyte growth factor IL‐7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we observed an increased prevalence of IL‐17–producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre–motor manifest individuals. The frequency of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of HD and the level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the early disease stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between proinflammatory and regulatory T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory intrathecal environment in &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that Th17.1 cells are implicated in the earliest pathogenic phases of HD and suggest that treatment to dampen T ‐cell–driven inflammation before motor onset might be of benefit in &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is generally thought that muscle excitability is almost exclusively controlled by currents responsible for generation of action potentials. We propose that smaller ion channel currents that contribute to setting the resting potential and to subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential can also modulate excitability in important ways. These channels open at voltages more negative than the action potential threshold and are thus termed subthreshold currents. As subthreshold currents are orders of magnitude smaller than the currents responsible for the action potential, they are hard to identify and easily overlooked. Discovery of their importance in regulation of excitability opens new avenues for improved therapy for muscle channelopathies and diseases of the neuromuscular junction.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: NCS-1 Deficiency Affects mRNA Levels of Genes Involved in Regulation of ATP Synthesis and Mitochondrial Stress in Highly Vulnerable Substantia nigra Dopaminergic Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor proteins (NCS) transduce changes in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis into altered signaling and neuronal function. NCS-1 activity has emerged as important for neuronal viability and pathophysiology. The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, particularly within the Substantia nigra (SN), is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD), causing its motor symptoms. The activity-related Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis of SN DA neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic stress promote neurodegeneration and PD. In contrast, NCS-1 in general has neuroprotective effects. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed transcriptional changes in SN DA neurons upon NCS-1 loss by combining UV-laser microdissection and RT-qPCR-approaches to compare expression levels of a panel of PD and/or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-stress related genes from wildtype and NCS-1 KO mice. In NCS-1 KO, we detected significantly lower mRNA levels of mitochondrially coded ND1, a subunit of the respiratory chain, and of the neuron-specific enolase ENO2, a glycolytic enzyme. We also detected lower levels of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP4 and UCP5, the PARK7 gene product DJ-1, and the voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Cav2.3 in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO. Transcripts of other analyzed uncoupling proteins (UCPs), mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters, PARK genes, and ion channels were not altered. As Cav channels are linked to regulation of gene expression, metabolic stress and degeneration of SN DA neurons in PD, we analyzed Cav2.3 KO mice, to address if the transcriptional changes in NCS-1 KO were also present in Cav.2.3 KO, and thus probably correlated with lower Cav2.3 transcripts. However, in SN DA neurons from Cav2.3 KO mice, ND1 mRNA as well as genomic DNA levels were elevated, while ENO2, UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 transcript levels were not altered. In conclusion, our data indicate a possible novel function of NCS-1 in regulating gene transcription or stabilization of mRNAs in SN DA neurons. Although we do not provide functional data, our findings at the transcript level could point to impaired ATP production (lower ND1 and ENO2) and elevated metabolic stress (lower UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 levels) in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO mice. We speculate that NCS-1 is involved in stimulating ATP synthesis, while at the same time controlling mitochondrial metabolic stress, and in this way could protect SN DA neurons from degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Partial Least Squares Regression Performs Well in MRI-Based Individualized Estimations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estimation of individuals’ cognitive, behavioral and demographic (CBD) variables based on MRI has attracted much research interest in the past decade, and effective machine learning techniques are of great importance for these estimations. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is an attractive machine learning technique that can accommodate both single- and multi-label learning in a simple framework, while its potential for MRI-based estimations of CBD variables remains to be explored. In this study, we systemically investigated the performance of PLSR in MRI-based estimations of individuals’ CBD variables, especially its performance in simultaneous estimation of multiple CBD variables (multi-label learning). We performed the study on the dataset included in the HCP S1200 release. Resting state functional connections (RSFCs) were used as features, and a total of 10 CBD variables (e.g., age, gender, grip strength, and picture vocabulary) were estimated. The results showed that PLSR performed well in both single- and multi-label learning. In fact, the present estimations were better than those reported in literatures, as indicated by stronger correlations between the estimated and actual CBD variables, as well as high gender classification accuracy (97.8% in this study). Moreover, the RSFCs that contributed to the estimations exhibited strong correlations with the CBD variable estimated, that is, PLSR algorithm automatically selected the RSFCs closely related to one CBD variable to establish predictive models for the variable. Besides, the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs among 100, 200, and 300 regions of interest (ROIs) were higher than those based on RSFCs among 15, 25, and 50 ROIs; the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs evaluated using partial correlation were higher than those based on RSFCs evaluated using full correlation. In addition to the aforementioned virtues, PLSR is efficient in model training and testing, and it is simple and easy to use. Therefore, PLSR can be a favorable choice for future MRI-based estimations of CBD variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Influence of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Human Neurochemistry and Functional Connectivity: A Pilot MRI/MRS Study at 7 T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01260</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method commonly used in the disciplines of neuroscience, neurology, and neuropsychiatry to examine or modulate brain function. Low frequency rTMS (e.g., 1 Hz) is associated with a net suppression of cortical excitability, whereas higher frequencies (e.g., 5 Hz) purportedly increase excitability. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) allow investigation of neurochemistry and functional connectivity, respectively, and can assess the influence of rTMS in these domains. This pilot study investigated the effects of rTMS on the primary motor cortex using pre and post MRS and rsfMRI assessments at 7 T. Seven right-handed males (age 27 ± 7 y.o.) underwent single-voxel MRS and rsfMRI before and about 30-min after rTMS was administered outside the scanner for 20-min over the primary motor cortex of the left (dominant) hemisphere. All participants received 1-Hz rTMS; one participant additionally received 5-Hz rTMS in a separate session. Concentrations of 17 neurochemicals were quantified in left and right motor cortices. Connectivity metrics included fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) of both motor cortices, strength of related brain networks, and inter-hemispheric connectivity. The group-analysis revealed few trends (i.e., uncorrected for multiple comparisons), including a mean increase in the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) after the inhibitory rTMS protocol as compared to baseline in the stimulated (left) motor cortex (+8%, p = 0.043), along with a slight increase of total creatine (+2%, p = 0.018), and decrease of aspartate (−18%, p = 0.016). Additionally, GABA tended to decrease in the contralateral hemisphere (−6%, p = 0.033). No other changes of metabolite concentrations were found. Whereas functional connectivity outcomes did not exhibit trends of significant changes induced by rTMS, the percent changes of few connectivity metrics in both hemispheres were negatively correlated with GABA changes in the contralateral hemisphere. While studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, our results indicate the safety and feasibility of detecting changes in key metabolites associated with neurotransmission after a single 1-Hz rTMS session, establishing the construct for future exploration of the neurochemical, and connectivity mechanisms of cortical responses to neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Analysis of Decision-Making Process Using Methods of Quantitative Electroencephalography and Machine Learning Tools</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The electroencephalographic activity of particular brain areas during the decision making process is still little known. This paper presents results of experiments on the group of 30 patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders and 41 members of the control group. All subjects were performing the Iowa Gambling Task that is often used for decision process investigations. The electroencephalographical activity of participants was recorded using the dense array amplifier. The most frequently active Brodmann Areas were estimated by means of the photogrammetry techniques and source localization algorithms. The analysis was conducted in the full frequency as well as in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta bands. Next the mean electric charge flowing through each of the most frequently active areas and for each frequency band was calculated. The comparison of the results obtained for the subjects and the control groups is presented. The difference in activity of the selected Brodmann Areas can be observed in all variants of the task. The hyperactivity of amygdala is found in both the patients and the control group. It is noted that the somatosensory association cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and primary visual cortex play an important role in the decision-making process as well. Some of our results confirm the previous findings in the fMRI experiments. In addition, the results of the electroencephalographic analysis in the broadband as well as in specific frequency bands were used as inputs to several machine learning classifiers built in Azure Machine Learning environment. Comparison of classifiers' efficiency is presented to some extent and finding the most effective classifier may be important for planning research strategy toward finding decision-making biomarkers in cortical activity for both healthy people and those suffering from psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: ASD-DiagNet: A Hybrid Learning Approach for Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using fMRI Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00070</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods). The implemented code is available as GPL license on GitHub portal of our lab (https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-DiagNet).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Maintenance Versus Transmission Deficits: The Effect of Delay on Naming Performance in Aphasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00406</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00406</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose that deficits in lexical retrieval can involve difficulty in transmission of activation between processing levels, or difficulty in maintaining activation. In support, we present an investigation of picture naming by persons with aphasia in which the naming response is generated after a 1 s (sec) cue to respond in one condition or a 5 s cue to respond in another. Some individuals did better after 5 s, some did worse after 5 s, and some were not impacted by the delay. It is suggested that better performance after 5 s indicates a transmission deficit and that worse performance after 5 s indicates a maintenance deficit. To support this hypothesis, we adapted the two-step semantic-phonological model of lexical retrieval (Schwartz et al., 2006) so that it can simulate the passage of time and can simulate lesions in transmission (its semantic and phonological connection strength parameters) and/or maintenance (its decay parameter). The naming error patterns after 1 and 5 s for each participant were successfully fit to the model. Persons who did better after 5 s were found to have low connection strength parameters, persons who did worse after 5 s were simulated with an increased decay rate, and persons whose performance did not differ with delay were found to have lesions of both types. Some potential theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Temporal Structure in Haptic Signaling Under a Cooperative Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00372</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Haptic communication between humans plays an important role in society. Although this form of communication is ubiquitous at all levels of society and of human development, little is known about how synchronized coordination of motion between two persons leads to higher-order cognitive functions used in communication. In this study, we developed a novel experimental paradigm of a coin-collecting task in which participants used their hands to control a rod to jointly collect the coins on the screen. We characterized the haptic interactions between paired participants while they were taking part in a cooperative task. The individual participants first completed this task on their own and then with a randomly assigned partner for the cooperative task. Single participant experiments were used as a baseline to compare results of the paired participants. Forces applied to the rod were translated to four possible haptic states which encode the combination of the haptic interactions. As a next step, pairs of consecutive haptic states were then combined into 16 possible haptic signals which were classified in terms of their temporal patterns using a Tsallis q-exponential function. For paired participants, 80% of the haptic signals could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. On the other hand, only 30% of the signals found in the single-participant trials could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. This shows a clear difference in the temporal structures of haptic signals when participants are interacting with each other and when they are not. We also found a large difference in the number of haptic signals used by paired participants and singles. Single participants only used 1/4 of the possible haptic signals. Paired participants, on the other hand, used more than half of the possible signals. These results suggest that temporal structures present in haptic communication could be linked to the emergence of language at an evolutionary level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Laminar Organization of FM Direction Selectivity in the Primary Auditory Cortex of the Free-Tailed Bat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We studied the columnar and layer-specific response properties of neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of six (four females, two males) anesthetized free-tailed bats, Tadaridabrasiliensis, in response to pure tones and down and upward frequency modulated (FM; 50 kHz bandwidth) sweeps. In addition, we calculated current source density (CSD) to test whether lateral intracortical projections facilitate neuronal activation in response to FM echoes containing spectrally distant frequencies from the excitatory frequency response area (FRA). Auditory responses to a set of stimuli changing in frequency and level were recorded along 64 penetrations in the left A1 of six free-tailed bats. FRA shapes were consistent across the cortical depth within a column and there were no obvious differences in tuning properties. Generally, response latencies were shorter (&amp;lt;10 ms) for cortical depths between 500 and 600 μm, which might correspond to thalamocortical input layers IIIb–IV. Most units showed a stronger response to downward FM sweeps, and direction selectivity did not vary across cortical depth. CSD profiles calculated in response to the CF showed a current sink located at depths between 500 and 600 μm. Frequencies lower than the frequency range eliciting a spike response failed to evoke any visible current sink. Frequencies higher than the frequency range producing a spike response evoked layer IV sinks at longer latencies that increased with spectral distance. These data support the hypothesis that a progressive downward relay of spectral information spreads along the tonotopic axis of A1 via lateral connections, contributing to the neural processing of FM down sweeps used in biosonar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Internal Subdivisions of the Marmoset Claustrum Complex: Identification by Myeloarchitectural Features and High Field Strength Imaging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a surge of interest in the structure and function of the mammalian claustrum in recent years. However, most anatomical and physiological studies treat the claustrum as a relatively homogenous structure. Relatively little attention has been directed toward possible compartmentalization of the claustrum complex into anatomical subdivisions, and how this compartmentalization is reflected in claustrum connections with other brain structures. In this study, we examined the cyto- and myelo-architecture of the claustrum of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), to determine whether the claustrum contains internal anatomical structures or compartments, which could facilitate studies focused on understanding its role in brain function. NeuN, Nissl, calbindin, parvalbumin, and myelin-stained sections from eight adult marmosets were studied using light microscopy and serial reconstruction to identify potential internal compartments. Ultra high resolution (9.4T) post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging was employed to identify tractographic differences between identified claustrum subcompartments by diffusion-weighted tractography. Our results indicate that the classically defined marmoset claustrum includes at least two major subdivisions, which correspond to the dorsal endopiriform and insular claustrum nuclei, as described in other species, and that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEnD) contains architecturally distinct compartments. Furthermore, the dorsal subdivision of the DEnD is tractographically distinguishable from the insular claustrum with respect to cortical connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The insular cortex has been linked to a multitude of functions. In contrast, the nearby claustrum is a densely connected subcortical region with unclear function. To view the insula-claustrum region from the molecular perspective we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of these areas in six adult and four fetal human brains. We identified marker genes with specific expression and performed transcriptome-wide tests for enrichment of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. In addition, specific insular and claustral expression of genes pertaining to diseases, addiction, and depression was tested. At the anatomical level, we used brain-wide analyses to determine the specificity of our results and to determine the transcriptomic similarity of the insula-claustrum region. We found UCMA to be the most significantly enriched gene in the insular cortex and confirmed specific expression of NR4A2, NTNG2, and LXN in the claustrum. Furthermore, the insula was found to have enriched expression of genes associated with mood disorders, learning, cardiac muscle contraction, oxygen transport, glutamate and dopamine signaling. Specific expression in the claustrum was enriched for genes pertaining to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathy, intracellular transport, spine development, and macroautophagy. We tested for enrichment of genes related to addiction and depression, but they were generally not highly specific to the insula-claustrum region. Exceptions include high insular expression of genes linked to cocaine abuse and genes associated with ever smoking in the claustrum. Brain-wide, we find that markers of the adult claustrum are most specifically expressed in the fetal and adult insula. Altogether, our results provide a novel molecular perspective on the unique properties of the insula and claustrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: 25-OH Vitamin D Levels and Cognitive Performance: Longitudinal Assessment in a Healthy Aging Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00330</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00330</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Declining serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D, a biomarker of vitamin D status] with aging is a well-recognized phenomenon. However, scarce information is available on the relation between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive performance over time in older individuals. Our purpose was to evaluate, longitudinally, the association of 25(OH)D with cognitive function in a healthy older adults’ cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Sixty-four individuals over 55 years-old with no cognitive impairment, clustered as healthy “Poor” and “Good” cognitive performers, were followed for an average of 18 months. Seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D serum levels (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) were related, longitudinally, with cognitive (memory and general/executive) composite scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall seasonal-adjusted median serum 25(OH)D level was of 47 nmol/l [interquartile range (IQR), 38–60 nmol/l]. A negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D and the general/executive composite score was found in the “Poor” cognitive performers (r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; = −0.52, p = 0.006), an association lost after adjusting 25(OH)D levels for the season. No effect was found in both groups between seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D levels and the variation of both memory and general/executive composites during follow-up when adjusted for age, gender and education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In this healthy older population with no cognitive impairment, lower serum levels of 25(OH)D were not longitudinally associated with poorer cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of intracellular interactions in the collective polarization of tissues and its interplay with cellular geometry</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Shahriar Shadkhoo, Madhav Mani&lt;/p&gt;

Planar cell polarity (PCP), the long-range in-plane polarization of epithelial tissues, provides directional information that guides a multitude of developmental processes at cellular and tissue levels. While it is manifest that cells utilize both intracellular and intercellular interactions, the coupling between the two modules, essential to the coordination of collective polarization, remains an active area of investigation. We propose a generalized reaction-diffusion model to study the role of intracellular interactions in the emergence of long-range polarization, and show that the nonlocality of cytoplasmic interactions, i.e. coupling of membrane proteins localized on different cell-cell junctions, is of vital importance to the faithful detection of weak directional signals, and becomes increasingly more crucial to the stability of polarization against the deleterious effects of large geometric irregularities. We demonstrate that nonlocal interactions are necessary for geometric information to become accessible to the PCP components. The prediction of the model regarding polarization in elongated tissues, is shown to be in agreement with experimental observations, where the polarity emerges perpendicular to the axis of elongation. Core PCP is adopted as a model pathway, in term of which we interpret the model parameters. To this end, we introduce three distinct classes of mutations, (I) in membrane proteins, (II) in cytoplasmic proteins, and (III) local enhancement of geometric disorder. Comparing the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes, we show that our model successfully recapitulates the salient phenotypic features of these mutations. Exploring the parameter space helps us shed light on the role of cytoplasmic proteins in cell-cell communications, and make falsifiable predictions regarding the cooperation of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in the establishment of long-range polarization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dn6nYNWsqt8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze why numerous acute stroke treatments were successful in the laboratory but failed in large clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We searched all phase 3 trials of medical treatments for acute ischemic stroke and corresponding early clinical and experimental studies. We compared the overall efficacy and assessed the impact of publication bias and study design on the efficacy. Furthermore, we estimated power and true report probability of experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 50 phase 3 trials with 46,008 subjects, 75 early clinical trials with 12,391 subjects, and 209 experimental studies with &amp;gt;7,141 subjects. Three (6%) phase 3, 24 (32%) early clinical, and 143 (69.08%) experimental studies were positive. The mean treatment effect was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.83) in experimental studies, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.71–1.06) in early clinical trials, and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.95–1.06) in phase 3 trials. Funnel plot asymmetry and trim‐and‐fill revealed a clear publication bias in experimental studies and early clinical trials. Study design and adherence to quality criteria had a considerable impact on estimated effect sizes. The mean power of experimental studies was 17%. Assuming a bias of 30% and pre‐study odds of 0.5 to 0.7, this leads to a true report probability of &amp;lt;50%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pivotal study design differences between experimental studies and clinical trials, including different primary end points and time to treatment, publication bias, neglected quality criteria and low power, contribute to the stepwise efficacy decline of stroke treatments from experimental studies to phase 3 clinical trials. Even under conservative estimates, less than half of published positive experimental stroke studies are truly positive. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Newer Antiepileptic Drugs: A Randomized Trial for Dosage Adjustment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25641?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25641?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of TDM of newer generation AEDs in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing systematic with rescue TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the systematic TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the rescue TDM arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed 1 year without reaching one of the predefined endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic, and 53% in the rescue TDM arm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.6, Cox regression). There was no difference in terms of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding. However, TDM is useful in several situations, such as pregnancy, as well as when there are compliance issues. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Prior Direction Expectation on the Accuracy and Precision of Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The integration of sensory with top–down cognitive signals for generating appropriate sensory–motor behaviors is an important issue in understanding the brain’s information processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the interplay between sensory and high-level signals in oculomotor behavior could be explained by Bayesian inference. Specifically, prior knowledge for motion speed introduces a bias in the speed of smooth pursuit eye movements. The other important prediction of Bayesian inference is variability reduction by prior expectation; however, there is insufficient evidence in oculomotor behaviors to support this prediction. In the present study, we trained monkeys to switch the prior expectation about motion direction and independently controlled the strength of the motion stimulus. Under identical sensory stimulus conditions, we tested if prior knowledge about the motion direction reduced the variability of open-loop smooth pursuit eye movements. We observed a significant reduction when the prior expectation was strong; this was consistent with the prediction of Bayesian inference. Taking advantage of the open-loop smooth pursuit, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the effect of the prior to the pursuit direction bias and variability. This analysis demonstrated that the strength of the sensory evidence depended not only on the strength of the sensory stimulus but also on the time required for the pursuit system to form a neural sensory representation. Finally, we demonstrated that the variability and directional bias change by prior knowledge were quantitatively explained by the Bayesian observer model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Classification of Multiple Psychological Dimensions in Computer Game Players Using Physiology, Performance, and Personality Characteristics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human psychological (cognitive and affective) dimensions can be assessed using several methods, such as physiological or performance measurements. To date, however, few studies have compared different data modalities with regard to their ability to enable accurate classification of different psychological dimensions. This study thus compares classification accuracies for four psychological dimensions and two subjective preferences about computer game difficulty using three data modalities: physiology, performance, and personality characteristics. Thirty participants played a computer game at nine difficulty configurations that were implemented via two difficulty parameters. In each configuration, seven physiological measurements and two performance variables were recorded. A short questionnaire was filled out to assess the perceived difficulty, enjoyment, valence, arousal, and the way the participant would like to modify the two difficulty parameters. Furthermore, participants’ personality characteristics were assessed using four questionnaires. All combinations of the three data modalities (physiology, performance, and personality) were used to classify six dimensions of the short questionnaire into either two, three or many classes using four classifier types: linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), ensemble decision tree, and multiple linear regression. The classification accuracy varied widely between the different psychological dimensions; the highest accuracies for two-class and three-class classification were 97.6 and 84.1%, respectively. Normalized physiological measurements were the most informative data modality, though current game difficulty, personality and performance also contributed to classification accuracy; the best selected features are presented and discussed in the text. The SVM and multiple linear regression were the most accurate classifiers, with regression being more effective for normalized physiological data. In the future, we will further examine the effect of different classification approaches on user experience by detecting the user’s psychological state and adapting game difficulty in real-time. This will allow us to obtain a complete picture of the performance of affect-aware systems in both an offline (classification accuracy) and real-time (effect on user experience) fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Data-Driven Measure of Effective Connectivity Based on Renyi's α-Entropy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01277</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transfer entropy (TE) is a model-free effective connectivity measure based on information theory. It has been increasingly used in neuroscience because of its ability to detect unknown non-linear interactions, which makes it well suited for exploratory brain effective connectivity analyses. Like all information theoretic quantities, TE is defined regarding the probability distributions of the system under study, which in practice are unknown and must be estimated from data. Commonly used methods for TE estimation rely on a local approximation of the probability distributions from nearest neighbor distances, or on symbolization schemes that then allow the probabilities to be estimated from the symbols' relative frequencies. However, probability estimation is a challenging problem, and avoiding this intermediate step in TE computation is desirable. In this work, we propose a novel TE estimator using functionals defined on positive definite and infinitely divisible kernels matrices that approximate Renyi's entropy measures of order α. Our data-driven approach estimates TE directly from data, sidestepping the need for probability distribution estimation. Also, the proposed estimator encompasses the well-known definition of TE as a sum of Shannon entropies in the limiting case when α → 1. We tested our proposal on a simulation framework consisting of two linear models, based on autoregressive approaches and a linear coupling function, respectively, and on the public electroencephalogram (EEG) database BCI Competition IV, obtained under a motor imagery paradigm. For the synthetic data, the proposed kernel-based TE estimation method satisfactorily identifies the causal interactions present in the data. Also, it displays robustness to varying noise levels and data sizes, and to the presence of multiple interaction delays in the same connected network. Obtained results for the motor imagery task show that our approach codes discriminant spatiotemporal patterns for the left and right-hand motor imagination tasks, with classification performances that compare favorably to the state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain–computer interfaces (BCI) in motor imagery (MI) have developed rapidly in recent years. A reliable feature extraction method is essential because of a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time-dependent covariates of EEG signals. Because of efficient application in various fields, deep learning has been adopted in EEG signal processing and has obtained competitive results compared with the traditional methods. However, designing and training an end-to-end network to fully extract potential features from EEG signals remains a challenge in MI.&lt;/p&gt;Approach&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a parallel multiscale filter bank convolutional neural network (MSFBCNN) for MI classification. We introduce a layered end-to-end network structure, in which a feature-extraction network is used to extract temporal and spatial features. To enhance the transfer learning ability, we propose a network initialization and fine-tuning strategy to train an individual model for inter-subject classification on small datasets. We compare our MSFBCNN with the state-of-the-art approaches on open datasets.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The proposed method has a higher accuracy than the baselines in intra-subject classification. In addition, the transfer learning experiments indicate that our network can build an individual model and obtain acceptable results in inter-subject classification. The results suggest that the proposed network has superior performance, robustness, and transfer learning ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Correlation Between Muscle Structures and Electrical Properties of the Tibialis Anterior in Subacute Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01270</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01270</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that assesses the muscle inherent properties, whereas ultrasonography can assess the alteration in muscle architecture. This study aimed to combine EIM with ultrasonography to assess the changes of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle properties during passive plantar/dorsiflexion in stroke survivors. Fifteen patients with subacute stroke were recruited. The muscle structures were simultaneously assessed by EIM and ultrasonography at five different extension angles (−10°, 0°, 10°, 20°, and 30°) of the ankle joint. The EIM parameters measured were resistance (R), reactance (X), and phase angle (θ). The parameters recorded by ultrasonography were pennation angle (PA), muscle thickness (MT), and fascicle length (FL). Two-way repeated ANOVA was performed to compare the differences between the affected and unaffected sides as well as the parameters that changed with joint angle. Linear correlation analysis was conducted to assess the association between muscle parameters and clinical scores. The results showed that as the ankle was passively plantarflexed, the θ (P = 0.003) and PA (P &amp;lt; 0.001) values decreased, and the X (P &amp;lt; 0.001), R (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and FL (P &amp;lt; 0.001) values increased. Significant correlations were found between the FL and R values (r = 0.615, P = 0.015), MT and R values (r = 0.522, P = 0.046), and FL and θ values (r = 0.561, P = 0.03), as well as between the PA and the Fugl–Meyer Assessment of Lower Extremity score (r = 0.615, P = 0.015), the R and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score (r = 0.58, P = 0.023), and the PA and the manual muscle testing (MMT) score (r = −0.575, P = 0.025). This study demonstrated a correlation between the EIM and the ultrasonography parameters at different joint angles. Therefore, both methods could jointly be applied in patients with stroke to detect changes in the muscle inherent properties and muscle architecture. This could assist clinicians to quantitatively evaluate the muscle condition in people with subacute stroke. The study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (trial registration number: ChiCTR-IOR-17012299, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=19818).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration Number: ChiCTR-IOR-17012299.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Theta-Band Local Field Potential Oscillations Across Brain Networks With Central Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation to Enhance Spatial Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01269</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established technique for the treatment of movement and psychiatric disorders through the modulation of neural oscillatory activity and synaptic plasticity. The central thalamus (CT) has been indicated as a potential target for stimulation to enhance memory. However, the mechanisms underlying local field potential (LFP) oscillations and memory enhancement by CT-DBS remain unknown. In this study, we used CT-DBS to investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes in oscillatory communication between the CT and hippocampus, both of which are involved in spatial working memory. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from microelectrode array implanted in the CT, dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA) region 1, and CA region 3. Functional connectivity (FC) strength was assessed by LFP–LFP coherence calculations for these brain regions. In addition, a T-maze behavioral task using a rat model was performed to assess the performance of spatial working memory. In DBS group, our results revealed that theta oscillations significantly increased in the CT and hippocampus compared with that in sham controls. As indicated by coherence, the FC between the CT and hippocampus significantly increased in the theta band after CT-DBS. Moreover, Western blotting showed that the protein expressions of the dopamine D1 and α4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were enhanced, whereas that of the dopamine D2 receptor decreased in the DBS group. In conclusion, the use of CT-DBS resulted in elevated theta oscillations, increased FC between the CT and hippocampus, and altered synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, suggesting that CT-DBS is an effective approach for improving spatial working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Azithromycin Affords Neuroprotection in Rat Undergone Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01256</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repurposing existing drugs represents a promising approach for successful development of acute stroke therapies. In this context, the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has been shown to exert neuroprotection in mice due to its immunomodulatory properties. Here, we have demonstrated that acute administration of a single dose of azithromycin upon reperfusion produces a dose-dependent (ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.40 mg/kg; 95% CI = 0.48–4.03) reduction of ischemic brain damage measured 22 h after transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in adult male rats. Neuroprotection by azithromycin (150 mg/kg, i.p., upon reperfusion) was associated with a significant elevation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in astrocytes and neurons of the peri-ischemic motor cortex as detected after 2 and 22 h of reperfusion. By contrast, in the core region of the striatum, drug administration resulted in a dramatic elevation of STAT3 phosphorylation only after 22 h of reperfusion, being the signal mainly ascribed to infiltrating leukocytes displaying an M2 phenotype. These early molecular events were associated with a long-lasting neuroprotection, since a single dose of azithromycin reduced brain infarct damage and neurological deficit measured up to 7 days of reperfusion. These data, together with the evidence that azithromycin was effective in a clinically relevant time-window (i.e., when administered after 4.5 h of MCAo), provide robust preclinical evidence to support the importance of developing azithromycin as an effective acute therapy for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of Spatial Normalization Strategies on the Temporal Features of the Resting-State Functional MRI: Spatial Normalization Before rs-fMRI Features Calculation May Reduce the Reliability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01249</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01249</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies frequently applied the spatial normalization on fMRI time series before the calculation of temporal features (here referred to as “Prenorm”). We hypothesized that calculating the rs-fMRI features, for example, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in individual space, before the spatial normalization (referred to as “Postnorm”) can be an improvement to avoid artifacts and increase the results’ reliability. We utilized two datasets: (1) simulated images where temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is kept a constant and (2) an empirical fMRI dataset with 50 healthy young subjects. For simulated images, the tSNR is constant as generated in individual space but increased after Prenorm and intersubject variability of tSNR was induced. In contrast, tSNR was kept constant after Postnorm. Consistently, for empirical images, higher tSNR, ReHo, and FC (default mode network, seed in precuneus) and lower ALFF were found after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Coefficient of variability of tSNR and ALFF was higher after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Moreover, the significant correlation was found between simulated tSNR after Prenorm and empirical tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo after Prenorm, indicating algorithmic variation in empirical rs-fMRI features. Furthermore, comparing to Prenorm, ALFF and ReHo showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients between two serial scans after Postnorm. Our results indicated that Prenorm may induce algorithmic intersubject variability on tSNR and reduce its reliability, which also significantly affected ALFF and ReHo. We suggest using Postnorm instead of Prenorm for future rs-fMRI studies using ALFF/ReHo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several clinical trials address demyelinating diseases via transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Published reports detail that administration of MSCs in patients may provide a beneficial immunomodulation, and that factors secreted by MSCs are potent inducers of oligodendrogenesis. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used in life science and medicine as solvent, vehicle or cryoprotectant for cells used in transplantation. Importantly, most transplantation protocols do not include the removal of DMSO before injecting the cell suspension into patients. This indifferent application of DMSO is coming under increasing scrutiny following reports investigating its potential toxic side-effects. While the impact of DMSO on the central nervous system (CNS) has been partially studied, its effect on oligodendrocytes and oligodendrogenesis has not been addressed yet. Consequently, we evaluated the influence of DMSO on oligodendrogenesis, and on the pro-oligodendrogenic effect of MSCs’ secreted factors, using adult rat neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Here, we demonstrate that a concentration of 1% DMSO robustly suppressed oligodendrogenesis and drove the fate of differentiating NSPCs toward astrogenesis. Furthermore, the pro-oligodendrogenic effect of MSC-conditioned medium (MSCCM) was also nearly completely abolished by the presence of 1% DMSO. In this condition, inhibition of the Erk1/2 signal transduction pathway and high levels of Id2 expression, a specific inhibitor of oligodendrogenic differentiation, were detected. Furthermore, inflammatory demyelinating diseases may even potentiate the impact of DMSO on oligodendrogenesis. Our results demonstrate the imperative of considering the strong anti-oligodendrogenic activity of DMSO when designing future clinical trial protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Validation of the Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire: Maximum Duration of Immersive Virtual Reality Sessions Without the Presence of Pertinent Adverse Symptomatology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00417</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00417</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are major concerns about the suitability of immersive virtual reality (VR) systems (i.e., head-mounted display; HMD) to be implemented in research and clinical settings, because of the presence of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, and instability (i.e., VR induced symptoms and effects; VRISE). Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the presence and intensity of VRISE, but there are no suggestions regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The implementation of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and report both the quality of software features and VRISE intensity quantitatively. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire (VRNQ) was developed to assess the quality of VR software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty participants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study. They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions should be between 55 and 70 min when the VR software meets or exceeds the parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the VR system. Also, the gaming experience does not seem to affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially modulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion, better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity. The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs may appraise the suitability of VR software for implementation in research and clinical settings. The findings of this study contribute to the establishment of rigorous VR methods that are crucial for the viability of immersive VR as a research and clinical tool in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Action Observation and Effector Independency</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The finding of reasonably consistent spatial and temporal productions of actions across different body parts has been used to argue in favor of the existence of a high-order representation of motor programs. In these terms, a generalized motor program consists of an abstract memory structure apt to specify a class of non-specific instructions used to guide a broad range of movements (e.g., “grasp,” “bite”). Although a number of studies, using a variety of tasks, have assessed the issue of effector independence in terms of action execution, little is known regarding the issue of effector independence within an action observation context. Here corticospinal excitability (CSE) of the right hand’s first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles was assessed by means of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) during observation of a grasping action performed by the hand, the foot, the mouth, the elbow, or the knee. The results indicate that observing a grasping action performed with different body parts activates the effector typically adopted to execute that action, i.e., the hand. We contend that, as far as grasping is concerned, motor activations by action observation are evident in the muscles typically used to perform the observed action, even when the action is executed with another effector. Nevertheless, some exceptions call for a deeper analysis of motor coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: How Cortisol Reactivity Influences Prosocial Decision-Making: The Moderating Role of Sex and Empathic Concern</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00415</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fight and flight theory and the tend-and-befriend theory suggest two opposite behavioral stress responses, and heterogeneous research results revealed the importance of taking sex into account. The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of stress-related cortisol reactivity on subsequent prosocial decision-making behaviors, and the moderating role of sex and empathic concern (EC) in the process. Sixty-one healthy students (34 women, 27 men) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) or the control condition. Subsequently, participants completed three economic tasks—the dictator game, the ultimatum game, and the third-party compensation game. Statistical analyses revealed a significant main effect of cortisol reactivity on individuals’ third-party compensation behaviorssex. A sex-specific effect of stress-related cortisol change on prosocial behaviors was found, with men behaving more generously in the dictator game as stress-related cortisol reactivity increased. Furthermore, the level of EC was found to moderate the association between stress-related cortisol change and prosocial behaviors, that individuals with a low level of EC reported more generosity and third-party compensation behaviors. Overall, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the behavioral stress responses, that individuals whose hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are highly activated in response to stress would exhibit tend-and-befriend responses, but only among men and those with a low level of EC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Activity During Unilateral Physical and Imagined Isometric Contractions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00413</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00413</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;By convention, it is believed that the ipsilateral side of the body is controlled by the contralateral side of the brain. Past studies measuring brain activity primarily recorded changes before and after an intervention is performed on one side of the body within one hemisphere (usually the contralateral) of the brain. The purpose of this investigation was to observe the brain activity within the left and right hemispheres of the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices during physical and imagined, dominant and non-dominant unilateral isometric elbow flexion. Fifteen right hand dominant individuals (six males and nine females) between the ages of 18 and 21 performed four different isometric contractions of their biceps brachii at a preacher curl bench: dominant physical contraction (DomCon), non-dominant physical contraction (NonCon), dominant imagined contraction (DomImagine), and non-dominant imagined contraction (NonImagine). Each contraction was sustained for 5 s followed by 30 s of rest. Motor activity-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) within the right and left hemispheres of the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices were determined for each condition at 500–1,000 ms and 2,000–2,500 ms after initiation of contraction. MRCP and ERSP were both changed at the 500–1,000 ms time window for all conditions. Changes in the 2,000–2,500 ms window were most consistently observed during physical contractions. While the changes during DomCon occurred in the left (contralateral) side of the brain, the greatest changes observed in MRCP and ERSP occurred in both sides of the brain during the NonCon condition. Further understanding of bilateral changes in brain activity during unilateral tasks is valuable for improving rehabilitation practices through mental and physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Optimization of Real-Time EEG Artifact Removal and Emotion Estimation for Human-Robot Interaction Applications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Affective human-robot interaction requires lightweight software and cheap wearable devices that could further this field. However, the estimation of emotions in real-time poses a problem that has not yet been optimized. An optimization is proposed for the emotion estimation methodology including artifact removal, feature extraction, feature smoothing, and brain pattern classification. The challenge of filtering artifacts and extracting features, while reducing processing time and maintaining high accuracy results, is attempted in this work. First, two different approaches for real-time electro-oculographic artifact removal techniques are tested and compared in terms of loss of information and processing time. Second, an emotion estimation methodology is proposed based on a set of stable and meaningful features, a carefully chosen set of electrodes, and the smoothing of the feature space. The methodology has proved to perform on real-time constraints while maintaining high accuracy on emotion estimation on the SEED database, both under subject dependent and subject independent paradigms, to test the methodology on a discrete emotional model with three affective states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Visualization of Brain Activity in a Neuropathic Pain Model Using Quantitative Activity-Dependent Manganese Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00074</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00074</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brain imaging studies have revealed several regions that are activated in patients with chronic pain. In rodent brains, functional changes due to chronic pain have not been fully elucidated, as brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) require the use of anesthesia to suppress movement. Consequently, conclusions derived from existing imaging studies in rodents may not accurately reflect brain activity under awake conditions. In this study, we used quantitative activation-induced manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to directly capture the previous brain activity of awake mice. We also observed and quantified the brain activity of the spared nerve injury (SNI) neuropathic pain model during awake conditions. SNI-operated mice exhibited a robust decrease of mechanical nociceptive threshold 14 days after nerve injury. Imaging on SNI-operated mice revealed increased neural activity in the limbic system and secondary somatosensory, sensory-motor, piriform, and insular cortex. We present the first study demonstrating a direct measurement of awake neural activity in a neuropathic pain mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cell-type-specific expression of molecular tools and sensors is critical to construct circuit diagrams and to investigate the activity and function of neurons within the nervous system. Strategies for targeted manipulation include combinations of classical genetic tools such as Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT, use of cis-regulatory elements, targeted knock-in transgenic mice, and gene delivery by AAV and other viral vectors. The combination of these complex technologies with the goal of precise neuronal targeting is a challenge in the lab. This report will discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of combining current technologies and establish best practices for achieving targeted manipulation of specific cell types. Novel applications and tools, as well as areas for development, will be envisioned and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A novel network control model for identifying personalized driver genes in cancer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Feng Guo, Shao-Wu Zhang, Tao Zeng, Yan Li, Jianxi Gao, Luonan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Although existing computational models have identified many common driver genes, it remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes by using samples of an individual patient. Recently, the methods of exploiting the structure-based control principles of complex networks provide new clues for identifying minimum number of driver nodes to drive the state transition of large-scale complex networks from an initial state to the desired state. However, the structure-based network control methods cannot be directly applied to identify the personalized driver genes due to the unknown network dynamics of the personalized system. Here we proposed the personalized network control model (PNC) to identify the personalized driver genes by employing the structure-based network control principle on genetic data of individual patients. In PNC model, we firstly presented a paired single sample network construction method to construct the personalized state transition network for capturing the phenotype transitions between healthy and disease states. Then, we designed a novel structure-based network control method from the Feedback Vertex Sets-based control perspective to identify the personalized driver genes. The wide experimental results on 13 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas firstly showed that PNC model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, in terms of F-measures for identifying cancer driver genes enriched in the gold-standard cancer driver gene lists. Furthermore, these results showed that personalized driver genes can be explored by their network characteristics even when they are hidden factors in transcription and mutation profiles. Our PNC gives novel insights and useful tools into understanding the tumor heterogeneity in cancer.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Duration of American Football Play and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to contact and collision sports, including American football. We hypothesized a dose–response relationship between duration of football played and CTE risk and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a convenience sample of 266 deceased American football players from the Veterans Affairs–Boston University–Concussion Legacy Foundation and Framingham Heart Study Brain Banks, we estimated the association of years of football played with CTE pathological status and severity. We evaluated the ability of years played to classify CTE status using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Simulation analyses quantified conditions that might lead to selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 223 of 266 participants met neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE. More years of football played were associated with having CTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30 per year played, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19–1.41; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) and with CTE severity (severe vs mild; OR = 1.14 per year played, 95% CI = 1.07–1.22; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;). Participants with CTE were 1/10th as likely to have played &amp;lt;4.5 years (negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.100–0.105) and were 10 times as likely to have played &amp;gt;14.5 years (positive LR = 10.2, 95% CI = 9.8–10.7) compared with participants without CTE. Sensitivity and specificity were maximized at 11 years played. Simulation demonstrated that years played remained adversely associated with CTE status when years played and CTE status were both related to brain bank selection across widely ranging scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds of CTE double every 2.6 years of football played. After accounting for brain bank selection, the magnitude of the relationship between years played and CTE status remained consistent. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly variable. We aim to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes in MS, and to identify early prognostic features of these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred thirty‐two people presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome were prospectively recruited between 1984 and 1987, and followed up clinically and radiologically 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years later. All available notes and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed, and MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcome data were obtained in 120 participants at 30 years. Eighty were known to have developed MS by 30 years. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were available in 107 participants, of whom 77 had MS; 32 (42%) remained fully ambulatory (EDSS scores ≤3.5), all of whom had relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 3 (4%) had RRMS and EDSS scores &amp;gt;3.5, 26 (34%) had secondary progressive MS (all had EDSS scores &amp;gt;3.5), and MS contributed to death in 16 (20%). Of those with MS, 11 received disease‐modifying therapy. The strongest early predictors (within 5 years of presentation) of secondary progressive MS at 30 years were presence of baseline infratentorial lesions and deep white matter lesions at 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after onset, in a largely untreated cohort, there was a divergence of MS outcomes; some people accrued substantial disability early on, whereas others ran a more favorable long‐term course. These outcomes could, in part, be predicted by radiological findings from within 1 year of first presentation. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Layer‐ and Cell‐Specific Recruitment Dynamics during Epileptic Seizures In Vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25628?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the network dynamics mechanisms underlying differential initiation of epileptic interictal spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed combined in vivo 2‐photon calcium imaging from different targeted neuronal subpopulations and extracellular electrophysiological recordings during 4‐aminopyridine–induced neocortical spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both spikes and seizures were associated with intense synchronized activation of excitatory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and to a lesser degree layer 4 neurons, as well as inhibitory parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons (INs). In sharp contrast, layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs were gradually and asynchronously recruited into the ictal activity during the course of seizures. Within layer 2/3, the main difference between onset of spikes and seizures lay in the relative recruitment dynamics of excitatory PNs compared to parvalbumin‐ and somatostatin‐expressing inhibitory INs. Whereas spikes exhibited balanced recruitment of PNs and parvalbumin‐expressing INs, during seizures IN responses were reduced and less synchronized than in layer 2/3 PNs. Similar imbalance was not observed in layers 4 or 5 of the neocortex. Machine learning–based algorithms we developed were able to distinguish spikes from seizures based solely on activation dynamics of layer 2/3 PNs at discharge onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During onset of seizures, the recruitment dynamics markedly differed between neuronal subpopulations, with rapid synchronous recruitment of layer 2/3 PNs, layer 4 neurons, and parvalbumin‐expressing INs and gradual asynchronous recruitment of layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs. Seizures initiated in layer 2/3 due to a dynamic mismatch between local PNs and inhibitory INs, and only later spread to layer 5 by gradually and asynchronously recruiting PNs in this layer.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Analysis Pipeline for Extracting Features of Cortical Slow Oscillations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00070</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00070</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical slow oscillations (≲1 Hz) are an emergent property of the cortical network that integrate connectivity and physiological features. This rhythm, highly revealing of the characteristics of the underlying dynamics, is a hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and represents a default activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Wave Analysis Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way, allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects, or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical simulations. By using the SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites. Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral toward occipito-medial regions, further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results obtained using the SWAP will be essential for producing data-driven brain simulations. A spatial characterization of slow oscillations will also trigger a discussion on the role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Optimizing Optogenetic Activation of Purkinje Cell Axons to Investigate the Purkinje Cell – DCN Synapse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00031</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00031</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is a state-of-the-art tool for interrogating neural circuits. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells serve as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). To investigate the properties of this synaptic connection, we sought to elicit time-locked single action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. Using optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing Purkinje cells combined with patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices, we determine the photostimulation parameters required to elicit single time-locked action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. We show that axons require longer light pulses than somata do to elicit single action potentials and that Purkinje cell axons are also more susceptible to light perturbations. We then demonstrate that these empirically determined photostimulation parameters elicit time-locked synaptic currents from postsynaptic cells in the DCN. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing optogenetic stimulation conditions to interrogate synaptic connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early Actions of Neurotransmitters During Cortex Development and Maturation of Reprogrammed Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00033</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00033</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of the brain is shaped by a myriad of factors among which neurotransmitters play remarkable roles before and during the formation and maturation of synaptic circuits. Cellular processes such as neurogenesis, morphological development, synaptogenesis and maturation of synapses are temporary and spatially regulated by the local or distal influence of neurotransmitters in the developing cortex. Thus, research on this area has contributed to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of brain development and to shed light on the etiology of various human neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome (RTT), among others. Recently, the field of neuroscience has been shaken by an explosive advance of experimental approaches linked to the use of induced pluripotent stem cells and reprogrammed neurons. This new technology has allowed researchers for the first time to model in the lab the unique events that take place during early human brain development and to explore the mechanisms that cause synaptopathies. In this context, the role of neurotransmitters during early stages of cortex development is beginning to be re-evaluated and a revision of the state of the art has become necessary in a time when new protocols are being worked out to differentiate stem cells into functional neurons. New perspectives on reconsidering the function of neurotransmitters include opportunities for methodological advances, a better understanding of the origin of mental disorders and the potential for development of new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: sEMG-Based Trunk Compensation Detection in Rehabilitation Training</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01250</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01250</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke patients often use trunk to compensate for impaired upper limb motor function during upper limb rehabilitation training, which results in a reduced rehabilitation training effect. Detecting trunk compensations can improve the effect of rehabilitation training. This study investigates the feasibility of a surface electromyography-based trunk compensation detection (sEMG-bTCD) method. Five healthy subjects and nine stroke subjects with cognitive and comprehension skills were recruited to participate in the experiments. The sEMG signals from nine superficial trunk muscles were collected during three rehabilitation training tasks (reach-forward-back, reach-side-to-side, and reach-up-to-down motions) without compensation and with three common trunk compensations [lean-forward (LF), trunk rotation (TR), and shoulder elevation (SE)]. Preprocessing like filtering, active segment detection was performed and five time domain features (root mean square, variance, mean absolute value (MAV), waveform length, and the fourth order autoregressive model coefficient) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals. Excellent TCD performance was achieved in healthy participants by using support vector machine (SVM) classifier (LF: accuracy = 94.0%, AUC = 0.97, F1 = 0.94; TR: accuracy = 95.8%, AUC = 0.99, F1 = 0.96; SE: accuracy = 100.0%, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00). By using SVM classifier, TCD performance in stroke participants was also obtained (LF: accuracy = 74.8%, AUC = 0.90, F1 = 0.73; TR: accuracy = 67.1%, AUC = 0.85, F1 = 0.71; SE: accuracy = 91.3%, AUC = 0.98, F1 = 0.90). Compared with the methods based on cameras or inertial sensors, better detection performance was obtained in both healthy and stroke participants. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the sEMG-bTCD method, and it helps to prompt the stroke patients to correct their incorrect posture, thereby improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Considerations for Measuring Activity-Dependence of Recruitment of Synaptic Vesicles to the Readily Releasable Pool</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00032</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00032</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The connection strength of most chemical synapses changes dynamically during normal use as a function of the recent history of activity. The phenomenon is known as short-term synaptic plasticity or synaptic dynamics, and is thought to be involved in processing and filtering information as it is transmitted across the synaptic cleft. Multiple presynaptic mechanisms have been implicated, but large gaps remain in our understanding of how the mechanisms are modulated and how they interact. One important factor is the timing of recruitment of synaptic vesicles to a readily-releasable pool. A number of studies have concluded that activity and/or residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can accelerate the mechanism, but alternative explanations for some of the evidence have emerged. Here I review the methodology that we have developed for isolating the recruitment and the dependence on activity from other kinds of mechanisms that are activated concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer’s loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70–0.99; DSC = 0.84–0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82–0.99) than lesional OR (0.70–0.99). The non-lesional OR’s mean volume was 22.66 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; the mean Meyer’s loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (± 1.00–3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Seemingly, a paradox exists between reports of wide-scale task-dependent cortical activity and the causal requirement for only a restricted number of motor and sensory cortical areas in some behavioral studies. In this issue of Neuron, Pinto et al. (2019) indicate that scenarios where mice must accumulate evidence and hold it during a delay period are causally linked to wide regions of cortex.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Optimized Configuration of Functional Brain Network for Processing Semantic Audiovisual Stimuli Underlying the Modulation of Attention: A Graph-Based Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00067</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Semantic audiovisual stimuli have a facilitatory effect on behavioral performance and influence the integration of multisensory inputs across sensory modalities. Many neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies investigated the neural mechanisms of multisensory semantic processing and reported that attention modulates the response to multisensory semantic inputs. In the present study, we designed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment of semantic discrimination using the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli with semantic information. By manipulating the stimuli present on attended and unattended position, we recorded the task-related fMRI data corresponding to the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions. We also recorded the fMRI data in resting state. Then the fMRI method was used together with a graph theoretical analysis to construct the functional brain networks in task-related and resting states and quantitatively characterize the topological network properties. The aim of our present study is to explore the characteristics of functional brain networks that process semantic audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions, revealing the neural mechanism of multisensory processing and the modulation of attention. The behavioral results showed that the audiovisual stimulus presented simultaneously promoted the performance of semantic discrimination task. And the analyses of network properties showed that compared with the resting-state condition, the functional networks of processing semantic audiovisual stimuli (both in attended and unattended conditions) had greater small-worldness, global efficiency, and lower clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency and hierarchy. In addition, the hubs were concentrated in the bilateral temporal lobes, especially in the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs), which were positively correlated to reaction time (RT). Moreover, attention significantly altered the degree of small-worldness and the distribution of hubs in the functional network for processing semantic audiovisual stimuli. Our findings suggest that the topological structure of the functional brain network for processing semantic audiovisual stimulus is modulated by attention, and has the characteristics of high efficiency and low wiring cost, which maintains an optimized balance between functional segregation and integration for multisensory processing efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pre-emptive Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder: Theoretical Foundations and Clinical Translation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00066</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00066</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are an emergent public health problem, placing significant burden upon the individual, family and health system. ASD are polygenetic spectrum disorders of neural connectome development, in which one or more feedback loops amplify small genetic, structural, or functional variations in the very early development of motor and sensory-motor pathways. These perturbations trigger a ‘butterfly effect’ of unpredictable cascades of structural and functional imbalances in the global neuronal workspace, resulting in atypical behaviors, social communication, and cognition long-term. The first 100 days post-term are critically neuroplastic and comprise an injury-sensitive developmental window, characterized by a neural biomarker, the persistence of the cortical subplate, and a behavioral biomarker, the crying diathesis. By the time potential diagnostic signs are identified, from 6 months of age, ASD neuropathy is already entrenched. The International Society for Autism Research Special Interest Group has called for pre-emptive intervention, based upon rigorous theoretical frames, and real world translation and evaluation. This paper responds to that call. It synthesizes heterogenous evidence concerning ASD etiologies from both psychosocial and biological research literatures with complexity science and evolutionary biology, to propose a theoretical framework for pre-emptive intervention. This paper hypothesizes that environmental factors resulting from a mismatch between environment of evolutionary adaptedness and culture initiate or perpetuate early motor and sensory-motor lesions, triggering a butterfly effect of multi-directional cascades of atypical developmental in the complex adaptive system of the parent and ASD-susceptible infant. Chronic sympathetic nervous system/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperarousal and disrupted parent-infant biobehavioral synchrony are the key biologic and behavioral mechanisms perpetuating these atypical developmental cascades. A clinical translation of this evidence is proposed, for application antenatally and in the first 6 months of life, as pre-emptive intervention for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Mediates Autophagy Flux in Human Bone Mesenchymal Stromal Cells via NMDA Receptor–Ca2+–Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase–Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling</title>

	<description>Aim&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive and safe technique for treatment of central and peripheral nerve injury. In recent years, this technique has been widely used in clinic, and an increasing number of studies have reported its mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of rTMS-mediated autophagy flux in human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A frequency of 50 Hz was employed. Cells were divided into five groups: (1) normal, (2) sham, (3) 0.5 T, (4) 1.0 T, and (5) 1.5 T. Cells were stimulated for 20 min/day. The levels of p62, LC3-II/I, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), ERK, phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT), AKT, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), mTOR, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA), PKA, phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), EGFR, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and NMDA receptor (NMDAR1) were investigated by western blotting. Intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) levels were quantified by flow cytometry. p62 and LC3 expression was also assessed by immunofluorescence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the 0.5 T group, rTMS increased the expression of LC3-II/I, p-ERK/ERK, and NMDAR1 and decreased the levels of p62 and p-mTOR/mTOR than in the normal group. The ratio of p-AKT/AKT, p-PKA/PKA, and p-EGFR/EGFR and the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of p62 with LC3 puncta, and flow cytometry analysis displayed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were elevated. However, in the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, no changes in the expression of these autophagy markers were observed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In the 0.5 T group, high-frequency rTMS can induce autophagy through NMDAR–Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;–ERK–mTOR signaling in BMSCs. In the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, autophagy is not activated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Optogenetic/Chemogenetic Activation of GABAergic Neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area Facilitates General Anesthesia via Projections to the Lateral Hypothalamus in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00073</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) reportedly regulates sleep and wakefulness through communication with the lateral hypothalamus (LH). It has also been suggested that adequate anesthesia produced by administration of chloral hydrate, ketamine, or halothane significantly reduces the GABAergic neuronal firing rate within the VTA. However, the exact effects on GABAergic neurons in the VTA and the mechanisms through which these neurons modulate anesthesia through associated neural circuits is still unclear. Here, we used optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to specifically activate or inhibit GABAergic neuronal perikarya in the VTA or their projections to the LH in Vgat-Cre mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analyses and burst suppression ratio (BSR) calculations were conducted following administration of 0.8 or 1.0% isoflurane, respectively; and loss of righting reflex (LORR), recovery of righting reflex (RORR), and anesthesia sensitivity were assessed under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA increased delta wave power from 40.0 to 46.4% (P = 0.006) and decreased gamma wave power from 15.2 to 11.5% (P = 0.017) during anesthesia maintenance. BSR was increased from 51.8 to 68.3% (P = 0.017). Induction time (LORR) was reduced from 333 to 290 s (P = 0.019), whereas arousal time (RORR) was prolonged from 498 to 661 s (P = 0.007). Conversely, inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons led to opposite effects. In contrast, optical activation of VTA–LH GABAergic projection neurons increased power of slow delta waves from 44.2 to 48.8% (P = 0.014) and decreased that of gamma oscillations from 10.2 to 8.0%. BSR was increased from 39.9 to 60.2% (P = 0.0002). LORR was reduced from 330 to 232 s (P = 0.002), and RORR increased from 396 to 565 s (P = 0.007). Optical inhibition of the projection neurons caused opposite effects in terms of both the EEG spectrum and the BSR, except that inhibition of this projection did not accelerate arousal time. These results indicate that VTA GABAergic neurons could facilitate the anesthetic effects of isoflurane during induction and maintenance while postponing anesthetic recovery, at least partially, through modulation of their projections to the LH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;T helper 17 (Th17) cells represent a distinct population of immune cells, important in the defense of the organism against extracellular infectious agents. Because of their cytokine profile and ability to recruit other immune cell types, they are highly pro-inflammatory and are involved in the induction of several autoimmune disorders. Recent studies show that Th17 cells and their signature cytokine IL-17 have also a role in a wide variety of neurological diseases. This review article will briefly summarize the evidence linking Th17 cells to brain diseases associated with cognitive impairment, including multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will also investigate the mechanisms by which these cells enter the brain and induce brain damage, including direct effects of IL-17 on brain cells and indirect effects mediated through disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neurovascular dysfunction and gut-brain axis. Finally, therapeutic prospects targeting Th17 cells and IL-17 will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals undergo torpor periods characterized by a general decrease in body temperature, metabolic rate, and brain activity accompanied by complex adaptive brain changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme conditions of hypoxia and low temperatures. These processes are accompanied by morphological and neurochemical changes in the brain including those in cortical neurons such as the fragmentation and reduction of the Golgi apparatus (GA), which both reverse a few hours after arousal from the torpor state. In the present study, we characterized – by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy – the GA of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in the Syrian hamster, which is a facultative hibernator. We also show that after artificial induction of hibernation, in addition to neurons, the GA of glia in the Syrian hamster undergoes important structural changes, as well as modifications in the intensity of immunostaining and distribution patterns of Golgi structural proteins at different stages of the hibernation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Effect on Hippocampal Synaptic Facilitation by the Presynaptic Protein Mover</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00030</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release relies on an evolutionarily conserved presynaptic machinery. Nonetheless, some proteins occur in certain species and synapses, and are absent in others, indicating that they may have modulatory roles. How such proteins expand the power or versatility of the core release machinery is unclear. The presynaptic protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 is heterogeneously expressed among synapses of the rodent brain, suggesting that it may add special functions to subtypes of presynaptic terminals. Mover is a synaptic vesicle-attached phosphoprotein that binds to Calmodulin and the active zone scaffolding protein Bassoon. Here we use a Mover knockout mouse line to investigate the role of Mover in the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse and Schaffer collateral to CA1. While Schaffer collateral synapses were unchanged by the knockout, the MFs showed strongly increased facilitation. The effect of Mover knockout in facilitation was both calcium- and age-dependent, having a stronger effect at higher calcium concentrations and in younger animals. Increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by forskolin equally potentiated both wildtype and knockout MF synapses, but occluded the increased facilitation observed in the knockout. These discoveries suggest that Mover has distinct roles at different synapses. At MF terminals, it acts to constrain the extent of presynaptic facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Upper-Limb Motor Performance in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has previously been reported to improve facets of upper limb motor performance such as accuracy and strength. However, the magnitude of motor performance improvement has not been reviewed by contemporaneous systematic review or meta-analysis of sham vs. active tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyse the existing evidence regarding the benefits of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted to obtain relevant articles from three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) yielding 3,200 abstracts. Following independent assessment by two reviewers, a total of 86 articles were included for review, of which 37 were deemed suitable for meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Meta-analyses were performed for four outcome measures, namely: reaction time (RT), execution time (ET), time to task failure (TTF), and force. Further qualitative review was performed for accuracy and error. Statistically significant improvements in RT (effect size −0.01; 95% CI −0.02 to 0.001, p = 0.03) and ET (effect size −0.03; 95% CI −0.05 to −0.01, p = 0.017) were demonstrated compared to sham. In exercise tasks, increased force (effect size 0.10; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.13, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and a trend towards improved TTF was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence attesting to the impact of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults. Improved performance is demonstrable in reaction time, task completion time, elbow flexion tasks and accuracy. Considerable heterogeneity exists amongst the literature, further confirming the need for a standardised approach to reporting tDCS studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Deep Feature Selection and Causal Analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success for image classification in medical research. Deep learning with brain imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are “black boxes” owing to their low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The algorithm identified brain regions underlying AD consisting of the temporal lobes (including the hippocampus) and the ventricular system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Enabling Large-Scale Simulations With the GENESIS Neuronal Simulator</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we evaluate the computational performance of the GEneral NEural SImulation System (GENESIS) for large scale simulations of neural networks. While many benchmark studies have been performed for large scale simulations with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons or neuronal models with only a few compartments, this work focuses on higher fidelity neuronal models represented by 50–74 compartments per neuron. After making some modifications to the source code for GENESIS and its parallel implementation, PGENESIS, particularly to improve memory usage, we find that PGENESIS is able to efficiently scale on supercomputing resources to network sizes as large as 9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons with 18 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; synapses and 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons with 45 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; synapses. The modifications to GENESIS that enabled these large scale simulations have been incorporated into the May 2019 Official Release of PGENESIS 2.4 available for download from the GENESIS web site (genesis-sim.org).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
