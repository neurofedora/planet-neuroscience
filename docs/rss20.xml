	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spiking Neural Networks modelled as Timed Automata with parameter learning. (arXiv:1808.01893v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01893</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01893</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a novel approach to automatically infer parameters
of spiking neural networks. Neurons are modelled as timed automata waiting for
inputs on a number of different channels (synapses), for a given amount of time
(the accumulation period). When this period is over, the current potential
value is computed considering current and past inputs. If this potential
overcomes a given threshold, the automaton emits a broadcast signal over its
output channel , otherwise it restarts another accumulation period. After each
emission, the automaton remains inactive for a fixed refractory period. Spiking
neural networks are formalised as sets of automata, one for each neuron,
running in parallel and sharing channels according to the network structure.
Such a model is formally validated against some crucial properties defined via
proper temporal logic formulae. The model is then exploited to find an
assignment for the synaptical weights of neural networks such that they can
reproduce a given behaviour. The core of this approach consists in identifying
some correcting actions adjusting synaptical weights and back-propagating them
until the expected behaviour is displayed. A concrete case study is discussed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Out of sight out of mind: Perceived physical distance between the observer and someone in pain shapes observer's neural empathic reactions. (arXiv:1808.01805v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social and affective relations may shape empathy to others' affective states.
Previous studies also revealed that people tend to form very different mental
representations of stimuli on the basis of their physical distance. In this
regard, embodied cognition proposes that different physical distances between
individuals activate different interpersonal processing modes, such that close
physical distance tends to activate the interpersonal processing mode typical
of socially and affectively close relationships. In Experiment 1, two groups of
participants were administered a pain decision task involving upright and
inverted face stimuli painfully or neutrally stimulated, and we monitored their
neural empathic reactions by means of event-related potentials (ERPs)
technique. Crucially, participants were presented with face stimuli of one of
two possible sizes in order to manipulate retinal size and perceived physical
distance, roughly corresponding to the close and far portions of social
distance. ERPs modulations compatible with an empathic reaction were observed
only for the group exposed to face stimuli appearing to be at a close social
distance from the participants. This reaction was absent in the group exposed
to smaller stimuli corresponding to face stimuli observed from a far social
distance. In Experiment 2, one different group of participants was engaged in a
match-to-sample task involving the two-size upright face stimuli of Experiment
1 to test whether the modulation of neural empathic reaction observed in
Experiment 1 could be ascribable to differences in the ability to identify
faces of the two different sizes. Results suggested that face stimuli of the
two sizes could be equally identifiable. In line with the Construal Level and
Embodied Simulation theoretical frameworks, we conclude that perceived physical
distance may shape empathy as well as social and affective distance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-Objective Cognitive Model: a supervised approach for multi-subject fMRI analysis. (arXiv:1808.01642v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01642</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01642</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to decode the human brain, Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification
generates cognitive models by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) datasets. As a standard pipeline in the MVP analysis, brain patterns in
multi-subject fMRI dataset must be mapped to a shared space and then a
classification model is generated by employing the mapped patterns. However,
the MVP models may not provide stable performance on a new fMRI dataset because
the standard pipeline uses disjoint steps for generating these models. Indeed,
each step in the pipeline includes an objective function with independent
optimization approach, where the best solution of each step may not be optimum
for the next steps. For tackling the mentioned issue, this paper introduces the
Multi-Objective Cognitive Model (MOCM) that utilizes an integrated objective
function for MVP analysis rather than just using those disjoint steps. For
solving the integrated problem, we proposed a customized multi-objective
optimization approach, where all possible solutions are firstly generated, and
then our method ranks and selects the robust solutions as the final results.
Empirical studies confirm that the proposed method can generate superior
performance in comparison with other techniques.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Colour for behavioural success. (arXiv:1808.01612v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01612</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01612</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Colour information not only helps sustain the survival of animal species by
guiding sexual selection and foraging behaviour, but also is an important
factor in the cultural and technological development of our own species. This
is illustrated by examples from the visual arts and from state-of-the-art
imaging technology, where the strategic use of colour has become a powerful
tool for guiding the planning and execution of interventional procedures. The
functional role of colour information in terms of its potential benefits to
behavioural success across the species is addressed in the introduction here to
clarify why colour perception may have evolved to generate behavioural success.
It is argued that evolutionary and environmental pressures influence not only
colour trait production in the different species, but also their ability to
process and exploit colour information for goal-specific purposes. We then leap
straight to the human primate with insight from current research on the
facilitating role of colour cues on performance training with precision
technology for image-guided surgical planning and intervention. It is shown
that local colour cues in 2D images generated by a surgical fisheye camera help
individuals become more precise rapidly across a limited number of trial sets
in simulator training for specific manual gestures with a tool. The
progressively facilitating effect of a local colour cue on performance
evolution in a video controlled simulator task can be explained in terms of
colour-based figure-ground segregation guiding attention towards local image
parts, with an immediate cost on performance time, and a lasting long-term
benefit in terms of greater task precision.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic self-organized error-correction of grid cells by border cells. (arXiv:1808.01503v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01503</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01503</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are believed to establish their regular,
spatially correlated firing patterns by path integration of the animal's
motion. Mechanisms for path integration, e.g. in attractor network models,
predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed
experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic
self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental
boundaries, can correct such drift in grid cells. In our model,
experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells
to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset
the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to
environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior
barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation
experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal
cortex could interact dynamically and adaptively to achieve robust path
integration.

Developmental patterning mechanisms are critical to ensuring concordance between dendritic form and function. This article reviews recent studies in vertebrate retina and brain that elucidate key strategies for dendrite functional maturation. Specific cellular and molecular signals control the initiation and elaboration of dendritic arbors, and facilitate integration of young neurons into particular circuits. In some cells, dendrite growth and remodeling continues into adulthood. Once formed, dendrites subdivide into compartments with distinct physiological properties that enable dendritic computations. Understanding these key stages of dendrite patterning will help reveal how circuit functional properties arise during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tianwei Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic correlations are pervasive in high-throughput data. Large numbers of gene pairs can change their correlation patterns in response to observed/unobserved changes in physiological states. Finding changes in correlation patterns can reveal important regulatory mechanisms. Currently there is no method that can effectively detect global dynamic correlation patterns in a dataset. Given the challenging nature of the problem, the currently available methods use genes as surrogate measurements of physiological states, which cannot faithfully represent true underlying biological signals. In this study we develop a new method that directly identifies strong latent dynamic correlation signals from the data matrix, named DCA: Dynamic Correlation Analysis. At the center of the method is a new metric for the identification of pairs of variables that are highly likely to be dynamically correlated, without knowing the underlying physiological states that govern the dynamic correlation. We validate the performance of the method with extensive simulations. We applied the method to three real datasets: a single cell RNA-seq dataset, a bulk RNA-seq dataset, and a microarray gene expression dataset. In all three datasets, the method reveals novel latent factors with clear biological meaning, bringing new insights into the data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PtZYXnfwjiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0207-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely-timed coordination between sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine if by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10-minute trials of beam-walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time-frequency fluctuations in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared to pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual vs. physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We performed the first EEG time-frequency analysis on source-localized human electrocortical responses to physical and visual balance perturbations during both walking and standing. Perturbations elicited similar time-frequency patterns, but in notably different cortical areas for physical versus visual perturbations. Perturbation-evoked EEG fluctuations localized primarily to occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and motor areas during physical perturbations. These similarities suggest a common electrocortical response to sensorimotor perturbations. Notably, standing had greater electrocortical responses than walking. The results from this study may have applications in assessing and assisting treatment of balance dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Built to Last: Functional and structural mechanisms in the moth olfactory network mitigate effects of neural injury. (arXiv:1808.01279v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01279</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01279</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most organisms are exposed to neural damage throughout their lives, which can
reduce their ability to carry out core behavioral tasks. Their neural circuits
need to maintain functionality despite injury, which often requires that key
readout signals from the system be preserved. In this work, we explore whether
and how certain structural and functional network motifs act as injury
mitigation mechanisms by protecting these readouts. Specifically, we examine
how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise, and (iii) presence of
parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to robustness of the
olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simulate injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory
network in which structures-under-test are parametrically varied. Neuronal
impairments are modeled as focal axonal swellings, an axonal pathology observed
across all severities of traumatic brain injuries and present in other leading
brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon and consequently reduce the effective neural firing
rate delivered to downstream neurons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of the network motifs examined significantly mitigate the effects
of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's impact on readout
neuron responses or by restoring these responses to pre-injury levels through
reinforcement learning. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their
value as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural
injury. More generally, these experiments suggest that robustness to injury is
a vital design principle to consider when analyzing biological neural systems.
Indeed, it is possible that some neural structures and mechanisms, including
the ability to learn, are best understood as evolutionary solutions to the
challenge of maintaining system function despite injury.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cortical Microcircuits from a Generative Vision Model. (arXiv:1808.01058v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the information processing roles of cortical circuits is an
outstanding problem in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The
theoretical setting of Bayesian inference has been suggested as a framework for
understanding cortical computation. Based on a recently published generative
model for visual inference (George et al., 2017), we derive a family of
anatomically instantiated and functional cortical circuit models. In contrast
to simplistic models of Bayesian inference, the underlying generative model's
representational choices are validated with real-world tasks that required
efficient inference and strong generalization. The cortical circuit model is
derived by systematically comparing the computational requirements of this
model with known anatomical constraints. The derived model suggests precise
functional roles for the feedforward, feedback and lateral connections observed
in different laminae and columns, and assigns a computational role for the path
through the thalamus.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Mitotic progression, arrest, exit or death relies on centromere structural integrity, rather than de novo transcription</title>

	<description>Recent studies have challenged the prevailing dogma that transcription is repressed during mitosis. Transcription was also proposed to sustain a robust spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) response. Here we used live-cell imaging of human cells, RNA-seq and qPCR to investigate the requirement for de novo transcription during mitosis. Under conditions of persistently unattached kinetochores, transcription inhibition with actinomycin D, or treatment with other DNA-intercalating drugs, delocalized the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) protein Aurora B from centromeres, compromising SAC signalling and cell fate. However, we were unable to detect significant changes in mitotic transcript levels. Moreover, inhibition of transcription independently of DNA intercalation had no effect on Aurora B centromeric localization, SAC response, mitotic progression, exit or death. Mechanistically, we show that DNA intercalating agents reduce the interaction of the CPC with nucleosomes. Thus, mitotic progression, arrest, exit or death is determined by centromere structural integrity, rather than de novo transcription.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Insights into centriole geometry revealed by cryoTomography of doublet and triplet centrioles</title>

	<description>Centrioles are cylindrical assemblies comprised of 9 singlet, doublet, or triplet microtubules, essential for the formation of motile and sensory cilia. While the structure of the cilium is being defined at increasing resolution, centriolar structure remains poorly understood. Here, we used electron cryo-tomography to determine the structure of mammalian (triplet) and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; (doublet) centrioles. Mammalian centrioles have two distinct domains: a 200 nm proximal core region connected by A-C linkers, and a distal domain where the C-tubule is incomplete and a pair of novel linkages stabilize the assembly producing a geometry more closely resembling the ciliary axoneme. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; centrioles resemble the mammalian core, but with their doublet microtubules linked through the A tubules. The commonality of core-region length, and the abrupt transition in mammalian centrioles, suggests a conserved length-setting mechanism. The unexpected linker diversity suggests how unique centriolar architectures arise in different tissues and organisms.</description>

	<description>Planar cell polarity (PCP) controls convergent extension and axis elongation in all vertebrates. Though asymmetric localization of PCP proteins is central to their function, we understand little about PCP protein localization during convergent extension. Here, we use quantitative live imaging to simultaneously monitor cell intercalation behaviors and PCP protein dynamics in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; neural plate epithelium. We observed asymmetric enrichment of PCP proteins, but more interestingly, we observed tight correlation of PCP protein enrichment with actomyosin-driven contractile behavior of cell-cell junctions. Moreover, we found that the turnover rates of junctional PCP proteins also correlated with the contractile behavior of individual junctions. All of these dynamic relationships were disrupted when PCP signaling was manipulated. Together, these results provide a dynamic and quantitative view of PCP protein localization during convergent extension and suggest a complex and intimate link between the dynamic localization of core PCP proteins, actomyosin assembly, and polarized junction shrinking during cell intercalation in the closing vertebrate neural tube.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35720</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35720</link>
	<description>ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins represent a diverse family of proteins that share ATPase domains that are adapted to regulate protein-DNA interactions. Here we present structures of the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; Chd1 protein engaged with nucleosomes in the presence of the transition state mimic ADP-beryllium fluoride. The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA. This indicates how changes to nucleosome structure can alter the way in which histone epitopes are presented.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Estrogenic-dependent glutamatergic neurotransmission from kisspeptin neurons governs feeding circuits in females</title>

	<description>The neuropeptides tachykinin2 (Tac2) and kisspeptin (Kiss1) in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus Kiss1 (Kiss1&lt;sup&gt;ARH&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons are essential for pulsatile release of GnRH and reproduction. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) decreases &lt;i&gt;Kiss1 and Tac2 &lt;/i&gt;mRNA expression in Kiss1&lt;sup&gt;ARH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, the role of Kiss1&lt;sup&gt;ARH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons during E2-driven anorexigenic states and their coordination of POMC and NPY/AgRP feeding circuits have been largely ignored. Presently, we show that E2 augmented the excitability of Kiss1&lt;sup&gt;ARH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons by amplifying &lt;i&gt;Cacna1g, Hcn1 and Hcn2 &lt;/i&gt;mRNA expression and T-type calcium and h-currents. E2&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;increased &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and glutamatergic synaptic input to arcuate neurons, which excited POMC and inhibited NPY/AgRP neurons via metabotropic receptors. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt; in Kiss1 neurons eliminated glutamate release and led to conditioned place preference for sucrose in E2-treated KO female mice. Therefore, the E2-driven increase in Kiss1 neuronal excitability and glutamate neurotransmission may play a key role in governing the motivational drive for palatable food in females.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epigenetic changes have likely contributed to the large size and enhanced cognitive abilities of the human brain which evolved within the last 2 million years after the human–chimpanzee split. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we have compared the methylomes of neuronal and non-neuronal cells from 3 human and 3 chimpanzee cortices. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with genome-wide significance were enriched in specific genomic regions. Intraspecific methylation differences between neuronal and non-neuronal cells were approximately 3 times more abundant than interspecific methylation differences between human and chimpanzee cell types. The vast majority (&amp;gt;90%) of human intraspecific DMRs (including DMRs in retrotransposons) were hypomethylated in neurons, compared with glia. Intraspecific DMRs were enriched in genes associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Interspecific DMRs were enriched in genes showing human-specific brain histone modifications. Human–chimpanzee methylation differences were much more frequent in non-neuronal cells (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 666) than in neurons (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 96). More than 95% of interspecific DMRs in glia were hypermethylated in humans. Although without an outgroup we cannot assign whether a change in methylation occurred in the human or chimpanzee lineage, our results are consistent with a wave of methylation affecting several hundred non-neuronal genes during human brain evolution.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>How are synaptic vesicles tied together in a nerve terminal? A recent study by Milovanovic and colleagues offers a new mechanism for this old and important problem: synapsin proteins establish a liquid phase that clusters vesicles. Liquid–liquid phase separation provides a fluid-like state that accommodates the dynamic demands of presynaptic vesicle traffic.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A prospective, observational study on conversion of Clinically Isolated Syndrome to Multiple Sclerosis during 4-year period (MS NEO study) in Taiwan</title>

	<description>Importance: CIS to MS conversion rates vary depending on population cohorts, initial manifestations, and durations of follow-up. Objective: To investigate conversion rate of patients from CIS to MS and the prognostic significance of demographic and clinical variables in Taiwanese population. Design: Nationwide, prospective, multi-centric, observational study from November 2008 to November 2014 with 4 years follow-up. Setting: Multi-centre setting at 5 institutions in Taiwan. Participants: 152 patients having single clinical event potentially suggestive of MS in last 2 years were enrolled as consecutive sample. 33 patients were lost to follow-up and 16 patients did not complete the study.103 patients completed the study. Intervention(s) (for clinical trials) or Exposure(s) (for observational studies): Natural progression from first episode of CIS to MS or NMO was observed. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Variables analysed were 'proportion of patients converting to MS or NMO after first episode of CIS', 'duration between first episode of neurological event and diagnosis of MS', 'status of anti-AQP4 IgG' and 'length of longest contiguous spinal cord lesion in MS patients'. Association between baseline characteristics and progression to MS from CIS was analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Multivariate time dependent effect of baseline characteristics on progression to MS was plotted. Results: 14.5% patients with CIS converted to MS after 1.1 {+/-} 1.0 years with greater predisposition (18.8%) in those having syndromes referable to the cerebral hemispheres. Conversion rate from ON to MS was 9.7%. 90.9% patients had benign disease course. 46.7% patients had abnormal MRIs at baseline, with 0.6{+/-}0.5 contrast enhanced lesions. 'Below normal BMI' and 'MRI lesion load ([≥] 4 lesions)' were identified as risk indicators for the development of MS. Only 4.5% were positive for anti-AQP4 antibody in MS patients and amongst them, 80% were NMO patients as diagnosed by modern criteria. Conclusions and Relevance: 'Below normal BMI' and 'number of demyelinating lesions ([≥]4)' are significant predictors of conversion from CIS to MS. A low conversion rate to MS in Taiwanese CIS patients and majority of them having a benign course and minimal disability suggest the roles of geographic, genetic and ethnic factors. Trial Registration: Non-trial observational study.</description>

	<description>The selective breeding for extreme behavior on the elevated plus-maze (EPM) resulted in two mouse lines namely high-anxiety behaving (HAB) and low-anxiety behaving (LAB) mice. Using novel behavioral tests we demonstrate that HAB animals additionally exhibit maladaptive escape behavior and defensive vocalizations, whereas LAB mice show profound deficits in escaping from approaching threats which partially results from sensory deficits. We could relate these behavioral distortions to tonic changes in brain activity within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in HAB mice and the superior colliculus (SC) in LAB mice, using in vivo manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) followed by pharmacological or chemogenetic interventions. Therefore, midbrain-tectal structures govern the expression of both anxiety-like behavior and defensive responses. Our results challenge the uncritical use of the anthropomorphic terms anxiety or anxiety-like for the description of mouse behavior, as they imply higher cognitive processes, which are not necessarily in place.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dopamine D1 receptor signalling differentially regulates action sequences and turning behaviour in freely moving Drosophila</title>

	<description>Here, we introduce a novel behavioural paradigm to study neural circuits and mechanisms underlying action selection and decision-making in freely moving Drosophila. We first validate our approach by studying FoxP mutants and show that normally invariant patterns of motor activity and turning behaviour are altered in these flies, reminiscent of indecision. Then, focusing on central complex (CX) circuits known to integrate different sensory modalities and controlling premotor regions, we show that action sequences and turning behaviour are regulated by dopamine D1 (Dop1R1) receptor signalling. Dop1R1 inputs onto CX columnar wedge and ellipsoid body R2/R4m ring neuron circuits both negatively gate motor activity but inversely control turning behaviour. While flies deficient of D1 receptor signalling present normal turning behaviour despite decreased activity, restoring Dop1R1 level in R2/R4m-specific circuitry affects the temporal organisation of motor actions and turning. These findings suggest that columnar wedge and ring neuron circuits of the CX differentially modulate patterns of motor action sequences and turning behaviour by comparative Dop1R1 signalling for goal-directed locomotion.</description>

	<description>Behavioral studies have suggested that mental projection of one's own body to a different spatial location (egocentric mental rotation) relies on brain areas that are also involved in processing actual self-motion based on vestibular input. Using fMRI, we set out to investigate the brain areas that underlie both simulated changes of the self in mental space and vestibular processing within the same individuals. Participants performed an egocentric mental rotation task during simultaneous Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) or sham stimulation. At the neural level, we expected an overlap between brain areas activated during vestibular processing and egocentric mental rotation within area OP2, a core brain region involved in vestibular processing. As predicted, the fMRI data showed an overlap of brain activity within area OP2 for both egocentric mental rotation and vestibular processing. GVS did not influence the ability to perform egocentric mental rotation. Our results provide evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying perceived and simulated self-motion. We conclude that mental rotations of one's body in-volve neural activity in area OP2, but also suggest that those mental simulations of one's body might be robust to modulatory input from artificial vestibular stimulation.</description>

	<description>Brain atrophy as measured from structural MR images, is one of the primary imaging biomarkers used to track neurodegenerative disease progression. In diseases such as frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer's disease, atrophy can be observed in key brain structures years before any clinical symptoms are present. Atrophy is most commonly captured as volume change of key structures and the shape changes of these structures are typically not analysed despite being potentially more sensitive than summary volume statistics over the entire structure. In this paper we propose a spatiotemporal analysis pipeline based Large Diffeomorphic Deformation Metric Mapping (LDDMM) to detect shape changes from volumetric MRI scans. We applied our framework to a cohort of individuals with genetic variants of frontotemporal dementia and healthy controls from the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) study. Our method, take full advantage of the LDDMM framework, and relies on the creation of a population specific average spatiotemporal trajectory of a relevant brain structure of interest, the thalamus in our case. The residuals from each patient data to the average spatiotemporal trajectory are then clustered and studied to assess when presymptomatic mutation carriers differ from healthy control subjects. We found statistical differences in shape in the anterior region of the thalamus at least five years before the mutation carrier subjects develop any clinical symptoms. This region of the thalamus has been shown to be predominantly connected to the frontal lobe, consistent with the pattern of cortical atrophy seen in the disease.</description>

	<description>Working memory is a critical function of the brain to maintain and manipulate information over delay periods of seconds. Sensory areas have been implicated in working memory; however, it is debated whether the delay-period activity of sensory regions is actively maintaining information or passively reflecting top-down inputs. We hereby examined the anterior piriform cortex, an olfactory cortex, in head-fixed mice performing a series of olfactory working memory tasks. Information maintenance is necessary in these tasks, especially in a dual-task paradigm in which mice are required to perform another distracting task while actively maintaining information during the delay period. Optogenetic suppression of the piriform cortex activity during the delay period impaired performance in all the tasks. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings revealed that the delay-period activity of the anterior piriform cortex encoded odor information with or without the distracting task. Thus, this sensory cortex is critical for active information maintenance in working memory.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Assessment of Functional Connectome Construction Strategies in Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>Connectomics can be used to investigate functional brain networks in neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease (HD). In this developing field, different connectome construction strategies have emerged in parallel. However, there is a need to understand the influences of different strategies on subsequent analyses when constructing a connectome. This study systematically compares connectome construction strategies based on their biological relevance to functional networks in neurodegeneration. We asked which functional connectome construction strategy was best able to discriminate HD gene carriers from healthy controls, and how such a strategy affected modular organization of the network. The major factors compared were principal component-based correction versus wavelet decomposition for physiological noise correction, the type of parcellation atlas (functional, structural and multi-modal), weighted versus binarized networks, and unthresholded versus proportionally thresholded networks. We found that principal component-based correction generated the most discriminatory connectomes, while binarization and proportional thresholding did not increase discrimination between HD gene carriers and healthy controls. When a functional parcellation atlas was used, the highest discrimination rates were obtained. We observed that the group differences in modular organization of the functional connectome were greatly affected by binarization and thresholding, showing no consistent pattern of modularity. This study suggests that functional connectome construction strategies using principal component-based correction and weighted unthresholded connectivity matrices may outperform other strategies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A computational model of loss of dopaminergic cells in Parkinson\'s disease due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity</title>

	<description>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive and inexorable loss of dopaminergic cells in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). A full understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of this cell loss is unavailable, though a number of mechanisms have been indicated in the literature. A couple of these mechanisms, however, show potential for the development of radical and promising PD therapeutics. One of these mechanisms is the peculiar metabolic vulnerability of SNc cells by virtue of their excessive energy demands; the other is the excitotoxicity caused by excessive glutamate release onto SNc by an overactive Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). To investigate the latter hypothesis computationally, we developed a spiking neuron network model of the SNc-STN-GPe system. In the model, prolonged stimulation of SNc cells by an overactive STN leads to an increase in a 'stress' variable; when the stress in a SNc neuron exceeds a stress threshold the neuron dies. The model shows that the interaction between SNc and STN involves a positive feedback due to which, an initial loss of SNc cells that crosses a threshold causes a runaway effect that leads to an inexorable loss of SNc cells, strongly resembling the process of neurodegeneration. The model further suggests a link between the two aforementioned PD mechanisms: metabolic vulnerability and glutamate excitotoxicity. Our simulation results show that the excitotoxic cause of SNc cell loss in PD might be initiated by weak excitotoxicity mediated by energy deficit, followed by strong excitotoxicity, mediated by a disinhibited STN. A variety of conventional therapies are simulated in the model to test their efficacy in slowing down or arresting SNc cell loss. Among the current therapeutics, glutamate inhibition, dopamine restoration, subthalamotomy and deep brain stimulation showed superior neuroprotective effects in the proposed model.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of cochlear synaptopathy on spontaneous and sound-evoked activity in the mouse inferior colliculus</title>

	<description>Tinnitus and hyperacusis are life-disrupting perceptual abnormalities that are often preceded by acoustic overexposure. Animal models of overexposure have suggested a link between these phenomena and neural hyperactivity, i.e. elevated spontaneous rates (SRs) and sound-evoked responses. Prior work has focused on changes in central auditory responses, with less attention paid to the exact nature of the associated peripheral damage. The demonstration that acoustic overexposure can cause cochlear nerve damage without permanent threshold elevation suggests this type of peripheral damage may be a key elicitor of tinnitus and hyperacusis in humans with normal audiograms. We addressed this idea by recording responses in the mouse inferior colliculus (IC) following a bilateral, neuropathic noise exposure. Two weeks post-exposure, mean SRs were unchanged in mice recorded while awake, or under anesthesia. SRs were also unaffected by more intense, or unilateral exposures. These results suggest that neither neuropathy nor hair cell loss are sufficient to raise SRs in the IC, at least in mice. However, it is not clear whether our mice had tinnitus. Tone-evoked rate-level functions at the CF were steeper following exposure, specifically in the region of maximal neuropathy. Furthermore, inhibition driven by off-CF tones and by ipsilateral noise were also reduced. Both changes were especially pronounced in neurons of awake mice. These findings align with prior reports of elevated acoustic startle in neuropathic mice, and indicate that neuropathy may initiate a compensatory response in the central auditory system leading to the genesis of hyperacusis.</description>

	<description>The anatomy of many neural circuits is being characterized with increasing resolution, but their molecular properties remain mostly unknown. Here, we characterize gene expression patterns in distinct neural cell types of the Drosophila visual system using genetic lines to access individual cell types, the TAPIN-seq method to measure their transcriptomes, and a probabilistic method to interpret these measurements. We used these tools to build a resource of high-resolution transcriptomes for 100 driver lines covering 67 cell types. Combining these transcriptomes with recently reported connectomes helps characterize how information is transmitted and processed across a range of scales, from individual synapses to circuit pathways. We describe examples that include identifying neurotransmitters, including cases of co-release, generating functional hypotheses based on receptor expression, as well as identifying strong commonalities between different cell types.</description>

	<description>Animal behaviors are robust and flexible. To elucidate how these two conflicting features of behavior are encoded in the nervous system, we analyzed the neural circuits generating a C. elegans thermotaxis behavior, in which animals migrate toward the past cultivation temperature (Tc). We identified multiple circuits that are highly overlapping but individually regulate distinct behavioral components to achieve thermotaxis. When the regulation of a behavioral component is disrupted following single cell ablations, the other components compensate the deficit, enabling the animals to robustly migrate toward the Tc. Depending on whether the environmental temperature surrounding the animals is above or below the Tc, different circuits regulate the same behavioral components, mediating the flexible switch between migration up or down toward the Tc. These context-dependencies within the overlapping sub-circuits reveal the implementation of degeneracy in the nervous system, providing a circuit-level basis for the robustness and flexibility of behavior.</description>

	<description>The wiring of the brain provides the anatomical skeleton for cognition and behavior. Connections among brain regions have a diverse and characteristic strength. This strength heterogeneity is captured by the wiring cost and homophily principles. Moreover, brains have a characteristic global network topology, including modularity and short path lengths. However, the mechanisms underlying the inter-regional wiring principles and global network topology of brains are unknown. Here, we address this issue by modeling the ontogeny of brain connectomes. We demonstrate that spatially embedded and heterochronous neurogenetic gradients, without the need of axonal-guidance molecules or activity-dependent plasticity, can reconstruct the wiring principles and shape the global network topology observed in adult brain connectomes. Thus, two fundamental dimensions, that is, space and time, are key components of a plausible neurodevelopmental mechanism with a universal scope, encompassing vertebrate and invertebrate brains.</description>

	<description>Metrics of brain network organization can be derived from neuroimaging data using graph theory. We explored the test-retest reliability of graph metrics of functional networks derived from resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Data were collected within two designs: (1) within sessions (WS) design where EEG data were collected from 18 healthy participants in four trials within a few hours and (2) between sessions (BS) design where EEG data were collected from 19 healthy participants in three trials on three different days at least one week apart. Electrophysiological source activity was reconstructed and functional connectivity between pairs of sensors or brain regions was determined in different frequency bands. We generated undirected binary graphs and used intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to estimate reliability. We showed that reliabilities ranged from poor to good. Reliability at the sensor-level was significantly higher than source-level. The most reliable graph metric at the sensor-level was cost efficiency and at the source-level was global efficiency. At the sensor-level: WS reliability was significantly higher than BS reliability; high beta band in WS design had the highest reliability; in WS design reliability in gamma band was significantly lower than reliability in low and high beta bands. At the source-level: the low beta band in BS design had the highest reliability; there was no significant main effect of frequency band on reliability; reliabilities of WS and BS designs were not significantly different. These results suggest that these graph metrics can provide reliable outcomes, depending on how the data were collected and analysed.</description>

	<description>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disease affecting over 6 million people worldwide. Current diagnosis is based on clinical and observational criteria only, resulting in a high misdiagnosis rate. Approximately 75% of people with PD have hand tremor, which can precede clinical diagnosis by up to 6 years. Previous studies have shown that early PD can be accurately detected from keystroke features while typing, and this study investigated whether tremor can be detected as well. Typing data from 76 subjects, with and without PD, including 27 with PD and 15 with tremor, was analysed and showed that hand tremor in PD can be detected from keystroke features. This novel technique has not been used before and was able to achieve an overall sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 80% and was also able to differentiate PD tremor from essential tremor. This means that the diagnosis of early PD through typing can achieve the clinical requirement of at least two cardinal features being present (bradykinesia and tremor). Less than half a page of typing is needed, the technique does not require any specialised equipment, and can take place in the patient's home as they type normally on a computer.</description>

	<description>Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are believed to establish their regular, spatially correlated firing patterns by path integration of the animal's motion. Mechanisms for path integration, e.g. in attractor network models, predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental boundaries, can correct such drift in grid cells. In our model, experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal cortex could interact dynamically and adaptively to achieve robust path integration.</description>

	<description>Previous approaches to investigating strategic social interaction in game theory have predominantly used games with clearly-defined turns and limited choices. However, most real-world social behaviors involve dynamic, coevolving decisions by interacting agents, which pose challenges for creating tractable models of behavior. Here, using a competitive game in which human participants control the dynamics of an on-screen avatar against either another human or a computer opponent, we show that it is possible to quantify the dynamic coupling between agents using nonparametric models. We use Gaussian Processes to model the joint distributions of players' actions and identities (human or computer) as a function of game state. Borrowing from a reinforcement learning framework, we successfully approximated both the policy and the value functions used by each human player in this competitive context. This approach offers a natural set of metrics for facilitating analysis at multiple timescales and suggests new classes of tractable paradigms for assessing human behavior.</description>

	<description>Elucidating the cellular architecture of the human neocortex is central to understanding our cognitive abilities and susceptibility to disease. Here we applied single nucleus RNA-sequencing to perform a comprehensive analysis of cell types in the middle temporal gyrus of human cerebral cortex. We identify a highly diverse set of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types that are mostly sparse, with excitatory types being less layer-restricted than expected. Comparison to a similar mouse cortex single cell RNA-sequencing dataset revealed a surprisingly well-conserved cellular architecture that enables matching of homologous types and predictions of human cell type properties. Despite this general conservation, we also find extensive differences between homologous human and mouse cell types, including dramatic alterations in proportions, laminar distributions, gene expression, and morphology. These species-specific features emphasize the importance of directly studying human brain.</description>

	<description>Understanding the information processing roles of cortical circuits is an outstanding problem in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The theoretical setting of Bayesian inference has been suggested as a framework for understanding cortical computation. Based on a recently published generative model for visual inference (George et al., 2017), we derive a family of anatomically instantiated and functional cortical circuit models. In contrast to simplistic models of Bayesian inference, the underlying generative model's representational choices are validated with real-world tasks that required efficient inference and strong generalization. The cortical circuit model is derived by systematically comparing the computational requirements of this model with known anatomical constraints. The derived model suggests precise functional roles for the feedforward, feedback and lateral connections observed in different laminae and columns, and assigns a computational role for the path through the thalamus.</description>

	<description>Autism and schizophrenia share some genotipic and phenotypic aspects as connectome miswiring and common cognitive deficits. Current diagnostics for both disorders include direct reports of relatives and clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist. Several medical imaging biomarkers have been proposed in the past. This work proposes a dynamical functional connectome analysis combined with machine learning techniques to complement the present diagnostic procedure. We used sliding window technique to locate a set of dynamic functional connectivity states and then use them as features to classify subjects as autism/schizophrenia or control. Moreover, by using dynamic functional connectivity measures we investigate the question whether those two disorders overlaps, namely whether the schizophrenia is part of the autism spectrum. The results reveals that both static and dynamic functional connectivity can be used to classify subjects with schizophrenia or autism.

	<description>The dopamine (DA) hypothesis posits the increase of mesolimbic dopamine levels as a defining commonality of addictive drugs, initially causing reinforcement, eventually leading to compulsive consumption. While much experimental evidence from psychostimulants supports this hypothesis, it has been challenged for opioid reinforcement. Here, we use genetically encoded DA and calcium indicators as well as cFos to reveal that heroin activates DA neurons located in the medial part of the VTA, preferentially projecting to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations of VTA DA or GABA neurons establish a causal link to heroin reinforcement. Inhibition of DA neurons blocked heroin self-administration, while heroin inhibited optogenetic self-stimulation of DA neurons. Likewise, heroin occluded the self-inhibition of VTA GABA neurons. Together, these experiments support a model of disinhibition of a subset of VTA DA neurons in opioid reinforcement.</description>

Glycosyltransferases are a class of enzymes that catalyse the posttranslational modification of proteins to produce a large number of glycoconjugate acceptors from a limited number of nucleotide-sugar donors. The products of one glycosyltransferase can be the substrates of several other enzymes, causing a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible glycan products. The kinetic behaviour of systems where multiple acceptor substrates compete for a single enzyme is presented, and the case in which high concentrations of an acceptor substrate are inhibitory as a result of abortive complex formation, is shown to result in non-Michaelian kinetics that can lead to bistability in an open system. A kinetic mechanism is proposed that is consistent with the available experimental evidence and provides a possible explanation for conflicting observations on the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-galactosyltransferases. Abrupt switching between steady states in networks of glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions may account for the observed changes in glycosyl-epitopes in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lG3i3Zrauw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Stochastic simulation has been a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, particularly in terms of understanding how cell-phenotype stability and fate-transitions are impacted by noisy gene expression. However, gene networks often have dynamics characterized by multiple attractors. Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such systems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare, barrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which may help guide rational cell reprogramming strategies. Our approach is also generalizable to other types of molecular networks and stochastic dynamics frameworks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ct0OUsyiK38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and is believed to participate in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A number of genes that regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified, although most of these have been implicated in progenitor proliferation and survival, but not in the development into fully differentiated neurons. Among these genes, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is particularly compelling because the human ApoE isoform E4 is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease, where hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be dysfunctional. To investigate the effects of ApoE and its human isoforms on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal development, retroviruses carrying a GFP-expressing vector were injected into wild-type (WT), ApoE-deficient, and human targeted replacement (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice to infect progenitors in the dentate gyrus and analyze the morphology of fully developed GFP-expressing neurons. Analysis of these adult-born neurons revealed significant decreases in the complexity of dendritic arborizations and spine density in ApoE-deficient mice compared with WT mice, as well as in ApoE4 mice compared with ApoE3. These findings demonstrate that ApoE deficiency and the ApoE4 human isoform both impair hippocampal neurogenesis and give insight into how ApoE may influence hippocampal-related neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Both the function of hippocampal neurons and hippocampus-dependent behaviors are dependent on changes in gene expression, but the specific mechanisms that regulate gene expression in hippocampus are not yet fully understood. The stable, activity-dependent transcription factor FosB plays a role in various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and in the structural plasticity of synapses onto CA1 neurons. The authors examined the consequences of viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of FosB on the function of adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice whole-cell physiology. We found that the overexpression of FosB decreased the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, while inhibition increased excitability. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect resting membrane potential or spike frequency adaptation, but FosB overexpression reduced hyperpolarization-activated current. Both FosB overexpression and inhibition decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, while only FosB inhibition affected the AMPA/NMDA ratio, which was mediated by decreased NMDA receptor current, suggesting complex effects on synaptic inputs to CA1 that may be driven by homeostatic cell-autonomous or network-driven adaptations to the changes in CA1 cell excitability. Because FosB is induced in hippocampus by drugs of abuse, stress, or antidepressant treatment, these results suggest that FosB-driven changes in hippocampal cell excitability may be critical for learning and, in maladaptive states, are key drivers of aberrant hippocampal function in diseases such as addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Estradiol Increases Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmission into GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO-Signaling in Proestrous Mice during the Positive Estradiol Feedback Period</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol (E2) level during positive feedback period. Here, we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-green fluorescent protein (GFP) neurons of mice. Whole-cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas it decreased at metestrus afternoon and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor β (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and scavenge of nitric oxide (NO) inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main NO receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating NO that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

white matter tracts were extracted from resting MEG recordings from a
normative, n=588, and a chronic TBI, traumatic brain injury, n=63, cohort, 60
of whose TBIs were mild. Activity in the TBI cohort was significantly reduced
compared with the norms for ten of the tracts, p &amp;lt; 10-6 for each. Significantly
reduced activity (p &amp;lt; 10-3) was seen in more than one tract in seven mTBI

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is the physiological basis of long term memory? The current dogma in
theoretical neuroscience attributes changes in synaptic efficacy to memory
acquisition. This view implies that in the absence of learning, synaptic
efficacies should be constant; in other words, stable memories correspond to
stable connectivity patterns. However, an increasing body of experimental
evidence points to significant, activity-independent dynamics in synaptic
strengths. These fluctuations seem to be occurring continuously, without
specific reference to a learning process, but with similar magnitude. Motivated
by these observations, we explore the possibility of memory storage within a
specific component of network connectivity, while individual connections
fluctuate in time. We find a family of neural network models in which memory is
acquired by means of biologically-inspired learning rules; the properties of
these rules, in turn, determine the storing component in which memory can
persist indefinitely. Memory representations manifest as time-varying
attractors in neural state-space and support associative retrieval of learned
information. Our results suggest a link between the properties of learning
rules and those of network-level memory representations, which generates
experimentally-testable predictions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Winner-Take-All as Basic Probabilistic Inference Unit of Neuronal Circuits. (arXiv:1808.00675v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00675</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experimental observations of neuroscience suggest that the brain is working a
probabilistic way when computing information with uncertainty. This processing
could be modeled as Bayesian inference. However, it remains unclear how
Bayesian inference could be implemented at the level of neuronal circuits of
the brain. In this study, we propose a novel general-purpose neural
implementation of probabilistic inference based on a ubiquitous network of
cortical microcircuits, termed winner-take-all (WTA) circuit. We show that each
WTA circuit could encode the distribution of states defined on a variable. By
connecting multiple WTA circuits together, the joint distribution can be
represented for arbitrary probabilistic graphical models. Moreover, we prove
that the neural dynamics of WTA circuit is able to implement one of the most
powerful inference methods in probabilistic graphical models, mean-field
inference. We show that the synaptic drive of each spiking neuron in the WTA
circuit encodes the marginal probability of the variable in each state, and the
firing probability (or firing rate) of each neuron is proportional to the
marginal probability. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that the WTA circuits can get comparable inference result as mean-field
approximation. Taken together, our results suggest that the WTA circuit could
be seen as the minimal inference unit of neuronal circuits.

	<description>Extensive evidence suggests that people use base rate information inconsistently in decision making. A classic example is the inverse base rate effect (IBRE), whereby participants classify ambiguous stimuli sharing features of both common and rare categories as members of the rare category. Computational models of the IBRE have either posited that it arises from associative similarity-based mechanisms or dissimilarity-based processes that may depend upon higher-level inference. Here we develop a hybrid model, which posits that similarity- and dissimilarity-based evidence both contribute to the IBRE, and test it using functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from human subjects completing an IBRE task. Consistent with our model, multivoxel pattern analysis reveals that activation patterns on ambiguous test trials contain information consistent with dissimilarity-based processing. Further, trial-by-trial activation in left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex tracks model-based predictions for dissimilarity-based processing, consistent with theories positing a role for higher-level symbolic processing in the IBRE.</description>

	<description>The P2X7 channel is involved in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases. An increasing number of studies suggest its presence in neurons where its putative functions remain controversial for more than a decade. To resolve this issue and to provide a model for analysis of P2X7 functions, we generated P2X7-BAC transgenic mice that allow visualization of functional EGFP-tagged P2X7 receptors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Extensive characterization of these mice revealed dominant P2X7-EGFP protein expression in microglia, Bergmann glia, and oligodendrocytes, but not in neurons. These findings were further validated by microglia- and oligodendrocyte-specific P2X7 deletion and a novel P2X7-specific nanobody. In addition to the first quantitative analysis of P2X7 protein expression in the CNS, we show potential consequences of its overexpression in ischemic retina and post-traumatic cerebral cortex grey matter. This novel mouse model overcomes previous limitations in P2X7 research and will help to determine its physiological roles and contribution to diseases.</description>

	<description>The biological properties of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain incompletely defined and the central regulators are unknown. By bioinformatic analysis of a human PCSC-enriched gene signature, we identified the transcription factor HNF1A as a putative central regulator of PCSC function. Levels of HNF1A and its target genes were found to be elevated in PCSCs and tumorspheres, and depletion of HNF1A resulted in growth inhibition, apoptosis, impaired tumorsphere formation, decreased PCSC marker expression, and downregulation of &lt;i&gt;POU5F1/OCT4&lt;/i&gt; expression. Conversely, HNF1A overexpression increased PCSC marker expression and tumorsphere formation in pancreatic cancer cells and drove PDA cell growth. Importantly, depletion of HNF1A in xenografts impaired tumor growth and depleted PCSC marker-positive cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, we established an HNF1A-dependent gene signature in PDA cells that significantly correlated with reduced survivability in patients. These findings identify HNF1A as a central transcriptional regulator of PCSC properties and novel oncogene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ultrastructural, Molecular and Functional Mapping of GABAergic Synapses on Dendritic Spines and Shafts of Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The location of GABAergic synapses on dendrites is likely key for neuronal integration. In particular, inhibitory inputs on dendritic spines could serve to selectively veto or modulate individual excitatory inputs, greatly expanding the computational power of individual neurons. To investigate this, we have undertaken a combined functional, molecular, and ultrastructural mapping of the location of GABAergic inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal neurons from upper layers of juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. Using two-photon uncaging of GABA, intracellular labeling with gerphyrin intrabodies, and focused ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy, we find that most (96–98%) spines lack GABAergic synapses, although they still display GABAergic responses, potentially due to extrasynaptic GABA receptors. We conclude that GABAergic inputs, in practice, contact dendritic shafts and likely control clusters of excitatory inputs, defining functional zones on dendrites.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Cellular morphology and associated morphodynamics are widely used for qualitative and quantitative assessments of cell state. Here we implement a framework to profile cellular morphodynamics based on an adaptive decomposition of local cell boundary motion into instantaneous frequency spectra defined by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Our approach revealed that spontaneously migrating cells with approximately homogeneous molecular makeup show remarkably consistent instantaneous frequency distributions, though they have markedly heterogeneous mobility. Distinctions in cell edge motion between these cells are captured predominantly by differences in the magnitude of the frequencies. We found that acute photo-inhibition of Vav2 guanine exchange factor, an activator of the Rho family of signaling proteins coordinating cell motility, produces significant shifts in the frequency distribution, but does not affect frequency magnitude. We therefore concluded that the frequency spectrum encodes the wiring of the molecular circuitry that regulates cell boundary movements, whereas the magnitude captures the activation level of the circuitry. We also used HHT spectra as multi-scale spatiotemporal features in statistical region merging to identify subcellular regions of distinct motion behavior. In line with our conclusion that different HHT spectra relate to different signaling regimes, we found that subcellular regions with different morphodynamics indeed exhibit distinct Rac1 activities. This algorithm thus can serve as an accurate and sensitive classifier of cellular morphodynamics to pinpoint spatial and temporal boundaries between signaling regimes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v0zeezADMos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Several channels, ranging from TRP receptors to Gap junctions, allow the exchange of small organic solute across cell membrane. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of their permeation. Cyclic Nucleotide Gated (CNG) channels, despite their homology with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and in contrast with them, allow the passage of larger methylated and ethylated ammonium ions like dimethylammonium (DMA) and ethylammonium (EA). We combined electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations to examine how DMA interacts with the pore and permeates through it. Due to the presence of hydrophobic groups, DMA enters easily in the channel and, unlike the alkali cations, does not need to cross any barrier. We also show that while the crystal structure is consistent with the presence of a single DMA ion at full occupancy, the channel is able to conduct a sizable current of DMA ions only when two ions are present inside the channel. Moreover, the second DMA ion dramatically changes the free energy landscape, destabilizing the crystallographic binding site and lowering by almost 25 kJ/mol the binding affinity between DMA and the channel. Based on the results of the simulation the experimental electron density maps can be re-interpreted with the presence of a second ion at lower occupancy. In this mechanism the flexibility of the channel plays a key role, extending the classical multi-ion permeation paradigm in which conductance is enhanced by the plain interaction between the ions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lr7lghkzqrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Although NSCs were thought to merely represent a stem cell type in the brain, recent advances have demonstrated the incredible complexity of NSC identity and functions. Ranging between quiescence, activation and intermediary subtypes, NSCs choose their fate through their developmental inheritance, regional positioning within the niche, as well as dynamic transcriptional and metabolic states. The plasticity of their developmental program is reflected in the tremendous changes they undergo upon external environmental cues and extrinsic manipulations, and harnessing these potentials can open new avenues to fight against brain injury, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Efficient pattern separation in dentate gyrus plays an important role in
storing information in the hippocampus. Current knowledge of the structure and
function of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus, in pattern
separation are incorporated in our model. A three-layer feedforward spiking
neural network inspired by the rodent hippocampus an equipped with simplified
synaptic and molecular mechanisms is developed. The aim of the study is to make
an spiking neural network capable of pattern separation in imbalanced
excitation/inhibition ratios caused by different levels of stimulations or
network damage. This work present a novel theory on the cellular mechanisms of
robustness to damges to synapses and connectivity of neurons in dentate gyrus
that results in imbalanced excitation-inhibition activity of neurons. This
spiking neural network uses simplified molecular and cellular hypothetical
mechanisms and demonstrates efficient storing of information in different
levels of stimulation and can be implemented in cognitive robotics.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38770</link>
	<description>Hearing and balance involve the transduction of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals by deflection of bundles of stereocilia linked together by protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 'tip links'. PCDH15 transduces tip link tension into opening of a mechano-electrical transduction (MET) ion channel. PCDH15 also interacts with LHFPL5, a candidate subunit of the MET channel. Here we illuminate the PCDH15-LHFPL5 structure, showing how the complex is composed of PCDH15 and LHFPL5 subunit pairs related by a 2-fold axis. The extracellular cadherin domains define a mobile tether coupled to a rigid, 2-fold symmetric 'collar' proximal to the membrane bilayer. LHFPL5 forms extensive interactions with the PCDH15 transmembrane helices and stabilizes the overall PCDH15-LHFPL5 assembly. Our studies illuminate the architecture of the PCDH15-LHFPL5 complex, localize mutations associated with deafness, and shed new light on how forces in the PCDH15 tether may be transduced into the stereocilia membrane.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: MDN brain descending neurons coordinately activate backward and inhibit forward locomotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38554</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38554</link>
	<description>Command-like descending neurons can induce many behaviors, such as backward locomotion, escape, feeding, courtship, egg-laying, or grooming (we define 'command-like neuron' as a neuron whose activation elicits or 'commands' a specific behavior). In most animals it remains unknown how neural circuits switch between antagonistic behaviors: via top-down activation/inhibition of antagonistic circuits or via reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic circuits. Here we use genetic screens, intersectional genetics, circuit reconstruction by electron microscopy, and functional optogenetics to identify a bilateral pair of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval 'mooncrawler descending neurons' (MDNs) with command-like ability to coordinately induce backward locomotion and block forward locomotion; the former by stimulating a backward-active premotor neuron, and the latter by disynaptic inhibition of a forward-specific premotor neuron. In contrast, direct monosynaptic reciprocal inhibition between forward and backward circuits was not observed. Thus, MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors. Interestingly, larval MDNs persist into adulthood, where they can trigger backward walking. Thus, MDNs induce backward locomotion in both limbless and limbed animals.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Efficient support of virus-like particle assembly by the HIV-1 packaging signal</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38438</link>
	<description>The principal structural component of a retrovirus particle is the Gag protein. Retroviral genomic RNAs contain a 'packaging signal' ('Ψ') and are packaged in virus particles with very high selectivity. However, if no genomic RNA is present, Gag assembles into particles containing cellular mRNA molecules. The mechanism by which genomic RNA is normally selected during virus assembly is not understood. We previously reported (Comas-Garcia et al., 2017) that at physiological ionic strength, recombinant HIV-1 Gag binds with similar affinities to RNAs with or without Ψ, and proposed that genomic RNA is selectively packaged because binding to Ψ initiates particle assembly more efficiently than other RNAs. We now present data directly supporting this hypothesis. We also show that one or more short stretches of unpaired G residues are important elements of Ψ; Ψ may not be localized to a single structural element, but is probably distributed over &amp;gt;100 bases.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Aurora kinase A localises to mitochondria to control organelle dynamics and energy production</title>

	<description>Many epithelial cancers show cell cycle dysfunction tightly correlated with the overexpression of the serine/threonine kinase Aurora A (AURKA). Its role in mitotic progression has been extensively characterised, and evidence for new AURKA functions emerges. Here, we reveal that AURKA is located and imported in mitochondria in several human cancer cell lines. Mitochondrial AURKA impacts on two organelle functions: mitochondrial dynamics and energy production. When AURKA is expressed at endogenous levels during interphase, it induces mitochondrial fragmentation independently from RALA. Conversely, AURKA enhances mitochondrial fusion and ATP production when it is over-expressed. We demonstrate that AURKA directly regulates mitochondrial functions and that AURKA over-expression promotes metabolic reprogramming by increasing mitochondrial interconnectivity. Our work paves the way to anti-cancer therapeutics based on the simultaneous targeting of mitochondrial functions and AURKA inhibition.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37727</link>
	<description>Freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incapacitating transient phenomenon, followed by continuous postural disorders. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a promising intervention for FoG in patients with PD, however its effects on distinct domains of postural control is not well known. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of SCS on FoG and distinct domains of postural control. Four patients with FoG were implanted with SCS systems in the upper thoracic spine. Anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), reactive postural responses, gait and FoG were biomechanically assessed. In general, the results showed that SCS improved FoG and APA. However, SCS failed to improve reactive postural responses. SCS seems to influence cortical motor circuits, involving the supplementary motor area. On the other hand, reactive posture control to external perturbation that mainly relies on neuronal circuitries involving the brainstem and spinal cord, is less influenced by SCS.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Loss of Fam60a, a Sin3a subunit, results in embryonic lethality and is associated with aberrant methylation at a subset of gene promoters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36435</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36435</link>
	<description>We have examined the role of &lt;i&gt;Fam60a&lt;/i&gt;, a gene highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, in mouse development. Fam60a interacts with components of the Sin3a-Hdac transcriptional corepressor complex, and most &lt;i&gt;Fam60a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos manifest hypoplasia of visceral organs and die in utero. Fam60a is recruited to the promoter regions of a subset of genes, with the expression of these genes being either up- or down-regulated in &lt;i&gt;Fam60a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos. The DNA methylation level of the Fam60a target gene &lt;i&gt;Adhfe1&lt;/i&gt; is maintained at embryonic day (E) 7.5 but markedly reduced at E9.5 in &lt;i&gt;Fam60a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, suggesting that DNA demethylation is enhanced in the mutant. Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation identified several differentially methylated regions, which were preferentially hypomethylated, in &lt;i&gt;Fam60a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos. Our data suggest that Fam60a is required for proper embryogenesis, at least in part as a result of its regulation of DNA methylation at specific gene promoters.</description>

	<description>The mechanisms underlying biological aging are becoming recognized as therapeutic targets to delay the onset of multiple age-related morbidities. Even greater health benefits can potentially be achieved by halting or reversing age-associated changes. &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; restore their tissues and normal longevity upon exit from prolonged adult reproductive diapause, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we focused on the mechanisms controlling recovery from adult diapause. Here, we show that functional improvement of post-mitotic somatic tissues does not require germline signaling, germline stem cells, or replication of nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Instead a large expansion of the somatic RNA pool is necessary for restoration of youthful function and longevity. Treating animals with the drug 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine prevents this restoration by blocking reactivation of RNA metabolism. These observations define a critical early step during exit from adult reproductive diapause that is required for somatic rejuvenation of an adult metazoan animal.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the impact of changes in day-care contact patterns on the dynamics of varicella transmission in France between 1991 and 2015</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Marziano, Piero Poletti, Guillaume Béraud, Pierre-Yves Boëlle, Stefano Merler, Vittoria Colizza&lt;/p&gt;

Annual incidence rates of varicella infection in the general population in France have been rather stable since 1991 when clinical surveillance started. Rates however show a statistically significant increase over time in children aged 0–3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures’ capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991–2015. Our findings suggest that an earlier exposure to pathogens due to changes in day-care contact patterns, represents a plausible explanation for the epidemiological patterns observed in France. Obtained results suggest that considering temporal changes in social factors in addition to demographic ones is critical to correctly interpret varicella transmission dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZNcGQQSchNU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions in cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which sensory inputs are relevant versus irrelevant. Here, we develop a neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes the expected magnitude of reward or punishment (“relevance”), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feedforward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. In the model, irrelevant and blocked stimuli drive lower levels of excitatory activity compared with novel and relevant stimuli, and this difference in activity levels is lost following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer with a threshold, the relevance code can be shown to “gate” both learning and behavioral responses to irrelevant stimuli. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components, respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rsPCF-wkzJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Until recently, hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons were the only known wake-promoting neuronal population in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in this area and glutamatergic neurons in the nearby supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have recently been found that also promote wakefulness. We performed chemogenetic excitation of LH neurons in mice and observed increased wakefulness that lasted more than 4h without unusual behavior or EEG anomalies. The increased wakefulness was similar in the presence or absence of the dual orexin receptor blocker almorexant (ALM). Analysis of hM3Dq transfection and c-FOS expression in LH inhibitory neurons and in the SuM failed to confirm that the increased wakefulness was due to these wake-promoting populations, although this possibility cannot be completely excluded. To evaluate the relationship to the Hcrt system, we repeated the study in &lt;i&gt;Orexin-tTA&lt;/i&gt; mice in the presence or absence of dietary doxycycline (DOX), which enabled us to manipulate the percentage of Hcrt neurons that expressed hM3Dq. In DOX-fed mice, 18% of Hcrt neurons as well as many other LH neurons expressed hM3Dq; these mice showed a profound increase in wake after hM3Dq activation even in the presence of ALM. In mice switched to normal chow, 62% of Hcrt neurons expressed hM3Dq along with other LH cells; chemogenetic activation produced even more sustained arousal which could be reduced to previous levels by ALM treatment. Together, these results indicate an LH neuron population that promotes wakefulness through an Hcrt-independent pathway that can act synergistically with the Hcrt system to prolong arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Despite nearly a century of evidence suggesting that the lateral hypothalamus contains neurons essential to sustain wakefulness, the primary wake-promoting cells in this brain region studied to date have been the hypocretin/orexin neurons. Here, we show that chemogenetic excitation of lateral hypothalamus neurons can induce sustained wakefulness even in absence of hypocretin signaling and that concurrent hypocretin neuron activation can prolong arousal. These results indicate the existence of parallel arousal pathways in the lateral hypothalamus and suggest a new therapeutic target for disorders of excessive sleepiness such as hypersomnia and narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-in Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation to inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using novel quantitative analyses of spontaneous synaptic currents in L2/3 pyramidal cells, we revealed subtle deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) in a new mouse model of AD, the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We applied novel statistical and analytical methods to further characterize the properties of spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Our approach provides rigorous quantitative tools for the analysis of synaptic events in mouse models of disease for objectively and reliably revealing even subtle disease-related alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Grid-Cell Activity on Linear Tracks Indicates Purely Translational Remapping of 2D Firing Patterns at Movement Turning Points</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/7004?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a critical role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. For movements along a linear track the cells seem to respond differently. They show multiple firing fields that are not periodically arranged and whose shape and position change when the running direction is reversed. In addition, peak firing rates vary widely from field to field. Measured along one running direction only, firing fields are, however, compatible with a slice through a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal pattern. It is an open question, whether this is also true if leftward and rightward runs are jointly considered. By analyzing data from 15 male Long–Evans rats, we show that a single hexagonal firing pattern explains the linear-track data if translational shifts of the pattern are allowed at the movement turning points. A rotation or scaling of the grid is not required. The agreement is further improved if the peak firing rates of the underlying 2D grid fields can vary from field to field, as suggested by recent studies. These findings have direct consequences for experiments using linear tracks in virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Various types of neurons support spatial navigation. Their response properties are often studied in reduced settings and might change when the animal can freely explore its environment. Grid cells in rodents, for example, exhibit seemingly irregular firing fields when animal movement is restricted to a linear track but highly regular patterns in two-dimensional (2D) arenas. We show that linear-track responses of a cell for both leftward and rightward running directions can be explained as cuts through a single hexagonal pattern if translational remapping is allowed at movement turning points; neither rotations nor scale transformations are needed. These results provide a basis to quantify grid-cell activity in 1D virtual reality and could help to detect and categorize grid cells without experiments in 2D environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide-Immunoreactive Interneurons within Circuits of the Mouse Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6983?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In cortical structures, principal cell activity is tightly regulated by different GABAergic interneurons (INs). Among these INs are vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) INs, which innervate preferentially other INs, providing a structural basis for temporal disinhibition of principal cells. However, relatively little is known about VIP+ INs in the amygdaloid basolateral complex (BLA). In this study, we report that VIP+ INs have a variable density in the distinct subdivisions of the mouse BLA. Based on different anatomical, neurochemical, and electrophysiological criteria, VIP+ INs could be identified as IN-selective INs (IS-INs) and basket cells expressing CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Whole-cell recordings of VIP+ IS-INs revealed three different spiking patterns, none of which was associated with the expression of calretinin. Genetic targeting combined with optogenetics and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; recordings enabled us to identify several types of BLA INs innervated by VIP+ INs, including other IS-INs, basket and neurogliaform cells. Moreover, light stimulation of VIP+ basket cell axon terminals, characterized by CB1 sensitivity, evoked IPSPs in ~20% of principal neurons. Finally, we show that VIP+ INs receive a dense innervation from both GABAergic inputs (although only 10% from other VIP+ INs) and distinct glutamatergic inputs, identified by their expression of different vesicular glutamate transporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study provides a wide-range analysis of single-cell properties of VIP+ INs in the mouse BLA and of their intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity. Our results reinforce the evidence that VIP+ INs are structurally and functionally heterogeneous and that this heterogeneity could mediate different roles in amygdala-dependent functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide the first comprehensive analysis of the distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons (INs) across the entire mouse amygdaloid basolateral complex (BLA), as well as of their morphological and physiological properties. VIP+ INs in the neocortex preferentially target other INs to form a disinhibitory network that facilitates principal cell firing. Our study is the first to demonstrate the presence of such a disinhibitory circuitry in the BLA. We observed structural and functional heterogeneity of these INs and characterized their input/output connectivity. We also identified several types of BLA INs that, when inhibited, may provide a temporal window for principal cell firing and facilitate associative plasticity, e.g., in fear learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Hierarchy of Time Scales for Discriminating and Classifying the Temporal Shape of Sound in Three Auditory Cortical Fields</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6967?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory cortex is essential for mammals, including rodents, to detect temporal &quot;shape&quot; cues in the sound envelope but it remains unclear how different cortical fields may contribute to this ability (Lomber and Malhotra, 2008; Threlkeld et al., 2008). Previously, we found that precise spiking patterns provide a potential neural code for temporal shape cues in the sound envelope in the primary auditory (A1), and ventral auditory field (VAF) and caudal suprarhinal auditory field (cSRAF) of the rat (Lee et al., 2016). Here, we extend these findings and characterize the time course of the temporally precise output of auditory cortical neurons in male rats. A pairwise sound discrimination index and a Naive Bayesian classifier are used to determine how these spiking patterns could provide brain signals for behavioral discrimination and classification of sounds. We find response durations and optimal time constants for discriminating sound envelope shape increase in rank order with: A1 &amp;lt; VAF &amp;lt; cSRAF. Accordingly, sustained spiking is more prominent and results in more robust sound discrimination in non-primary cortex versus A1. Spike-timing patterns classify 10 different sound envelope shape sequences and there is a twofold increase in maximal performance when pooling output across the neuron population indicating a robust distributed neural code in all three cortical fields. Together, these results support the idea that temporally precise spiking patterns from primary and non-primary auditory cortical fields provide the necessary signals for animals to discriminate and classify a large range of temporal shapes in the sound envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Functional hierarchies in the visual cortices support the concept that classification of visual objects requires successive cortical stages of processing including a progressive increase in classical receptive field size. The present study is significant as it supports the idea that a similar progression exists in auditory cortices in the time domain. We demonstrate for the first time that three cortices provide temporal spiking patterns for robust temporal envelope shape discrimination but only the ventral non-primary cortices do so on long time scales. This study raises the possibility that primary and non-primary cortices provide unique temporal spiking patterns and time scales for perception of sound envelope shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Processing of Acoustic and Electric Interaural Time Differences in Normal-Hearing Gerbils</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6949?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bilateral cochlear implants (CIs) provide benefits for speech perception in noise and directional hearing, but users typically show poor sensitivity to interaural time differences (ITDs). Possible explanations for this deficit are deafness-induced degradations in neural ITD sensitivity, between-ear mismatches in electrode positions or activation sites, or differences in binaural brain circuits activated by electric versus acoustic stimulation. To identify potential limitations of electric ITD coding in the normal-hearing system, responses of single neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and in the inferior colliculus to ITDs of electric (biphasic pulses) and acoustic (noise, clicks, chirps, and tones) stimuli were recorded in normal-hearing gerbils of either sex. To maintain acoustic sensitivity, electric stimuli were delivered to the round window. ITD tuning metrics (e.g., best ITD) and ITD discrimination thresholds for electric versus transient acoustic stimuli (clicks, chirps) obtained from the same neurons were not significantly correlated. Across populations of neurons with similar characteristic frequencies, however, ITD tuning metrics and ITD discrimination thresholds were similar for electric and acoustic stimuli and largely independent of the spectrotemporal properties of the acoustic stimuli when measured in the central range of ITDs. The similarity of acoustic and electric ITD coding on the population level in animals with normal hearing experience suggests that poorer ITD sensitivity in bilateral CI users compared with normal-hearing listeners is likely due to deprivation-induced changes in neural ITD coding rather than to differences in the binaural brain circuits involved in the processing of electric and acoustic ITDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Small differences in the arrival time of sound at the two ears (interaural time differences, ITDs) provide important cues for speech understanding in noise and directional hearing. Deaf subjects with bilateral cochlear implants obtain only little benefit from ITDs. It is unclear whether these limitations are due to between-ear mismatches in activation sites, differences in binaural brain circuits activated by electric versus acoustic stimulation, or deafness-induced degradations in neural ITD processing. This study is the first to directly compare electric and acoustic ITD coding in neurons of known characteristic frequencies. In animals with normal hearing, populations of auditory brainstem and midbrain neurons demonstrate general similarities in electric and acoustic ITD coding, suggesting similar underlying central auditory processing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Binocular Neuronal Processing of Object Motion in an Arthropod</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6933?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals use binocular information to guide many behaviors. In highly visual arthropods, complex binocular computations involved in processing panoramic optic flow generated during self-motion occur in the optic neuropils. However, the extent to which binocular processing of object motion occurs in these neuropils remains unknown. We investigated this in a crab, where the distance between the eyes and the extensive overlapping of their visual fields advocate for the use of binocular processing. By performing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intracellular recordings from the lobula (third optic neuropil) of male crabs, we assessed responses of object-motion-sensitive neurons to ipsilateral or contralateral moving objects under binocular and monocular conditions. Most recorded neurons responded to stimuli seen independently with either eye, proving that each lobula receives profuse visual information from both eyes. The contribution of each eye to the binocular response varies among neurons, from those receiving comparable inputs from both eyes to those with mainly ipsilateral or contralateral components, some including contralateral inhibition. Electrophysiological profiles indicated that a similar number of neurons were recorded from their input or their output side. In monocular conditions, the first group showed shorter response delays to ipsilateral than to contralateral stimulation, whereas the second group showed the opposite. These results fit well with neurons conveying centripetal and centrifugal information from and toward the lobula, respectively. Intracellular and massive stainings provided anatomical support for this and for direct connections between the two lobulae, but simultaneous recordings failed to reveal such connections. Simplified model circuits of interocular connections are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most active animals became equipped with two eyes, which contributes to functions like depth perception, objects spatial location, and motion processing, all used for guiding behaviors. In visually active arthropods, binocular neural processing of the panoramic optic flow generated during self-motion happens already in the optic neuropils. However, whether binocular processing of single-object motion occurs in these neuropils remained unknown. We investigated this in a crab, where motion-sensitive neurons from the lobula can be recorded in the intact animal. Here we demonstrate that different classes of neurons from the lobula compute binocular information. Our results provide new insight into where and how the visual information acquired by the two eyes is first combined in the brain of an arthropod.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Muscarinic Receptor M3R Signaling Prevents Efficient Remyelination by Human and Mouse Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6921?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Muscarinic receptor antagonists act as potent inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation and accelerate remyelination. However, the use of muscarinic antagonists in the clinic is limited by poor understanding of the operant receptor subtype, and questions regarding possible species differences between rodents and humans. Based on high selective expression in human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), we hypothesized that M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R is the functionally relevant receptor. Lentiviral M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R knockdown in human primary CD140a/PDGFαR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs resulted in enhanced differentiation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and substantially reduced the calcium response following muscarinic agonist treatment. Importantly, following transplantation in hypomyelinating &lt;i&gt;shiverer/rag2&lt;/i&gt; mice, M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R knockdown improved remyelination by human OPCs. Furthermore, conditional M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R ablation in adult NG2-expressing OPCs increased oligodendrocyte differentiation and led to improved spontaneous remyelination in mice. Together, we demonstrate that M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R receptor mediates muscarinic signaling in human OPCs that act to delay differentiation and remyelination, suggesting that M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are viable targets for human demyelinating disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The identification of drug targets aimed at improving remyelination in patients with demyelination disease is a key step in development of effective regenerative therapies to treat diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Muscarinic receptor antagonists have been identified as effective potentiators of remyelination, but the receptor subtypes that mediate these receptors are unclear. In this study, we show that genetic M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R ablation in both mouse and human cells results in improved remyelination and is mediated by acceleration of oligodendrocyte commitment from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Therefore, M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R represents an attractive target for induced remyelination in human disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chrna5-Expressing Neurons in the Interpeduncular Nucleus Mediate Aversion Primed by Prior Stimulation or Nicotine Exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies have shown an association between smoking and variation at the &lt;i&gt;CHRNA5/A3/B4&lt;/i&gt; gene locus encoding the α5, α3, and β4 nicotinic receptor subunits. The α5 receptor has been specifically implicated because smoking-associated haplotypes contain a coding variant in the &lt;i&gt;CHRNA5&lt;/i&gt; gene. The &lt;i&gt;Chrna5/a3/b4&lt;/i&gt; locus is conserved in rodents and the restricted expression of these subunits suggests neural pathways through which the reinforcing and aversive properties of nicotine may be mediated. Here, we show that, in the interpeduncular nucleus (IP), the site of the highest &lt;i&gt;Chrna5&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in rodents, electrophysiological responses to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation are markedly reduced in α5-null mice. IP neurons differ markedly from their upstream ventral medial habenula cholinergic partners, which appear unaltered by loss of α5. To probe the functional role of α5-containing IP neurons, we used BAC recombineering to generate transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase from the &lt;i&gt;Chrna5&lt;/i&gt; locus. Reporter expression driven by Chrna5&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrates that transcription of &lt;i&gt;Chrna5&lt;/i&gt; is regulated independently from the &lt;i&gt;Chrna3/b4&lt;/i&gt; genes transcribed on the opposite strand. Chrna5-expressing IP neurons are GABAergic and project to distant targets in the mesopontine raphe and tegmentum rather than forming local circuits. Optogenetic stimulation of Chrna5-expressing IP neurons failed to elicit physical manifestations of withdrawal. However, after recent prior stimulation or exposure to nicotine, IP stimulation becomes aversive. These results using mice of both sexes support the idea that the risk allele of CHRNA5 may increase the drive to smoke via loss of IP-mediated nicotine aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the receptors and neural pathways underlying the reinforcing and aversive effects of nicotine may suggest new treatments for tobacco addiction. Part of the individual variability in smoking is associated with specific forms of the α5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene. Here, we show that deletion of the α5 subunit in mice markedly reduces the cellular response to nicotine and acetylcholine in the interpeduncular nucleus (IP). Stimulation of α5-expressing IP neurons using optogenetics is aversive, but this effect requires priming by recent prior stimulation or exposure to nicotine. These results support the idea that the smoking-associated variant of the α5 gene may increase the drive to smoke via loss of IP-mediated nicotine aversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Associative Prediction of Visual Shape in the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perception can be cast as a process of inference, in which bottom-up signals are combined with top-down predictions in sensory systems. In line with this, neural activity in sensory cortex is strongly modulated by prior expectations. Such top-down predictions often arise from cross-modal associations, such as when a sound (e.g., bell or bark) leads to an expectation of the visual appearance of the corresponding object (e.g., bicycle or dog). We hypothesized that the hippocampus, which rapidly learns arbitrary relationships between stimuli over space and time, may be involved in forming such associative predictions. We exposed male and female human participants to auditory cues predicting visual shapes, while measuring high-resolution fMRI signals in visual cortex and the hippocampus. Using multivariate reconstruction methods, we discovered a dissociation between these regions: representations in visual cortex were dominated by whichever shape was presented, whereas representations in the hippocampus reflected only which shape was predicted by the cue. The strength of hippocampal predictions correlated across participants with the amount of expectation-related facilitation in visual cortex. These findings help bridge the gap between memory and sensory systems in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The way we perceive the world is to a great extent determined by our prior knowledge. Despite this intimate link between perception and memory, these two aspects of cognition have mostly been studied in isolation. Here we investigate their interaction by asking how memory systems that encode and retrieve associations can inform perception. We find that upon hearing a familiar auditory cue, the hippocampus represents visual information that had previously co-occurred with the cue, even when this expectation differs from what is currently visible. Furthermore, the strength of this hippocampal expectation correlates with facilitation of perceptual processing in visual cortex. These findings help bridge the gap between memory and sensory systems in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Maintenance of Mouse Gustatory Terminal Field Organization Is Dependent on BDNF at Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6873?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6873?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The rodent peripheral gustatory system is especially plastic during early postnatal development and maintains significant anatomical plasticity into adulthood. Thus, taste information carried from the tongue to the brain is built and maintained on a background of anatomical circuits that have the capacity to change throughout the animal's lifespan. Recently, the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was shown to be required in the tongue to maintain normal levels of innervation in taste buds at adulthood, indicating that BDNF is a key molecule in the maintenance of nerve/target matching in taste buds. Here, we tested whether maintenance of the central process of these gustatory nerves at adulthood also relies on BDNF by using male and female transgenic mice with inducible CreERT2 under the control of the keratin 14 promoter or under control of the ubiquitin promoter to remove &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; from the tongue or from all tissues, respectively. We found that the terminal fields of gustatory nerves in the nucleus of the solitary tract were expanded when &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; was removed from the tongue at adulthood and with even larger and more widespread changes in mice where &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; was removed from all tissues. Removal of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; did not affect numbers of ganglion cells that made up the nerves and did not affect peripheral, whole-nerve taste responses. We conclude that normal expression of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; in gustatory structures is required to maintain normal levels of innervation at adulthood and that the central effects of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; removal are opposite of those in the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; BDNF plays a major role in the development and maintenance of proper innervation of taste buds. However, the importance of BDNF in maintaining innervation patterns of gustatory nerves into central targets has not been assessed. Here, we tested whether &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; removal from the tongue or from all structures in adult mice impacts the maintenance of how taste nerves project to the first central relay. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; from the tongue and from all tissues led to a progressively greater expansion of terminal fields. This demonstrates, for the first time, that BDNF is necessary for the normal maintenance of central gustatory circuits at adulthood and further highlights a level of plasticity not seen in other sensory system subcortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Perinatal Exposure to an Environmentally Relevant Mixture of Phthalates Results in a Lower Number of Neurons and Synapses in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Decreased Cognitive Flexibility in Adult Male and Female Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The growth and organization of the developing brain are known to be influenced by hormones, but little is known about whether disruption of hormones affects cortical regions, such as mPFC. This region is particularly important given its involvement in executive functions and implication in the pathology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we examine the long-term effects of perinatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds, the phthalates, on the mPFC and associated behavior. This investigation is pertinent as humans are ubiquitously exposed to phthalates through a variety of consumer products and phthalates can readily cross the placenta and be delivered to offspring via lactation. Pregnant dams orally consumed an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates at 0, 200, or 1000 μg/kg/d through pregnancy and for 10 d while lactating. As adults, offspring were tested in an attentional set-shifting task, which assesses cognitive flexibility. Brains were also examined in adulthood for stereological quantification of the number of neurons, glia, and synapses within the mPFC. We found that, independent of sex, perinatal phthalate exposure at either dose resulted in a reduction in neuron number, synapse number, and size of the mPFC and a deficit in cognitive flexibility. Interestingly, the number of synapses was correlated with cognitive flexibility, such that rats with fewer synapses were less cognitively flexible than those with more synapses. These results demonstrate that perinatal phthalate exposure can have long-term effects on the cortex and behavior of both male and female rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans globally are exposed on a daily basis to a variety of phthalates, which are endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The effects of phthalate exposure on the developing brain, especially on cognitively relevant regions, such as the mPFC, are not known. Here, we use a rat model of human prenatal exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates and find that there is an appreciable reduction in neuron number, synapse number, and size of the mPFC and a deficit in cognitive flexibility. These results may have serious implications for humans given that the mPFC is involved in executive functions and is implicated in the pathology of many neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adult Neurogenesis Conserves Hippocampal Memory Capacity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6854?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is crucial for declarative memories in humans and encodes episodic and spatial memories in animals. Memory coding strengthens synaptic efficacy via an LTP-like mechanism. Given that animals store memories of everyday experiences, the hippocampal circuit must have a mechanism that prevents saturation of overall synaptic weight for the preservation of learning capacity. LTD works to balance plasticity and prevent saturation. In addition, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is proposed to be involved in the down-scaling of synaptic efficacy. Here, we show that adult neurogenesis in male rats plays a crucial role in the maintenance of hippocampal capacity for memory (learning and/or memory formation). Neurogenesis regulated the maintenance of LTP, with decreases and increases in neurogenesis prolonging or shortening LTP persistence, respectively. Artificial saturation of hippocampal LTP impaired memory capacity in contextual fear conditioning, which completely recovered after 14 d, which was the time required for LTP to decay to the basal level. Memory capacity gradually recovered in parallel with neurogenesis-mediated gradual decay of LTP. Ablation of neurogenesis by x-ray irradiation delayed the recovery of memory capacity, whereas enhancement of neurogenesis using a running wheel sped up recovery. Therefore, one benefit of ongoing adult neurogenesis is the maintenance of hippocampal memory capacity through homeostatic renewing of hippocampal memory circuits. Decreased neurogenesis in aged animals may be responsible for the decline in cognitive function with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning many events each day increases synaptic efficacy via LTP, which can prevent the storage of new memories in the hippocampal circuit. In this study, we demonstrate that hippocampal capacity for the storage of new memories is maintained by ongoing adult neurogenesis through homoeostatic renewing of hippocampal circuits in rats. A decrease or an increase in neurogenesis, respectively, delayed or sped up the recovery of memory capacity, suggesting that hippocampal adult neurogenesis plays a critical role in reducing LTP saturation and keeps the gate open for new memories by clearing out the old memories from the hippocampal memory circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Challenges to Body Fluid Homeostasis Differentially Recruit Phasic Dopamine Signaling in a Taste-Selective Manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6841?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The internal environment of an organism must remain stable to ensure optimal performance and ultimately survival. The generation of motivated behaviors is an adaptive mechanism for defending homeostasis. Although physiological state modulates motivated behaviors, the influence of physiological state on phasic dopamine signaling, an underlying neurobiological substrate of reward-driven behavior, is underexplored. Here, we use sodium depletion and water restriction, manipulations of body fluid homeostasis, to determine the flexibility and specificity of dopamine responses. Changes in dopamine concentration were measured using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the nucleus accumbens shell of male rats in response to intraoral infusions of fluids that either satisfied or did not satisfy homeostatic need. Increases in dopamine concentration during intraoral infusions were observed only under conditions of physiological deficit. Furthermore, dopamine increases were selective and limited to those that satisfied the need state of the animal. Thus, dopamine neurons track fluid balance and respond to salt and water stimuli in a state- and taste-dependent manner. Using Fluoro-Gold tracing and immunohistochemistry for c-Fos and Foxp2, a marker of sodium-deprivation responsive neurons, we revealed brainstem populations of neurons that are activated by sodium depletion and project directly to the ventral tegmental area. The identified projections may modulate dopamine neuron excitability and consequently the state-specific dopamine release observed in our experiments. This work illustrates the impact of physiological state on mesolimbic dopamine signaling and a potential circuit by which homeostatic disruptions are communicated to mesolimbic circuitry to drive the selective reinforcement of biologically-required stimuli under conditions of physiological need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motivated behaviors arise during physiological need and are highly selective for homeostasis-restoring stimuli. Although phasic dopamine signaling has been shown to contribute to the generation of motivated behaviors, the state and stimulus specificity of phasic dopamine signaling is less clear. These studies use thirst and sodium appetite to show that dopamine neurons dynamically track body fluid homeostasis and respond to water and salt stimuli in a state- and taste-dependent manner. We also identify hindbrain sodium deprivation-responsive neurons that project directly to the ventral tegmental area, where dopamine neuron cell bodies reside. This work demonstrates command of homeostasis over dopamine signaling and proposes a circuit by which physiological need drives motivated behavior by state- and taste-selective recruitment of phasic dopamine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Preconditioning Requires the Mitophagic Activity of C-terminus of HSC70-Interacting Protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6825?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/31/6825?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP, &lt;i&gt;STUB1&lt;/i&gt;) is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic E3-ubiquitin ligase. CHIP-deficient mice exhibit cardiovascular stress and motor dysfunction before premature death. This phenotype is more consistent with animal models in which master regulators of autophagy are affected rather than with the mild phenotype of classic E3-ubiquitin ligase mutants. The cellular and biochemical events that contribute to neurodegeneration and premature aging in CHIP KO models remain poorly understood. Electron and fluorescent microscopy demonstrates that CHIP deficiency is associated with greater numbers of mitochondria, but these organelles are swollen and misshapen. Acute bioenergetic stress triggers CHIP induction and relocalization to mitochondria, where it plays a role in the removal of damaged organelles. This mitochondrial clearance is required for protection following low-level bioenergetic stress in neurons. CHIP expression overlaps with stabilization of the redox stress sensor PTEN-inducible kinase 1 (PINK1) and is associated with increased LC3-mediated mitophagy. Introducing human promoter-driven vectors with mutations in either the E3 ligase or tetracopeptide repeat domains of CHIP in primary neurons derived from CHIP-null animals enhances CHIP accumulation at mitochondria. Exposure to autophagy inhibitors suggests that the increase in mitochondrial CHIP is likely due to diminished clearance of these CHIP-tagged organelles. Proteomic analysis of WT and CHIP KO mouse brains (four male, four female per genotype) reveals proteins essential for maintaining energetic, redox, and mitochondrial homeostasis undergo significant genotype-dependent expression changes. Together, these data support the use of CHIP-deficient animals as a predictive model of age-related degeneration with selective neuronal proteotoxicity and mitochondrial failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondria are recognized as central determinants of neuronal function and survival. We demonstrate that C terminus of HSC70-Interacting Protein (CHIP) is critical for neuronal responses to stress. CHIP upregulation and localization to mitochondria is required for mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Unlike other disease-associated E3 ligases such as Parkin and Mahogunin, CHIP controls homeostatic and stress-induced removal of mitochondria. Although CHIP deletion results in greater numbers of mitochondria, these organelles have distorted inner membranes without clear cristae. Neuronal cultures derived from animals lacking CHIP are more vulnerable to acute injuries and transient loss of CHIP renders neurons incapable of mounting a protective response after low-level stress. Together, these data suggest that CHIP is an essential regulator of mitochondrial number, cell signaling, and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Neuroregenerative Capacity of Olfactory Stem Cells Is Not Limitless: Implications for Aging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory epithelium (OE) of vertebrates is a highly regenerative neuroepithelium that is maintained under normal conditions by a population of stem and progenitor cells, globose basal cells (GBCs), which also contribute to epithelial reconstitution after injury. However, aging of the OE often leads to neurogenic exhaustion, the disappearance of both GBCs and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Aneuronal tissue may remain as olfactory, with an uninterrupted sheet of apically arrayed microvillar-capped sustentacular cell, or may undergo respiratory metaplasia. We have generated a transgenic mouse model for neurogenic exhaustion using olfactory marker protein-driven Tet-off regulation of the A subunit of &lt;i&gt;Diphtheria&lt;/i&gt; toxin such that the death of mature OSNs is accelerated. At as early as 2 months of age, the epithelium of transgenic mice, regardless of sex, recapitulates what is seen in the aged OE of humans and rodents. Areas of the epithelium completely lack neurons and GBCs; whereas the horizontal basal cells, a reserve stem cell population, show no evidence of activation. Surprisingly, other areas that were olfactory undergo respiratory metaplasia. The impact of accelerated neuronal death and reduced innervation on the olfactory bulb (OB) was also examined. Constant neuronal turnover leaves glomeruli shrunken and affects the dopaminergic interneurons in the periglomerular layer. Moreover, the acceleration of OSN death can be reversed in those areas where some GBCs persist. However, the projection onto the OB recovers incompletely and the reinnervated glomeruli are markedly altered. Therefore, the capacity for OE regeneration is tempered when GBCs disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A large percentage of humans lose or suffer a significant decline in olfactory function as they age. Therefore, quality of life suffers and safety and nutritional status are put at risk. With age, the OE apparently becomes incapable of fully maintaining the neuronal population of the epithelium despite its well known capacity for recovering from most forms of injury when younger. Efforts to identify the mechanism by which olfactory neurogenesis becomes exhausted with age require a powerful model for accelerating age-related tissue pathology. The current &lt;i&gt;OMP-tTA&lt;/i&gt;;&lt;i&gt;TetO-DTA&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mouse model, in which olfactory neurons die when they reach maturity and accelerated death can be aborted to assess the capacity for structural recovery, satisfies that need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;From interacting cellular components to networks of neurons and neural
systems, interconnected units comprise a fundamental organizing principle of
the nervous system. Understanding how their patterns of connections and
interactions give rise to the many functions of the nervous system is a primary
goal of neuroscience. Recently, this pursuit has begun to benefit from the
development of new mathematical tools that can relate a system's architecture
to its dynamics and function. These tools, which are known collectively as
network science, have been used with increasing success to build models of
neural systems across spatial scales and species. Here we discuss the nature of
network models in neuroscience. We begin with a review of model theory from a
philosophical perspective to inform our view of networks as models of complex
systems in general, and of the brain in particular. We then summarize the types
of models that are frequently studied in network neuroscience along three
primary dimensions: from data representations to first-principles theory, from
biophysical realism to functional phenomenology, and from elementary
descriptions to coarse-grained approximations. We then consider ways to
validate these models, focusing on approaches that perturb a system to probe
its function. We close with a description of important frontiers in the
construction of network models and their relevance for understanding
increasingly complex functions of neural systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To learn how cognition is implemented in the brain, we must build
computational models that can perform cognitive tasks, and test such models
with brain and behavioral experiments. Cognitive science has developed
computational models of human cognition, decomposing task performance into
computational components. However, its algorithms still fall short of human
intelligence and are not grounded in neurobiology. Computational neuroscience
has investigated how interacting neurons can implement component functions of
brain computation. However, it has yet to explain how those components interact
to explain human cognition and behavior. Modern technologies enable us to
measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals
and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when
employed to test brain-computational models. It is time to assemble the pieces
of the puzzle of brain computation. Here we review recent work in the
intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial
intelligence. Computational models that mimic brain information processing
during perceptual, cognitive, and control tasks are beginning to be developed
and tested with brain and behavioral data.

	<description>In 1984, biochemists George Glenner and Caine Wong, in search of ‘a unique amyloid fibril precursor protein in the serum’ of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, successfully isolated and sequenced the first 24 amino acids of a ‘cerebrovascular amyloid fibril protein β’ that we now know as the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. This landmark paper laid the foundation for extensive research in the following decades that ultimately established the role of β-amyloidosis as a player in the pathogenesis of AD.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Farzaneh Mohajerani, Michael F. Hagan&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial microcompartments are large, roughly icosahedral shells that assemble around enzymes and reactants involved in certain metabolic pathways in bacteria. Motivated by microcompartment assembly, we use coarse-grained computational and theoretical modeling to study the factors that control the size and morphology of a protein shell assembling around hundreds to thousands of molecules. We perform dynamical simulations of shell assembly in the presence and absence of cargo over a range of interaction strengths, subunit and cargo stoichiometries, and the shell spontaneous curvature. Depending on these parameters, we find that the presence of a cargo can either increase or decrease the size of a shell relative to its intrinsic spontaneous curvature, as seen in recent experiments. These features are controlled by a balance of kinetic and thermodynamic effects, and the shell size is assembly pathway dependent. We discuss implications of these results for synthetic biology efforts to target new enzymes to microcompartment interiors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VqXYLlYSdr8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Individual Differences in Motor Noise and Adaptation Rate Are Optimally Related</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or &quot;motor noise&quot; in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components that relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate, and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = 0.44; 95% HDI = [0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = –0.39; 95% HDI = [–0.50 –0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54; 95% HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the &quot;optimal control&quot; framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Nausea-Induced 5-HT Release in the Interoceptive Insular Cortex and Regulation by Monoacylglycerol Lipase (MAGL) Inhibition and Cannabidiol</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Using the rat conditioned gaping model of nausea, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC) has been identified as a critical site for the regulation of lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced nausea. Indirect evidence supports a model where serotonin (5-HT) acts on postsynaptic 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and its release is suppressed by elevating 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition to suppress nausea. Here, we directly test the hypothesis that systemic LiCl elevates 5-HT in the IIC, and this is prevented by pretreatments that reduce 5-HT release. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, LiCl (but not saline), elevated 5-HT selectively in the IIC, for 20 min after LiCl administration (127.2 mg/kg, i.p.). Systemic pretreatment with the MAGL inhibitor, MJN110, prevented the LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Systemic cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces LiCl-induced nausea by acting at 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; somatodendritic autoreceptors, also prevented LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Since 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists delivered to the IIC produce nausea, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that the intra-IIC administration of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist, ondansetron, but not MJN110, would prevent LiCl-induced conditioned gaping reactions produced by intra-IIC administration of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist, &lt;i&gt;m-&lt;/i&gt;chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to a LiCl-paired flavor (but not a saline-paired flavor) produces elevated 5-HT release in the IIC, while rats display conditioned gaping reactions. These results confirm that LiCl-induced nausea is triggered by elevated 5-HT release in the IIC and is attenuated by treatments that reduce 5-HT availability in this region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Maternal Regulation of Pups Cortical Activity: Role of Serotonergic Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A developing brain shows intense reorganization and heightened neuronal plasticity allowing for environmental modulation of its development. During early life, maternal care is a key factor of this environment and defects in this care can derail adaptive brain development and may result in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which those maternal interactions immediately impact the offspring’s brain activity to initiate the pathway to pathology are not well understood. We do know that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved, including the serotonergic system, a key neuromodulator involved in brain development and emotional regulation. We tested the importance of the serotonergic system and pups’ immediate neural response to maternal presence using wireless electrophysiological recordings, a novel approach allowing us to record neural activity during pups’ interactions with their mother. We found that maternal contact modulates the P10–P12 rat pups’ anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity by notably increasing local-field potential (LFP) power in low-frequency bands. We demonstrated, by blocking serotonergic receptors, that this increase is mediated through 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs). Finally, we showed in isolated pups that enhancing serotonergic transmission, using a selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor, is sufficient to enhance LFP power in low-frequency bands in a pattern similar to that observed when the mother is in the nest. Our results highlight a significant contribution of the serotonergic system in mediating changes of cortical activity in pups related to maternal presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Kv2.1 exhibits two distinct forms of localization patterns on the neuronal plasma membrane: One population is freely diffusive and regulates electrical activity via voltage-dependent K+ conductance while a second one localizes to micrometer-sized clusters that contain densely packed, but nonconducting, channels. We have previously established that these clusters represent endoplasmic...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/ZwuBck5-AKA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) form nanoscale pores across target membranes causing cell death. Cytolysin A (ClyA) from Escherichia coli is a prototypical α-helical toxin that contributes to cytolytic phenotype of several pathogenic strains. It is produced as a monomer and, upon membrane exposure, undergoes conformational changes and finally oligomerizes to form...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/8HETCpoc5nM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The functions of RNA pseudoknots (PKs), which are minimal tertiary structural motifs and an integral part of several ribozymes and ribonucleoprotein complexes, are determined by their structure, stability, and dynamics. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the general principles governing their thermodynamics/folding mechanisms. Here, we combine laser temperature-jump experiments and...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/cwzdgA0579Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Upon activation, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylates tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail, which triggers the binding of Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains and initiates downstream signaling. The sequences flanking the tyrosine residues (referred to as “phosphosites”) must be compatible with phosphorylation by the EGFR...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/MJDCk0Hm0o4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The recruitment and evolutionary optimization of promiscuous enzymes is key to the rapid adaptation of organisms to changing environments. Our understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying enzyme repurposing is, however, limited: What are the active-site features that enable the molecular recognition of multiple substrates with contrasting catalytic requirements?

	<description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional small molecules that simultaneously bind to a target protein and an E3 ligase, thereby leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target. They present an exciting opportunity to modulate proteins in a manner independent of enzymatic or signaling activity. As such, they have...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/gzUR7qiGY2A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>A summary genetic measure, called a “polygenic score,” derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of education can modestly predict a person’s educational and economic success. This prediction could signal a biological mechanism: Education-linked genetics could encode characteristics that help people get ahead in life.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modeling Human Decision-making: An Overview of the Brussels Quantum Approach. (arXiv:1807.11036v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11036</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11036</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present the fundamentals of the quantum theoretical approach we have
developed in the last decade to model cognitive phenomena that resisted
modeling by means of classical logical and probabilistic structures, like
Boolean, Kolmogorovian and, more generally, set theoretical structures. We
firstly sketch the operational-realistic foundations of conceptual entities,
i.e. concepts, conceptual combinations, propositions, decision-making entities,
etc. Then, we briefly illustrate the application of the quantum formalism in
Hilbert space to represent combinations of natural concepts, discussing its
success in modeling a wide range of empirical data on concepts and their
conjunction, disjunction and negation. Next, we naturally extend the quantum
theoretical approach to model some long-standing `fallacies of human
reasoning', namely, the `conjunction fallacy' and the `disjunction effect'.
Finally, we put forward an explanatory hypothesis according to which human
reasoning is a defined superposition of `emergent reasoning' and `logical
reasoning', where the former generally prevails over the latter. The quantum
theoretical approach explains human fallacies as the consequence of genuine
quantum structures in human reasoning, i.e. `contextuality', `emergence',
`entanglement', `interference' and `superposition'. As such, it is alternative
to the Kahneman-Tversky research programme, which instead aims to explain human
fallacies in terms of `individual heuristics and biases'.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Revealing a Cortical Circuit Responsive to Predatory Threats and Mediating Contextual Fear Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ventral part of the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AMv) receives substantial inputs from hypothalamic sites that are highly responsive to a live predator or its odor trace and represents an important thalamic hub for conveying predatory threat information to the cerebral cortex. In the present study, we begin by examining the cortico-amygdalar-hippocampal projections of the main AMv cortical targets, namely, the caudal prelimbic, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial visual areas, as well as the rostral part of the ventral retrosplenial area, one of the main targets of the anterior cingulate area. We observed that these areas form a clear cortical network. Next, we revealed that in animals exposed to a live cat, all of the elements of this circuit presented a differential increase in Fos, supporting the idea of a predator threat-responsive cortical network. Finally, we showed that bilateral cytotoxic lesions in each element of this cortical network did not change innate fear responses but drastically reduced contextual conditioning to the predator-associated environment. Overall, the present findings suggest that predator threat has an extensive representation in the cerebral cortex and revealed a cortical network that is responsive to predatory threats and exerts a critical role in processing fear memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Interrogating the Relationship Between Schizotypy, the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met Polymorphism, and Neuronal Oscillatory Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism affects the availability of synaptic dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and has been widely studied as a genetic risk factor for psychosis. Schizotypy is associated with an increased risk of psychosis, with some studies implicating similar neurobiological mechanisms to schizophrenia. The present study sought to interrogate the link between the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism and schizotypy using electroencephalogram (EEG) to identify neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning psychosis risk. Neurotypical (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 91) adults were genotyped for the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism, completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), and had eyes open resting-state EEG recorded for 4 min. SPQ suspiciousness subscale scores were higher for individuals homozygous for Val/Val and Met/Met versus Val/Met genotypes. Delta, theta, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 amplitudes were lower for Val/Val than Met/Met individuals. Lower theta amplitudes were correlated with higher total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.050), and multiple regression revealed that higher delta, and lower theta and beta-2 amplitudes (but not &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype) best predicted total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014). This study demonstrates the importance of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype in determining trait suspiciousness and EEG oscillatory activity. It also highlights relationships between dopaminergic alterations, EEG and schizotypy that are dissimilar to those observed in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although frequently discussed in terms of sex dimorphism, the neurobiology of sexual orientation and identity is unknown. We report multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data, including cortical thickness (Cth), subcortical volumes, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, from 27 transgender women (TrW), 40 transgender men (TrM), and 80 heterosexual (40 men) and 60 homosexual cisgender controls (30 men). These data show that whereas homosexuality is linked to cerebral sex dimorphism, gender dysphoria primarily involves cerebral networks mediating self–body perception. Among the homosexual cisgender controls, weaker sex dimorphism was found in white matter connections and a partly reversed sex dimorphism in Cth. Similar patterns were detected in transgender persons compared with heterosexual cisgender controls, but the significant clusters disappeared when adding homosexual controls, and correcting for sexual orientation. Instead, both TrW and TrM displayed singular features, showing greater Cth as well as weaker structural and functional connections in the anterior cingulate-precuneus and right occipito-parietal cortex, regions known to process own body perception in the context of self.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Selective attention is central to cognition. Dramatic advances have been made in understanding the neural circuits that mediate selective attention. Forebrain networks, most elaborated in primates, control all forms of attention based on task demands and the physical salience of stimuli. These networks contain circuits that distribute top-down signals to sensory processing areas and enhance information processing in those areas. A midbrain network, most elaborated in birds, controls spatial attention.</description>

The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PSYkmktapmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inter-trial effects in visual pop-out search: Factorial comparison of Bayesian updating models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Fredrik Allenmark, Hermann J. Müller, Zhuanghua Shi&lt;/p&gt;

Many previous studies on visual search have reported inter-trial effects, that is, observers respond faster when some target property, such as a defining feature or dimension, or the response associated with the target repeats versus changes across consecutive trial episodes. However, what processes drive these inter-trial effects is still controversial. Here, we investigated this question using a combination of Bayesian modeling of belief updating and evidence accumulation modeling in perceptual decision-making. In three visual singleton (‘pop-out’) search experiments, we explored how the probability of the response-critical states of the search display (e.g., target presence/absence) and the repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension (color/ orientation) affect reaction time distributions. The results replicated the mean reaction time (RT) inter-trial and dimension repetition/switch effects that have been reported in previous studies. Going beyond this, to uncover the underlying mechanisms, we used the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) and the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate (LATER) model to explain the RT distributions in terms of decision bias (starting point) and information processing speed (evidence accumulation rate). We further investigated how these different aspects of the decision-making process are affected by different properties of stimulus history, giving rise to dissociable inter-trial effects. We approached this question by (i) combining each perceptual decision making model (DDM or LATER) with different updating models, each specifying a plausible rule for updating of either the starting point or the rate, based on stimulus history, and (ii) comparing every possible combination of trial-wise updating mechanism and perceptual decision model in a factorial model comparison. Consistently across experiments, we found that the (recent) history of the response-critical property influences the initial decision bias, while repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension affects the accumulation rate, likely reflecting an implicit ‘top-down’ modulation process. This provides strong evidence of a disassociation between response- and dimension-based inter-trial effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0rQcDnT9JDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Wakefulness is promoted during daytime by PDFR signalling to dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using down-regulation or over-expression of the gene encoding PDF receptor (&lt;i&gt;pdfr&lt;/i&gt;), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons respond to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (s-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day-time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during daytime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is well established that sleep is controlled by two major factors, the circadian clock as well as a sleep homeostat. Organisms need to remain awake during appropriate times of the day in order to engage in activities such as feeding and mating that increase their chances of survival. How wakefulness during the day is maintained remains unknown. Here, we show that circadian clock neurons direct their inhibitory peptidergic wake-promoting signal to dopamine neurons specifically during the day-time. Importantly, contact of dopamine neurons with known homeostatic structures established through previous studies, underlies an important pathway bridging together circadian and homeostatic neurons in sleep/wake regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation to inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using novel quantitative analyses of spontaneous synaptic currents in L2/3 pyramidal cells, we revealed subtle deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) in a new mouse model of AD, the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We applied novel statistical and analytical methods to further characterize the properties of spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Our approach provides rigorous quantitative tools for the analysis of synaptic events in mouse models of disease for objectively and reliably revealing even subtle disease-related alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Nausea-Induced 5-HT Release in the Interoceptive Insular Cortex and Regulation by Monoacylglycerol Lipase (MAGL) Inhibition and Cannabidiol</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Using the rat conditioned gaping model of nausea, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC) has been identified as a critical site for the regulation of lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced nausea. Indirect evidence supports a model where serotonin (5-HT) acts on post-synaptic 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and its release is suppressed by elevating 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition to suppress nausea. Here we directly test the hypothesis that systemic LiCl elevates 5-HT in the IIC and this is prevented by pretreatments that reduce 5-HT release. Using male Sprague-Dawley rats, LiCl (but not saline), elevated 5-HT selectively in the IIC, for 20 min after LiCl administration (127.2 mg/kg, ip). Systemic pretreatment with the MAGL inhibitor, MJN110, prevented the LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Systemic cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces LiCl-induced nausea by acting at 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; somatodendritic autoreceptors, also prevented LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Since 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists delivered to the IIC produce nausea, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that, the intra-IIC administration of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist, ondansetron, but not MJN110, would prevent LiCl-induced conditioned gaping reactions produced by intra-IIC administration of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist, &lt;i&gt;m-&lt;/i&gt;chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to a LiCl-paired flavor (but not a saline-paired flavor), produces elevated 5-HT release in the IIC, while rats display conditioned gaping reactions. These results confirm that LiCl-induced nausea is triggered by elevated 5-HT release in the IIC and is attenuated by treatments that reduce 5-HT availability in this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding of the neurobiology of nausea has lagged behind that of the neurobiology of vomiting. Here we demonstrate for the first time that a nauseating drug produces an elevation of serotonin in the brain region that mediates nausea in humans, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC). This elevated serotonin (and nausea) is prevented by pretreatment with a drug that elevates the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG), in this region. As well, pretreatment with the non-psychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidol, acts to reduce forebrain release of serotonin (and nausea) triggered by the nauseating drug. These results strongly suggest serotonin serves as a trigger to produce the sensation of nausea in the IIC and cannabinoids act to prevent this trigger to regulate nausea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: ApoE Regulates the Development of Adult Newborn Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and is believed to participate in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A number of genes that regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified, though most of these have been implicated in progenitor proliferation and survival, but not on the development into fully differentiated neurons. Among these genes, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is particularly compelling because the human ApoE isoform, E4, is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease where hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be dysfunctional. To investigate the effects of ApoE and its human isoforms on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal development, retroviruses carrying a GFP-expressing vector were injected into wildtype (WT), ApoE-deficient, and human targeted-replacement (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice to infect progenitors in the dentate gyrus and analyze the morphology of fully developed GFP-expressing neurons. Analysis of these adult-born neurons revealed significant decreases in the complexity of dendritic arborizations and spine density in ApoE-deficient mice compared to wildtype, as well as in ApoE4 mice compared to ApoE3. These findings demonstrate that ApoE deficiency and the ApoE4 human isoform both impair hippocampal neurogenesis and give insight into how ApoE may influence hippocampal-related neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Apolipoprotein E is known to regulate postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus by directly affecting the proliferation of early progenitor cells. We found reduced complexity of adult-born granule cell dendritic arborizations as well as reduced spine density in ApoE-deficient and ApoE4 mice dentate gyrus neurons. These results provide strong evidence of impaired development of adult-born neurons in ApoE-deficient and ApoE4 mouse hippocampus, which may help explain the higher risk of hippocampal-related neuropsychiatric diseases in humans carrying the E4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;β-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), one of the major pathogenic molecules of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and is therefore being actively pursued as a drug target for AD. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a lifelong process that is known to be important for learning and memory and may have the potential to regenerate damaged neural tissue. In this study, we examined whether BACE1 regulates AHN, which holds important implications for its suitability as a drug target in AD. Cohorts of 2-month-old wild-type (BACE1+/+), heterozygous, and homozygous BACE1 knockout mice (BACE1+/- and BACE1-/-, respectively) were injected with BrdU and sacrificed 1 day later to examine the impact of loss of BACE1 on neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation in the adult brain. Parallel cohorts of mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after BrdU injection to determine the effects of BACE1 on survival and differentiation of newborn NPCs. We found that NPC proliferation was increased in BACE1-/- mice compared to BACE1+/+ mice, while no difference was observed in NPC survival across genotypes. Differentiation of NPCs to neuronal lineage was impaired in BACE1-/- mice. However, no differences were observed in astrogenesis, in the proportion of immature neurons, or in the production of oligodendrocytes across genotypes. Importantly, corresponding with a decrease in neuronal differentiation in the absence of a complementary increase in an alternate cell fate, BACE1-/- mice were found to have a pool of undifferentiated NPCs in the hippocampus compared to BACE1+/+ and BACE1+/- mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The present findings not only demonstrate that BACE1 regulates AHN, but also raise a note of caution that therapeutic inhibition of its enzymatic activity might have potential to produce a pool of adult-generated undifferentiated cells in the hippocampus. Our data strongly suggest that the complete loss of BACE1 activity dysregulates AHN in the adult mouse hippocampus. Alternatively, partial inhibition of BACE1 activity, e.g. in BACE1± mice, may mirror a more suitable therapeutic approach that would not impact AHN or NPC differentiation, for when BACE1 inhibition is being pursued as an effective means of lowering Aβ levels in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Visual Temporal Contrast Sensitivity in the Behaving Mouse Shares Fundamental Properties with Human Psychophysics</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system has a remarkable capacity to detect differences in contrast across time, known as temporal contrast sensitivity (TCS). Details of the underlying neural mechanisms are rapidly emerging as a result of a series of elegant electrophysiological studies performed largely with mouse as an experimental model. However rigorous psychophysical methods are necessary to pair the electrophysiology with temporal visual behavior in mouse. The optomotor response is frequently used as a proxy for retinal temporal processing in rodents. However, subcortical reflexive pathways drive the optomotor response rather than cortical and decision-making areas. To address this problem, we have developed an operant behavior assay that measures temporal contrast sensitivity in behaving mice. Mice were trained to perform a forced-choice visual task and tested daily their ability to distinguish flickering from non-flickering overhead lights. Correct responses (Hit and Correct Rejections) were rewarded. Contrast, temporal frequency and mean illumination of the flicker were the independent variables. We validated and applied the Theory of Signal Detection (TSD) to estimate the discriminability factor d’, a measure of performance that is independent of response bias and motivation. The empirical contrast threshold was defined as the contrast necessary to elicit a d’ = 1 and TCS as the inverse of the contrast threshold. With this approach we established in mouse a model of human vision that shares fundamental properties of human temporal psychophysics such as Weber adaptation in response to low temporal frequency flicker and illumination-dependent increases in Critical Flicker Frequency as predicted by Ferry-Porter’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Rigorous psychophysical methods are necessary to pair the power of mouse genetics and electrophysiological studies with temporal visual behavior using mouse as an experimental model. To address this problem, we have developed an operant behavior assay that measures TCS in mice. Our assay is based on a forced-choice alternative response protocol and applies the Theory of Signal Detection to generate an unbiased measure of sensitivity. With this approach, we measured TCS and established in mouse a model of human vision that shares fundamental properties of human temporal psychophysics. This finding fills in a major gap in our knowledge that is of general interest to the visual science community studying retinal and central visual processing using mouse as an experimental model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: AhR Deletion Promotes Aberrant Morphogenesis and Synaptic Activity of Adult-Generated Granule Neurons and Impairs Hippocampus-Dependent Memory</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Newborn granule cells are continuously produced in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus throughout life. Once these cells mature, they integrate into pre-existing circuits modulating hippocampus-dependent memory. Subsequently, mechanisms controlling generation and maturation of newborn cells are essential for proper hippocampal function. Therefore, we have studied the role of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated bHLH-PAS transcription factor, in hippocampus-dependent memory and granule neuronal morphology and function using genetic loss-of-function approaches based on constitutive and inducible-nestin AhR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The results presented here show that the impaired hippocampus-dependent memory in AhR absence is not due to its effects on neurogenesis but to aberrant dendritic arborisation and to an increased spine density albeit with a lower number of mature mushrooms spines in newborn granule cells, a finding that is associated to an immature electrophysiological phenotype. Together, our data strongly suggest that AhR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hippocampal function, by controlling hippocampal granule neuron morphology and synaptic maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Hippocampus-dependent memory depends on the generation and maturation of dentate gyrus (DG) newborn granule cells. Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated bHLH-PAS transcription factor recently implicated in dendrite branching in the CNS. Since its role in the modulation of dendrite branching and plasticity of adult hippocampal newborn granule neurons and subsequent impact on hippocampus-dependent memory remains unknown, we have undertaken its study using genetic loss-of-function approaches in adult mice. Our study provides evidence indicating that AhR is a regulator of dendrite arborisation and proper synaptic maturation of adult hippocampal newborn neurons and showing its critical role for learning and memory function. These findings point out AhR as a new potent druggable target for the treatment of several cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Searching for a target object in a cluttered scene constitutes a fundamental
challenge in daily vision. Visual search must be selective enough to
discriminate the target from distractors, invariant to changes in the
appearance of the target, efficient to avoid exhaustive exploration of the
image, and must generalize to locate novel target objects with zero-shot
training. Previous work has focused on searching for perfect matches of a
target after extensive category-specific training. Here we show for the first
time that humans can efficiently and invariantly search for natural objects in
complex scenes. To gain insight into the mechanisms that guide visual search,
we propose a biologically inspired computational model that can locate targets
without exhaustive sampling and generalize to novel objects. The model provides
an approximation to the mechanisms integrating bottom-up and top-down signals
during search in natural scenes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis considered here is that cognition is based on a small set of
systems-level computational primitives that are defined at a level higher than
single neurons. It is pointed out that for one such set of primitives, whose
quantitative effectiveness has been demonstrated by analysis and computer
simulation, emerging technologies for stimulation and recording are making it
possible to test directly whether cortex is capable of performing them.

These behavioral responses are thought to be largely driven by genetically pre-programmed circuits. However, they can also vary significantly according to the animal’s previous social experience and physiological state, suggesting that the underlying circuits are shaped by adaptive modulatory changes. Modern tools of neuroscience have enabled the direct interrogation of circuits driving sex-specific behaviors and helped unravel key neural mechanisms underlying their function and modulation. In particular, recent work has shown how individual neuronal responses may combine with population activity to encode specific social information in both sexes. In this review, we summarize recent findings on how sex-specific sensory information is processed in social behavioral circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Activation of the DNA-repair mechanism through NBS1 and MRE11 diffusion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ida Friis, Ilia A. Solov’yov&lt;/p&gt;

The non-homologous end joining of a DNA double strand break is initiated by the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 complex whose subunits are the first three proteins to arrive to the breakage site thereby making the recruitment time of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50 essential for cell survival. In the present investigation, the nature of MRE11 and NBS1 transportation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, hosting the damaged DNA strand, is hypothesized to be a passive diffusive process. The feasibility of such a mechanism is addressed through theoretical and computational approaches which permit establishing the characteristic recruitment time of MRE11 and NBS1 by the nucleus. A computational model of a cell is constructed from a set of biological parameters and the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the diffusing MRE11 and NBS1 particles as a random walk process. To accurately describe the experimented data, it is discovered that MRE11 and NBS1 should start diffusion from significantly different starting positions which suggests that diffusion might not be the only transport mechanism of repair protein recruitment to the DNA break.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Goom-28bvCg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian comparison of explicit and implicit causal inference strategies in multisensory heading perception</title>

The precision of multisensory perception improves when cues arising from the same cause are integrated, such as visual and vestibular heading cues for an observer moving through a stationary environment. In order to determine how the cues should be processed, the brain must infer the causal relationship underlying the multisensory cues. In heading perception, however, it is unclear whether observers follow the Bayesian strategy, a simpler non-Bayesian heuristic, or even perform causal inference at all. We developed an efficient and robust computational framework to perform Bayesian model comparison of causal inference strategies, which incorporates a number of alternative assumptions about the observers. With this framework, we investigated whether human observers’ performance in an &lt;i&gt;explicit&lt;/i&gt; cause attribution and an &lt;i&gt;implicit&lt;/i&gt; heading discrimination task can be modeled as a causal inference process. In the explicit causal inference task, all subjects accounted for cue disparity when reporting judgments of common cause, although not necessarily all in a Bayesian fashion. By contrast, but in agreement with previous findings, data from the heading discrimination task only could not rule out that several of the same observers were adopting a forced-fusion strategy, whereby cues are integrated regardless of disparity. Only when we combined evidence from both tasks we were able to rule out forced-fusion in the heading discrimination task. Crucially, findings were robust across a number of variants of models and analyses. Our results demonstrate that our proposed computational framework allows researchers to ask complex questions within a rigorous Bayesian framework that accounts for parameter and model uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZGcPnbf7Gpw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Microstructural White Matter Abnormalities in the Dorsal Cingulum of Adolescents with IBS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0354-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been considered to reflect microstructural white matter changes in disease conditions, however no study to date has examined white matter changes using diffusion tensor imaging in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of the present study was two-fold: 1) to determine whether differences in FA, and other non-FA metrics, were present in adolescents with IBS compared to healthy controls using a whole-brain analysis and a ROI-restricted tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and canonical ROI-based DTI analysis for the cingulum bundle, and 2) to determine if these metrics were related to clinical measures of disease duration and pain intensity in the IBS group. A total of 16 adolescents with a ROME III diagnosis of IBS (females = 12; mean age = 16.29, age range: 11.96-18.5 yrs) and 16 age- and gender-matched controls (females = 12; mean age = 16.24; age range: 11.71-20.32 yrs) participated in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens 3-T Trio Tim Syngo MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The ROI-restricted TBSS and canonical ROI-based DTI analyses revealed that adolescents with IBS showed decreased FA in the right dorsal cingulum bundle compared to controls. No relationship between FA and disease severity measures was found. Microstructural white matter alterations in the right dorsal cingulum bundle in adolescents with IBS may reflect the emergence of a premorbid brain state or a disease-driven process that results from complex changes in pain- and affect-related processing via spinothalamic and corticolimbic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the present study we observed white matter abnormalities indexed by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right dorsal cingulum in adolescents with IBS compared to a healthy cohort. However, this decrease in white matter FA was not related to disease severity measures. These findings represent the first report of white matter brain changes in an adolescent population with IBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Ripple oscillations in the left temporal neocortex are associated with impaired verbal episodic memory encoding. (arXiv:1807.10269v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10269</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10269</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: We sought to determine if ripple oscillations (80-120Hz),
detected in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of epilepsy patients, correlate
with an enhancement or disruption of verbal episodic memory encoding. Methods:
We defined ripple and spike events in depth iEEG recordings during list
learning in 107 patients with focal epilepsy. We used logistic regression
models (LRMs) to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of ripple
and spike events during word presentation and the odds of successful word
recall following a distractor epoch, and included the seizure onset zone (SOZ)
as a covariate in the LRMs. Results: We detected events during 58,312 word
presentation trials from 7,630 unique electrode sites. The probability of
ripple on spike (RonS) events was increased in the seizure onset zone (SOZ,
p&amp;lt;0.04). In the left temporal neocortex RonS events during word presentation
corresponded with a decrease in the odds ratio (OR) of successful recall,
however this effect only met significance in the SOZ (OR of word recall 0.71,
95% CI: 0.59-0.85, n=158 events, adaptive Hochberg p&amp;lt;0.01). Ripple on
oscillation events (RonO) that occurred in the left temporal neocortex non-SOZ
also correlated with decreased odds of successful recall (OR 0.52, 95% CI:
0.34-0.80, n=140, adaptive Hochberg , p&amp;lt;0.01). Spikes and RonS that occurred
during word presentation in the left middle temporal gyrus during word
presentation correlated with the most significant decrease in the odds of
successful recall, irrespective of the location of the SOZ (adaptive Hochberg,
p&amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion: Ripples and spikes generated in left temporal neocortex
are associated with impaired verbal episodic memory encoding.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A simple device for microinjections, manipulations and measurements using an electromorphological chip under microinterferometric control of the interface and membrane processes at the thickness range of 5-1000 nm at different angles. (arXiv:1807.10137v1 [q-bio.SC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Micromanipulations, perfusions and measurements performed using glass
microelectrodes filled with an electrolyte is a conventional technique for
experimental morphological and membrane electrophysiological studies at a
single cell and membrane surface level. The typical (effective) diameter of the
end of the glass microelectrode is from 500 up to less than 100 nm, which
prevents one from observing it using a standard optical microscope in
accordance with the optical resolution criteria, since the diameter less than
500 nm is indistinguishable within the interference zone. Microprocessor
programming of the puller (microforge) that provides pulling and tearing allows
to obtain in certain regimes the adjusted diameter and shape of the
micropipette tip, although this result is not fully controlled due to the above
limitations. In this connection it is necessary to design the control devices
for the micropipette tips both at the preparation and operation stages
(intracellular or extracellular insertion). This method also should provide
visualization of the processes occurring upon interaction of the microelectrode
tip with the cell in real time, depending on the electrode type and state,
which allows to level the artifacts arising with the systematic error frequency
from the uncontrolled operation of the micropipette tip after different ways of
the microelectrode filling with the electrolyte. We propose an installation
scheme that solves the above problems by means of introducing an
interferometric device for microscopic control of the microelectrode and
micromanipulator or microperfusor, for the first time for a given type of
optical instruments combined with the interferometric optical scheme.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of a recent study on the modeling of the information
coding in sensory system in the brain. The data from a sensory neurons are
available as discrete spike timings with no amplitude information. In the
simulations, these are generated from a data generator model which has certain
differences from the model being estimated. The model under consideration is
simpler than the one used as a data generator as it has no sigmoidal gain
function parameters. This choice is based on a suggestion from a recent study
which states that inclusion of gain functions to the estimation algorithm
increases issues such as parameter confounding which leads to performance
degradation issues like increased or unpredictable variance changes with
different stimuli configurations. To resolve this issue we consider a more
generic model that has no sigmoidal gain functions to be estimated. Like that
of the first research, we applied a Fourier series stimulus to both data
generator and the estimated network. In order to test the performance of the
proposed scheme, we have repeated the simulations with different sample sizes,
stimulus component counts, amplitude and base frequencies. Mean values of
estimation are presented as tables and the statistical analysis results are
presented in graphical forms. In addition, since we do not have any true
parameter data (for the estimated model) we compare the firing rate responses
of both data generator and estimated models to different stimuli. It appeared
that the responses of both models are almost the same.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: ACC Sulcal Patterns and Their Modulation on Cognitive Control Efficiency Across Lifespan: A Neuroanatomical Study on Bilinguals and Monolinguals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy175</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy175/5060274?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key structure implicated in the regulation of cognitive control (CC). Previous studies suggest that variability in the ACC sulcal pattern—a neurodevelopmental marker unaffected by maturation or plasticity after birth—is associated with intersubject differences in CC performance. Here, we investigated whether bilingual experience modulates the effects of ACC sulcal variability on CC performance across the lifespan. Using structural MRI, we first established the distribution of the ACC sulcal patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 270) differing on gender and ethnicity. Second, a participants’ subsample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 157) was selected to test whether CC performance was differentially affected by ACC sulcation in bilinguals and monolinguals across age. A prevalent leftward asymmetry unaffected by gender or ethnicity was reported. Sulcal variability in the ACC predicted CC performance differently in bilinguals and monolinguals, with a reversed pattern of structure–function relationship: asymmetrical versus symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns were associated with a performance advantage in monolinguals and a performance detriment to bilinguals and vice versa. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights on the dynamic interplay between early neurodevelopment, environmental background and cognitive efficiency across age.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Network Oscillations Rescue Memory Consolidation Deficits Caused by Sleep Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy174</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy174/5060282?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Oscillations in the hippocampal network during sleep are proposed to play a role in memory storage by patterning neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that following single-trial fear learning, sleep deprivation (which impairs memory consolidation) disrupts coherent firing rhythms in hippocampal area CA1. State-targeted optogenetic inhibition of CA1 parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons during postlearning NREM sleep, but not REM sleep or wake, disrupts contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation in a manner similar to sleep deprivation. NREM-targeted inhibition disrupts CA1 network oscillations which predict successful memory storage. Rhythmic optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons following learning generates CA1 oscillations with coherent principal neuron firing. This patterning of CA1 activity rescues CFM consolidation in sleep-deprived mice. Critically, behavioral and optogenetic manipulations that disrupt CFM also disrupt learning-induced stabilization of CA1 ensembles’ communication patterns in the hours following learning. Conversely, manipulations that promote CFM also promote long-term stability of CA1 communication patterns. We conclude that sleep promotes memory consolidation by generating coherent rhythms of CA1 network activity, which provide consistent communication patterns within neuronal ensembles. Most importantly, we show that this rhythmic patterning of activity is sufficient to promote long-term memory storage in the absence of sleep.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dynamic Reorganization of Motor Networks During Recovery from Partial Spinal Cord Injury in Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy172</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy172/5060284?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;After spinal cord injury (SCI), the motor-related cortical areas can be a potential substrate for functional recovery in addition to the spinal cord. However, a dynamic description of how motor cortical circuits reorganize after SCI is lacking. Here, we captured the comprehensive dynamics of motor networks across SCI in a nonhuman primate model. Using electrocorticography over the sensorimotor areas in monkeys, we collected broadband neuronal signals during a reaching-and-grasping task at different stages of recovery of dexterous finger movements after a partial SCI at the cervical levels. We identified two distinct network dynamics: grasping-related intrahemispheric interactions from the contralesional premotor cortex (PM) to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in the high-γ band (&amp;gt;70 Hz), and motor-preparation-related interhemispheric interactions from the contralesional to ipsilesional PM in the α and low-β bands (10–15 Hz). The strengths of these networks correlated to the time course of behavioral recovery. The grasping-related network showed enhanced activation immediately after the injury, but gradually returned to normal while the strength of the motor-preparation-related network gradually increased. Our findings suggest a cortical compensatory mechanism after SCI, where two interdependent motor networks redirect activity from the contralesional hemisphere to the other hemisphere to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Control Engagement During Sentence and Inhibition fMRI Tasks in Children With Reading Difficulties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy170</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy170/5060275?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent reading research implicates executive control regions as sites of difference in struggling readers. However, as studies often employ only reading or language tasks, the extent of deviation in control engagement in children with reading difficulties is not known. The current study investigated activation in reading and executive control brain regions during both a sentence comprehension task and a nonlexical inhibitory control task in third–fifth grade children with and without reading difficulties. We employed both categorical (group-based) and individual difference approaches to relate reading ability to brain activity. During sentence comprehension, struggling readers had less activation in the left posterior temporal cortex, previously implicated in language, semantic, and reading research. Greater negative activity (relative to fixation) during sentence comprehension in a left inferior parietal region from the executive control literature correlated with poorer reading ability. Greater comprehension scores were associated with less dorsal anterior cingulate activity during the sentence comprehension task. Unlike the sentence task, there were no significant differences between struggling and nonstruggling readers for the nonlexical inhibitory control task. Thus, differences in executive control engagement were largely specific to reading, rather than a general control deficit across tasks in children with reading difficulties, informing future intervention research.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Timing of Sensory-Guided Behavioral Response is Represented in
the Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy169</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy169/5060281?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Whisker-guided decision making in mice is thought to critically depend on
information processing occurring in the primary somatosensory cortex. However,
it is not clear if neuronal activity in this “early”
sensory region contains information about the timing and speed of motor
response. To address this question we designed a new task in which freely moving
mice learned to associate a whisker stimulus to reward delivery. The task was
tailored in such a way that a wide range of delays between whisker stimulation
and reward collection were observed due to differences of motivation and
perception. After training, mice were anesthetized and neuronal responses evoked
by stimulating trained and untrained whiskers were recorded across several
cortical columns of barrel cortex. We found a strong correlation between the
delay of the mouse behavioral response and the timing of multiunit activity
evoked by the trained whisker, outside its principal cortical column, in layers
4 and 5A but not in layer 2/3. Circuit mapping ex vivo revealed this effect was
associated with a weakening of layer 4 to layer 2/3 projection. We conclude that
the processes controlling the propagation of key sensory inputs to naive
cortical columns and the timing of sensory-guided action are linked.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Control Over Occipital Responses to Crossmodal Overlap Varies Across the Congruency Spectrum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy168</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy168/5060272?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While matched crossmodal information is known to facilitate object recognition, it is unclear how our perceptual systems encode the more gradual congruency variations that occur in our natural environment. Combining visual objects with odor mixtures to create a gradual increase in semantic object overlap, we demonstrate high behavioral acuity to linear variations of olfactory–visual overlap in a healthy adult population. This effect was paralleled by a linear increase in cortical activation at the intersection of occipital fusiform and lingual gyri, indicating linear encoding of crossmodal semantic overlap in visual object recognition networks. Effective connectivity analyses revealed that this integration of olfactory and visual information was achieved by direct information exchange between olfactory and visual areas. In addition, a parallel pathway through the superior frontal gyrus was increasingly recruited towards the most ambiguous stimuli. These findings demonstrate that cortical structures involved in object formation are inherently crossmodal and encode sensory overlap in a linear manner. The results further demonstrate that prefrontal control of these processes is likely required for ambiguous stimulus combinations, a fact of high ecological relevance that may be inappropriately captured by common task designs juxtaposing congruency and incongruency.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Role of the Default Mode Network in Cognitive Transitions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy167</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy167/5060278?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A frequently repeated finding is that the default mode network (DMN) shows activation decreases during externally focused tasks. This finding has led to an emphasis in DMN research on internally focused self-relevant thought processes. A recent study, in contrast, implicates the DMN in substantial externally focused task switches. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 24 participants performing a task switch experiment. Whilst replicating previous DMN task switch effects, we also found large DMN increases for brief rests as well as task restarts after rest. Our findings are difficult to explain using theories strictly linked to internal or self-directed cognition. In line with principal results from the literature, we suggest that the DMN encodes scene, episode or context, by integrating spatial, self-referential, and temporal information. Context representations are strong at rest, but rereference to context also occurs at major cognitive transitions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reward-Driven Arousal Impacts Preparation to Perform a Task via Amygdala–Caudate Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preparing for a challenging task can increase physiological arousal, in particular when potential incentives are large (e.g., a solo musical performance in front of an audience). Here, we examine how potential reward and its influence on arousal, measured by pupil dynamics, are represented in the brain while preparing for a challenging task. We further ask how neural representations during preparation relate to actual performance. Trials resulting in performance failure were characterized by increased pupil dilation as a function of increasing reward magnitude during preparation. Such failure trials were also associated with activation of the right amygdala representing pupil dilation, and the left caudate representing reward magnitude. Notably, increases in functional connectivity between amygdala and caudate preceded performance failure. These findings highlight increased connectivity between neural regions representing reward and arousal in circumstances where reward-driven arousal impairs performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder affecting muscle and central nervous system (CNS) function. The cellular mechanisms underlying CNS alterations are poorly understood and no useful treatments exist for the neuropsychological deficits observed in DM1 patients. We investigated the progression of behavioral deficits present in male and female muscleblind-like 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mbnl2&lt;/span&gt;) knockout (KO) mice, a rodent model of CNS alterations in DM1, and determined the biochemical and electrophysiological correlates in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum and hippocampus (HPC). Male KO exhibited more cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior than female KO mice. In the mPFC, KO mice showed an overexpression of proinflammatory microglia, increased transcriptional levels of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd1&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;, exacerbated dopamine levels, and abnormal neural spiking and oscillatory activities in the mPFC and HPC. Chronic treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) (1 and 3 mg/kg) reversed the behavioral deficits, reduced proinflammatory microglia in the mPFC, normalized prefrontal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt; gene expression, and increased &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bdnf&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nrf2&lt;/span&gt; mRNA levels. These findings unravel the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of MPH on cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviors observed in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mbnl2&lt;/span&gt; KO mice, and suggest that MPH could be a potential candidate to treat the CNS deficiencies in DM1 patients.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Evidence for a Posterior Parietal Cortex Contribution to Spatial but not Temporal Numerosity Perception</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to encode and represent the number of objects in a visual scene (i.e., numerosity). Whether this representation is shared for simultaneous and sequential stimuli (i.e., mode independency) is debated. We tested the existence of a common neural substrate for the encoding of these modes using fMRI. While both modes elicited overlapping BOLD response in occipital areas, only simultaneous numerosities significantly activated PPC. Unique activation for sequential numerosities was found in bilateral temporal areas. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed numerosity selectivity in PPC only for simultaneous numerosities and revealed differential encoding of presentation modes. Voxel-wise numerosity tuning functions for simultaneous numerosities in occipital and parietal ROIs revealed increasing numerosity selectivity along an occipito-to-parietal gradient. Our results suggest that the parietal cortex is involved in the extraction of spatial but not temporal numerosity and question the idea of commonly used cortical circuits for a mode-independent numerosity representation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Stress Impairs Episodic Retrieval by Disrupting Hippocampal and Cortical Mechanisms of Remembering</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Despite decades of science investigating the neural underpinnings of episodic memory retrieval, a critical question remains: how does stress influence remembering and the neural mechanisms of recollection in humans? Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analyses to examine the effects of acute stress during retrieval. We report that stress reduced the probability of recollecting the details of past experience, and that this impairment was driven, in part, by a disruption of the relationship between hippocampal activation, cortical reinstatement, and memory performance. Moreover, even memories expressed with high confidence were less accurate under stress, and this stress-induced decline in accuracy was explained by reduced posterior hippocampal engagement despite similar levels of category-level cortical reinstatement. Finally, stress degraded the relationship between the engagement of frontoparietal control networks and retrieval decision uncertainty. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the widespread consequences of acute stress on the neural systems of remembering.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Quantitative Study on the Distribution of Mitochondria in the Neuropil of the Juvenile Rat Somatosensory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mitochondria play a key role in energy production and calcium buffering, among many other functions. They provide most of the energy required by neurons, and they are transported along axons and dendrites to the regions of higher energy demands. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. We have estimated the volume fraction occupied by mitochondria and their distribution between dendritic, axonal, and nonsynaptic processes. The volume fraction of mitochondria increased from layer I (4.59%) to reach its maximum in layer IV (7.74%) and decreased to its minimum in layer VI (4.03%). On average, 44% of mitochondrial volume was located in dendrites, 15% in axons and 41% in nonsynaptic elements. Given that dendrites, axons, and nonsynaptic elements occupied 38%, 23%, and 39% of the neuropil, respectively, it can be concluded that dendrites are proportionally richer in mitochondria with respect to axons, supporting the notion that most energy consumption takes place at the postsynaptic side. We also found a positive correlation between the volume fraction of mitochondria located in neuronal processes and the density of synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The Ras-MAPK pathway has an established role in neural development and synaptic signaling. Mutations in this pathway are associated with a collection of neurodevelopmental syndromes, Rasopathies; among these, Noonan syndrome (NS) is the most common (1:2000). Prior research has focused on identifying genetic mutations and cellular mechanisms of the disorder, however, effects of NS on the human brain remain unknown. Here, imaging and cognitive data were collected from 12 children with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PTPN11&lt;/span&gt;-related NS, ages 4.0–11.0 years (8.98 ± 2.33) and 12 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (8.79 ± 2.17). We observe reduced gray matter volume in bilateral corpus striatum (Cohen’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.0:−1.3), reduced surface area in temporal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.8:−2.2), increased cortical thickness in frontal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = 1.2–1.3), and reduced cortical thickness in limbic regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.6), including limbic structures integral to the circuitry of the hippocampus. Further, we find high levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and memory deficits in children with NS. Taken together, these results identify effects of NS on specific brain regions associated with ADHD and learning in children. While our research lays the groundwork for elucidating the neural and behavioral mechanisms of NS, it also adds an essential tier to understanding the Ras-MAPK pathway’s role in human brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Mental Imagery Follows Similar Cortical Reorganization as Perception: Intra-Modal and Cross-Modal Plasticity in Congenitally Blind</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical plasticity in congenitally blind individuals leads to cross-modal activation of the visual cortex and may lead to superior perceptual processing in the intact sensory domains. Although mental imagery is often defined as a quasi-perceptual experience, it is unknown whether it follows similar cortical reorganization as perception in blind individuals. In this study, we show that auditory versus tactile perception evokes similar intra-modal discriminative patterns in congenitally blind compared with sighted participants. These results indicate that cortical plasticity following visual deprivation does not influence broad intra-modal organization of auditory and tactile perception as measured by our task. Furthermore, not only the blind, but also the sighted participants showed cross-modal discriminative patterns for perception modality in the visual cortex. During mental imagery, both groups showed similar decoding accuracies for imagery modality in the intra-modal primary sensory cortices. However, no cross-modal discriminative information for imagery modality was found in early visual cortex of blind participants, in contrast to the sighted participants. We did find evidence of cross-modal activation of higher visual areas in blind participants, including the representation of specific-imagined auditory features in visual area V4.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Target Interneuron Preference in Thalamocortical Pathways Determines the Temporal Structure of Cortical Responses</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory processing relies on fast detection of changes in environment, as well as integration of contextual cues over time. The mechanisms by which local circuits of the cerebral cortex simultaneously perform these opposite processes remain obscure. Thalamic “specific” nuclei relay sensory information, whereas “nonspecific” nuclei convey information on the environmental and behavioral contexts. We expressed channelrhodopsin in the ventrobasal specific (sensory) or the rhomboid nonspecific (contextual) thalamic nuclei. By selectively activating each thalamic pathway, we found that nonspecific inputs powerfully activate adapting (slow-responding) interneurons but weakly connect fast-spiking interneurons, whereas specific inputs exhibit opposite interneuron preference. Specific inputs thereby induce rapid feedforward inhibition that limits response duration, whereas, in the same cortical area, nonspecific inputs elicit delayed feedforward inhibition that enables lasting recurrent excitation. Using a mean field model, we confirm that cortical response dynamics depends on the type of interneuron targeted by thalamocortical inputs and show that efficient recruitment of adapting interneurons prolongs the cortical response and allows the summation of sensory and contextual inputs. Hence, target choice between slow- and fast-responding inhibitory neurons endows cortical networks with a simple computational solution to perform both sensory detection and integration.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, we introduce &lt;i&gt;PyPhi&lt;/i&gt;, a Python software package that implements this framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete dynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study these structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the formalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research on complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an overview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi’s functionality in the course of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the algorithm’s design and implementation. PyPhi can be installed with Python’s package manager via the command ‘pip install pyphi’ on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher. PyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi. Comprehensive and continually-updated documentation is available at https://pyphi.readthedocs.io. The pyphi-users mailing list can be joined at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyphi-users. A web-based graphical interface to the software is available at http://integratedinformationtheory.org/calculate.html.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E2D_ME0roU4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With remarkable spatial and temporal specificities, peripheral membrane proteins bind to biological membranes. They do this without compromising solubility of the protein, and their binding sites are not easily distinguished. Prototypical peripheral membrane binding sites display a combination of patches of basic and hydrophobic amino acids that are also frequently present on other protein surfaces. The purpose of this contribution is to identify simple but essential components for membrane binding, through structural criteria that distinguish exposed hydrophobes at membrane binding sites from those that are frequently found on any protein surface. We formulate the concepts of &lt;i&gt;protruding hydrophobes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;co-insertability&lt;/i&gt; and have analysed more than 300 families of proteins that are classified as peripheral membrane binders. We find that this structural motif strongly discriminates the surfaces of membrane-binding and non-binding proteins. Our model constitutes a novel formulation of a structural pattern for membrane recognition and emphasizes the importance of subtle structural properties of hydrophobic membrane binding sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2OkhnFitdjc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications. OpenSim supports a large and growing community of biomechanics and rehabilitation researchers, facilitating exchange of models and simulations for reproducing and extending discoveries. Examples, tutorials, documentation, and an active user forum support this community. The OpenSim software is covered by the Apache License 2.0, which permits its use for any purpose including both nonprofit and commercial applications. The source code is freely and anonymously accessible on GitHub, where the community is welcomed to make contributions. Platform-specific installers of OpenSim include a GUI and are available on simtk.org.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Se-b8BemAY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Central Compensation in Auditory Brainstem after Damaging Noise Exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0250-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss and peripheral damage to the auditory system. A growing literature suggests that the auditory system can compensate for peripheral loss through increased central neural activity. The current study sought to investigate the link between noise exposure, increases in central gain, synaptic reorganization, and auditory function. All axons of the auditory nerve project to the cochlear nucleus, making it a requisite nucleus for sound detection. As the first synapse in the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus is well-positioned to respond plastically to loss of peripheral input. To investigate noise-induced compensation in the central auditory system, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), auditory perception, and collected tissue from mice exposed to broadband noise. Noise-exposed mice showed elevated ABR thresholds, reduced ABR wave 1 amplitudes, and spiral ganglion neuron loss. Despite peripheral damage, noise-exposed mice were hyper-reactive to loud sounds and showed nearly normal behavioral sound detection thresholds. Ratios of late ABR peaks (2-4) relative to the first ABR peak indicated that brainstem pathways were hyperactive in noise-exposed mice, while anatomical analysis indicated there was an imbalance between expression of excitatory and inhibitory proteins in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The results of the current study suggest that a reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus may drive hyperactivity in the central auditory system. This increase in central gain can compensate for peripheral loss to restore some aspects of auditory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Noise exposure can cause significant damage to the peripheral auditory system. Previous work has shown that the dorsal cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus, and auditory cortex become hyperactive following damage to the peripheral auditory system, which may compensate for decreased sensory input. Here we show that after noise exposure, hyperactivity develops in the auditory brainstem as a result of reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The compensatory plasticity observed at this early stage of the primary auditory pathway may contribute to the hyperactivity reported at later stages. Further, we show that this hyperactivity can compensate for reduced sensory input to partially restore some aspects of auditory function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sensory Adaptation to Chemical Cues by Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sensory adaptation is a source of experience-dependent feedback that impacts responses to environmental cues. In the mammalian main olfactory system (MOS), adaptation influences sensory coding at its earliest processing stages. Sensory adaptation in the accessory olfactory system (AOS) remains incompletely explored, leaving many aspects of the phenomenon unclear. We investigated sensory adaptation in vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and electrophysiology. Parallel studies revealed prominent short-term sensory adaptation in VSNs upon repeated stimulation with mouse urine and monomolecular bile acid ligands at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) less than 30 s. In such conditions, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and spike rates were often reduced by more than 50%, leading to dramatically reduced chemosensory sensitivity. Short-term adaptation was reversible over the course of minutes. Population Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging experiments revealed the presence of a slower form of VSN adaptation that accumulated over dozens of stimulus presentations delivered over tens of minutes. Most VSNs showed strong adaptation, but in a substantial VSN subpopulation adaptation was diminished or absent. Investigation of same- and opposite-sex urine responses in male and female VSNs revealed that adaptation to same-sex cues occurred at ISIs up to 180 s, conditions that did not induce adaptation to opposite-sex cues. This result suggests that VSN sensory adaptation can be modulated by sensory experience. These studies comprehensively establish the presence of VSN sensory adaptation and provide a foundation for future inquiries into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this phenomenon and its impact on mammalian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Peripheral sensory adaptation is an initial mechanism for experience-driven feedback in the nervous system. In the mammalian accessory olfactory system, which senses many social chemosignals, peripheral adaptation remains a subject of some debate. We investigated sensory adaptation to natural cues and monomolecular ligands in acute preparations of the vomeronasal organ, finding evidence for short- and long-term adaptation on repeated stimulation at defined intervals. We further tested whether adaptation differed to same-sex versus opposite-sex cues, finding that sensory adaptation was more prominent for same-sex cues in both males and females. These inquiries into accessory olfactory system adaptation provide a foundation for future inquiries into this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intranasal wnt3a Attenuates Neuronal Apoptosis through Frz1/PIWIL1a/FOXM1 Pathway in MCAO Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After ischemic stroke, apoptosis of neurons is a primary factor in determining outcome. Wnt3a is a naturally occurring protein that has been shown to have protective effects in the brain for traumatic brain injury. Although wnt3a has been investigated in the phenomena of neurogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammation, it has never been investigated as a therapy for stroke. We hypothesized that the potential neuroprotective agent wnt3a would reduce infarction and improve behavior following ischemic stroke by attenuating neuronal apoptosis and promoting cell survival through the Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 pathway in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. A total of 229 Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to male, female, and 9-month-old male MCAO or sham groups followed by reperfusion 2 h after MCAO. Animals assigned to MCAO were either given wnt3a or its control. To explore the downstream signaling of wnt3a, the following interventions were given: Frizzled-1 siRNA, PIWI1a siRNA, and PIWI1a-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, along with the appropriate controls. Post-MCAO assessments included neurobehavioral tests, infarct volume, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Endogenous levels of wnt3a and Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 were lowered after MCAO. The administration of intranasal wnt3a, 1 h after MCAO, increased PIWIL1a and FOXM1 expression through Frizzled-1, reducing brain infarction and neurological deficits at 24 and 72 h. Frizzled-1 and PIWI1a siRNAs reversed the protective effects of wnt3a after MCAO. Restoration of PIWI1a after knockdown of Frizzled-1 increased FOXM1 survival protein and reduced cleaved caspase-3 levels. In summary, wnt3a decreases neuronal apoptosis and improves neurological deficits through Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 pathway after MCAO in rats. Therefore, wnt3a is a novel intranasal approach to decrease apoptosis after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Only 5% of patients receive recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after stroke, and few qualify for mechanical thrombectomy. No neuroprotective agents have been successfully translated to promote neuronal survival in stroke. Thus, using a clinically relevant rat model of stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion, we explored a novel intranasal administration of wnt3a. wnt3a naturally occurs in the body and crosses the blood–brain barrier, supporting the clinically translatable approach of intranasal administration. Significant neuronal apoptosis occurs during stroke, and wnt3a shows promise due to its antiapoptotic effects. We investigated whether wnt3a mediates its poststroke effects via Frizzled-1 and the impact on its downstream signaling molecules, PIWI1a and FOXM1, in apoptosis. Elucidating the mechanism of wnt3a will identify additional pharmacological targets and further understanding of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Orbitofrontal Signaling of Future Reward is Associated with Hyperactivity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6779?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in motivated behavior are a hallmark of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior, but the link between OFC dysfunction and behavioral deficits in ADHD, particularly in adolescence, remains poorly understood. Here we used advanced high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human OFC in adolescents with ADHD and typically developing (TD) controls (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39, age 12–16, all male except for one female per group) to study reward-related OFC responses and how they relate to behavioral dysfunction in ADHD. During fMRI data acquisition, participants performed a simple decision-making task, allowing us to image expectation-related responses to small and large monetary outcomes. Across all participants, we observed significant signal increases to large versus small expected rewards in the OFC. These responses were significantly enhanced in ADHD relative to TD participants. Moreover, stronger reward-related activity was correlated with individual differences in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the ADHD group, whereas high cognitive ability was associated with normalized OFC responses. These results provide evidence for the importance of OFC dysfunctions in the neuropathology of ADHD, highlighting the role of OFC-dependent goal-directed control mechanisms in this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by alterations in motivated behavior which can be understood as diminished goal-directed control. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior, but its potential contribution to ADHD symptomatology remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI, we show that adolescent ADHD patients display enhanced OFC signaling of future rewards and that these increased reward-related responses are correlated with the severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity. These findings suggest that an inability to adequately evaluate future outcomes may translate into maladaptive behavior in ADHD patients. They also challenge the idea that dysfunctions in dopaminergic brain areas are the sole contributor to reward-related symptoms in ADHD and point to a central contribution of goal-directed control circuits in hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Representation of Landmark and Self-Motion Information along the CA1 Radial Axis: Self-Motion Generated Place Fields Shift toward Landmarks during Septal Inactivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6766?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial location in the environment can be defined in relation to specific landmarks or in relation to the global context, and is estimated from both the sensing of landmarks and the inner sense of cumulated locomotion referred to as path-integration. The respective contribution of landmark and path-integration to place-cell activity in the hippocampus is still unclear and complicated by the fact that the two mechanisms usually overlap. To bias spatial mechanisms toward landmark or path-integration, we use a treadmill equipped with a long belt on which male mice run sequentially through a zone enriched and a zone impoverished in visual-tactile cues. We show that inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which is known to disrupt the periodic activity of grid cells, impairs mice ability to anticipate the delivery of a reward in the cue-impoverished zone and transiently alter the spatial configuration of place fields in the cue-impoverished zone selectively: following MS inactivation, place fields in the cue-impoverished zone progressively shift backward and stabilize near the cues, resulting in the contraction of the spatial representation around cues; following MS recovery, the initial spatial representation is progressively restored. Furthermore, we found that place fields in the cue-rich and cue-impoverished zones are preferentially generated by cells from the deep and superficial sublayers of CA1, respectively. These findings demonstrate with mechanistic insights the contribution of MS to the spread of spatial representations in cue-impoverished zones, and indicate a segregation of landmark-based and path-integration-assisted spatial mechanisms into deep and superficial CA1, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cells encoding a cue-impoverished zone and the vicinity of landmarks responded differentially to septal inactivation and resided in distinct sublayers of CA1. These findings provide new insights on place field mechanisms: septal activity is critical for maintaining the spread of place fields in cue-impoverished areas, but not for the generation of place fields; Following MS inactivation, trial-by-trial network modifications by activity-dependent mechanisms are responsible for the gradual collapse of spatial representations. Furthermore, the findings suggest parallel coding streams for landmark and self-motion information. Superficial CA1 cells are better suited for encoding global position via the assist of path-integration, whereas deep CA1 cells can support spatial memory processes on an object-specific basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Neuromodulators such as dopamine can transform neural circuit function, but the mechanisms underlying such transformations are incompletely understood. A recent study introduced dLight1, a genetically encoded fluorescent dopamine indicator. dLight1 allows the optical measurement of dopamine sensed by isolated target circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution and has unique advantages for the study of neuromodulatory mechanisms.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An enormous potential for niche construction through bacterial cross-feeding in a homogeneous environment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena San Roman, Andreas Wagner&lt;/p&gt;

Microorganisms modify their environment by excreting by-products of metabolism, which can create new ecological niches that can help microbial populations diversify. A striking example comes from experimental evolution of genetically identical &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; populations that are grown in a homogeneous environment with the single carbon source glucose. In such experiments, stable communities of genetically diverse cross-feeding &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; cells readily emerge. Some cells that consume the primary carbon source glucose excrete a secondary carbon source, such as acetate, that sustains other community members. Few such cross-feeding polymorphisms are known experimentally, because they are difficult to screen for. We studied the potential of bacterial metabolism to create new ecological niches based on cross-feeding. To do so, we used genome scale models of the metabolism of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and metabolisms of similar complexity, to identify unique pairs of primary and secondary carbon sources in these metabolisms. We then combined dynamic flux balance analysis with analytical calculations to identify which pair of carbon sources can sustain a polymorphic cross-feeding community. We identified almost 10,000 such pairs of carbon sources, each of them corresponding to a unique ecological niche. Bacterial metabolism shows an immense potential for the construction of new ecological niches through cross feeding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4j1AnbKj0ts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Visual scene category representations emerge very rapidly, yet the computational transformations that enable such invariant categorizations remain elusive. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform visual categorization at near human-level accuracy using a feedforward architecture, providing neuroscientists with the opportunity to assess one successful series of representational transformations that enable categorization &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;. The goal of the current study is to assess the extent to which sequential scene category representations built by a CNN map onto those built in the human brain as assessed by high-density, time-resolved event-related potentials (ERPs). We found correspondence both over time and across the scalp: earlier (0–200 ms) ERP activity was best explained by early CNN layers at all electrodes. Although later activity at most electrode sites corresponded to earlier CNN layers, activity in right occipito-temporal electrodes was best explained by the later, fully-connected layers of the CNN around 225 ms post-stimulus, along with similar patterns in frontal electrodes. Taken together, these results suggest that the emergence of scene category representations develop through a dynamic interplay between early activity over occipital electrodes as well as later activity over temporal and frontal electrodes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZEQaAbJ1Wsg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Numerous gene fusions have been uncovered across multiple cancer types. Although the ability to target several of these fusions has led to the development of some successful anti-cancer drugs, most of them are not druggable. Understanding the molecular pathways of a fusion is important in determining its function in oncogenesis and in developing therapeutic strategies for patients harboring the fusion. However, the molecular pathways have been elucidated for only a few fusions, in part because of the labor-intensive nature of the required functional assays. Therefore, we developed a domain-based network approach to infer the pathways of a fusion. Molecular interactions of a fusion are first predicted by using its protein domain composition, and its associated pathways are then inferred from these molecular interactions. We demonstrated the capabilities of this approach by primarily applying it to the well-studied BCR-ABL1 fusion. The approach was also applied to two undruggable fusions in sarcoma, EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3. We successfully identified known genes and pathways associated with these fusions and satisfactorily validated these predictions using several benchmark sets. The predictions of EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3 also correlate with results of high-throughput drug screening. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach for inferring pathways of fusions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AlUtclLYt3M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the event of a new infectious disease outbreak, mathematical and simulation models are commonly used to inform policy by evaluating which control strategies will minimize the impact of the epidemic. In the early stages of such outbreaks, substantial parameter uncertainty may limit the ability of models to provide accurate predictions, and policymakers do not have the luxury of waiting for data to alleviate this state of uncertainty. For policymakers, however, it is the selection of the optimal control intervention in the face of uncertainty, rather than accuracy of model predictions, that is the measure of success that counts. We simulate the process of real-time decision-making by fitting an epidemic model to observed, spatially-explicit, infection data at weekly intervals throughout two historical outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, UK in 2001 and Miyazaki, Japan in 2010, and compare forward simulations of the impact of switching to an alternative control intervention at the time point in question. These are compared to policy recommendations generated in hindsight using data from the entire outbreak, thereby comparing the best we could have done at the time with the best we could have done in retrospect.
Our results show that the control policy that would have been chosen using all the data is also identified from an early stage in an outbreak using only the available data, despite high variability in projections of epidemic size. Critically, we find that it is an improved understanding of the locations of infected farms, rather than improved estimates of transmission parameters, that drives improved prediction of the relative performance of control interventions. However, the ability to estimate undetected infectious premises is a function of uncertainty in the transmission parameters. Here, we demonstrate the need for both real-time model fitting and generating projections to evaluate alternative control interventions throughout an outbreak. Our results highlight the use of using models at outbreak onset to inform policy and the importance of state-dependent interventions that adapt in response to additional information throughout an outbreak.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ssEqx6ziHQk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This has spurred current consideration of DLK as a candidate therapeutic target, and raises a vital question: in what context is DLK a friend or foe to neurons? Here, we review our current understanding of DLK’s function and mechanisms in regulating both regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal damage and stress in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The specific patterns and properties of these synaptic connections are fundamental to the computations cortical neurons perform. How such specificity arises in cortical circuits has remained elusive. Here, we first consider the cell-type, subcellular and synaptic specificity required for generating mature patterns of cortical connectivity and responses. Next, we focus on recent progress in understanding how the synaptic connections among excitatory cortical projection neurons are established during development using the primary visual cortex of the mouse as a model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300655-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A marginalized two-part Beta regression model for microbiome compositional data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006329</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Haitao Chai, Hongmei Jiang, Lu Lin, Lei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

In microbiome studies, an important goal is to detect differential abundance of microbes across clinical conditions and treatment options. However, the microbiome compositional data (quantified by relative abundance) are highly skewed, bounded in [0, 1), and often have many zeros. A two-part model is commonly used to separate zeros and positive values explicitly by two submodels: a logistic model for the probability of a specie being present in Part I, and a Beta regression model for the relative abundance conditional on the presence of the specie in Part II. However, the regression coefficients in Part II cannot provide a marginal (unconditional) interpretation of covariate effects on the microbial abundance, which is of great interest in many applications. In this paper, we propose a marginalized two-part Beta regression model which captures the zero-inflation and skewness of microbiome data and also allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal (unconditional) mean. We demonstrate its practical performance using simulation studies and apply the model to a real metagenomic dataset on mouse skin microbiota. We find that under the proposed marginalized model, without loss in power, the likelihood ratio test performs better in controlling the type I error than those under conventional methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PdhaI1pPOFI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mark EJ Sheffield, Daniel A Dombeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place cells in the hippocampus are thought to form a cognitive map of space and a memory of places. How this map forms when animals are exposed to novel environments has been the subject of a great deal of research. Numerous technical advances over the past decade greatly increased our understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying place field formation. In particular, it is now possible to connect cellular and circuit mechanisms of integration, firing, and plasticity discovered in brain slices, to processes taking place &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; as animals learn and encode novel environments. Here, we focus on recent results and describe the dendritic mechanisms most likely responsible for the formation of place fields. We also discuss key open questions that are likely to be answered in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Two papers in Neuron provide compelling new indications of a link between herpesviruses and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Readhead et al. report an increased abundance of human herpesviruses 6A and 7 (HHV-6A/7) in AD brain, whereas Eimer et al. show that binding of the AD signature protein, Aβ, to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HHV-6 surface glycoproteins causes fibrillar Aβ agglutination that can protect against viral challenge.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Challenges in Cell-Based Therapies for the Treatment of Hearing Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30169-3?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Hearing loss in mammals is an irreversible process caused by degeneration of the hair cells of the inner ear. Current therapies for hearing loss include hearing aids and cochlear implants that provide substantial benefits to most patients, but also have several shortcomings. There is great interest in the development of regenerative therapies to treat deafness in the future. Cell-based therapies, based either on adult, multipotent stem, or other types of pluripotent cells, offer promise for generating differentiated cell types to replace lost or damaged hair cells of the inner ear.</description>

	<description>How extracellular miRNA signals is unclear. Han et al. describe that miRNA-711, secreted from inoculated lymphoma cells on the back skin, binds TRPA1 ion channels extracellularly on pruriceptive neurons to drive acute and chronic itch via specific core sequence.</description>
