	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Mary A   Logan&lt;br /&gt; Glial cells are essential for proper formation and maintenance of the nervous system. During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Christian R   Burgess, Yoav   Livneh, Rohan N   Ramesh, Mark L   Andermann&lt;br /&gt; Physiological need states and associated motivational drives can bias visual processing of cues that help meet these needs. Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Amy F   Lloyd, Claire L   Davies, Veronique E   Miron&lt;br /&gt; Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), implicated in developmental processes, homeostasis, and responses to injury. Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity.

We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Over the past decades, quantitative methods linking theory and observation became increasingly important in many areas of life science. Subsequently, a large number of mathematical and computational models has been developed. The BioModels database alone lists more than 140,000 Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models. However, while the exchange within specific models classes has been supported by standardisation and database efforts, the generic application and especially the re-use of models is still limited by practical issues such as easy and straight forward model execution. MAGPIE, a Modeling and Analysis Generic Platform with Integrated Evaluation, closes this gap by providing a software platform for both, publishing and executing computational models without restrictions on the programming language, thereby combining a maximum on flexibility for programmers with easy handling for non-technical users. MAGPIE goes beyond classical SBML platforms by including &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; models, independent of the underlying programming language, ranging from simple script models to complex data integration and computations. We demonstrate the versatility of MAGPIE using four prototypic example cases. We also outline the potential of MAGPIE to improve transparency and reproducibility of computational models in life sciences. A demo server is available at magpie.imb.medizin.tu-dresden.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V972smzk-78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimal occlusion uniformly partitions red blood cells fluxes within a microvascular network</title>

In animals, gas exchange between blood and tissues occurs in narrow vessels, whose diameter is comparable to that of a red blood cell. Red blood cells must deform to squeeze through these narrow vessels, transiently blocking or occluding the vessels they pass through. Although the dynamics of vessel occlusion have been studied extensively, it remains an open question why microvessels need to be so narrow. We study occlusive dynamics within a model microvascular network: the embryonic zebrafish trunk. We show that pressure feedbacks created when red blood cells enter the finest vessels of the trunk act together to uniformly partition red blood cells through the microvasculature. Using mathematical models as well as direct observation, we show that these occlusive feedbacks are tuned throughout the trunk network to prevent the vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network. Thus occlusion is linked with another open question of microvascular function: how are red blood cells delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel? Our analysis shows that tuning of occlusive feedbacks increase the total dissipation within the network by a factor of 11, showing that uniformity of flows rather than minimization of transport costs may be prioritized by the microvascular network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5_-91bcH5rs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: High-frequency oscillations are not better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25124</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracerebral EEG (stereoelectroencephalography, SEEG) are considered as better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes. How this can be applied at the patient level remains poorly understood. We investigated how well the HFOs and the spikes can predict epileptogenic regions with a large spatial sampling at the patient level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of thirty patients. Ripples (R, 80-250Hz), fast ripples (FR, 250-500Hz) and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations – spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross rate (Spk⊗HFO) – were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon sign rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 2930 channels was analyzed (median of 100 channels per patient). The HFOs or any of its variants were not statistically better than spikes. Only one feature, the cross-rate was better than all the other markers. Moreover, fast ripples, even though very specific, were not delineating all epileptogenic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: At the patient level, the performance of the HFOs is weakened by the presence of strong physiological HFO generators. Fast ripples are not sensitive enough to be the unique biomarker of epileptogenicity. Nevertheless, combining HFOs and spikes using our proposed measure –the cross rate– is a better strategy than using only one marker. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of dementia at the population level, but how different neuropathologies contribute to cognitive decline at the individual level remains unknown. We quantified the contribution of nine neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. Methods: Participants (n=1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2+ cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. Results: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, more than 230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in &amp;lt;6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. Interpretation: There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B cell depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease, and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, have led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Lastly, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B cell based approaches to treatment.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Caspr2 antibodies in autoimmune encephalitis and neuromyotonia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To determine the pathogenic mechanisms of autoantibodies to the cell adhesion molecule Caspr2 in acquired neuromyotonia and autoimmune encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Caspr2 positive samples were confirmed using a cell-based assay, and their IgG subtypes were determined by ELISA and cell-based assay. A solid phase binding assay quantified the binding of Caspr2 to contactin-2 in the presence of Caspr2 autoantibodies. Living cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control sera and the distribution of Caspr2-positive immunofluorescent puncta and total surface Caspr2 were quantified. HEK cells transfected to express Caspr2 were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control samples, and cell-surface biotinylation and Western blot were used to assess total, internalized, and surface levels of Caspr2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We confirmed six samples with strong Caspr2 reactivity. IgG4 Caspr2 antibodies were present in all six cases. Caspr2 interacted with another cell adhesion molecule, contactin-2, with nanomolar affinity in the solid phase assay, and Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibited this interaction. Caspr2 autoantibodies did not affect the surface expression of Caspr2 in rat primary hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibit the interaction of Caspr2 with contactin-2 but do not cause internalization of Caspr2. Functional blocking of cell adhesion molecule interactions represents a potential mechanism with therapeutic implications for IgG4 autoantibodies to cell adhesion molecules in neurological diseases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Motor sequence awareness in impaired in dystonia despite normal performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/b&gt;: Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt; sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger tapping task. Because movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: Subjects with dystonia (n= 20) and healthy control adults (n= 30) performed finger tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings. Subjects were said to be “aware” of the motor pattern if they recognized their fingers moved in the same order during each stimulus-to-response remapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;: Subjects with dystonia had decreased motor pattern awareness, but those differences were not due to greater performance variability. Subjects with dystonia tapped sequences as series of discrete movements, rather than as a combined series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETATION: Dystonia is associated with impaired recognition of a repeating movement pattern. This difference may result from a strategy to separate sequential elements and attend to them individually. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inadequate Brain Glycogen or Sleep Increases Spreading Depression Susceptibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25122</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25122</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Glycogen in astrocyte endfeet contributes to maintenance of low extracellular glutamate and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations around synapses. Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We suppressed glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylation with 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and by SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: DAB caused neuronal pannexin-1 large-pore opening and activation of the downstream inflammatory pathway as shown by procaspase-1 cleavage and HMGB1 release from neurons. Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking-down neuronal lactate transporter, MCT2 with an anti-sense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly given phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, APG-4 disclosed that DAB treatment or SD caused significant rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during whisker-stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Synaptic metabolic stress caused by insufficient glycogen-derived energy substrate supply can activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels as well as lowering the CSD threshold. Therefore, conditions that limit energy supply to synapse (e.g. SD) may predispose to migraine attacks as suggested by genetic studies associating glucose or lactate transporter deficiency with migraine.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25111-sec-0101&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal seizures are assumed to arise from a hypersynchronous activity affecting a circumscribed brain region. Using microelectrodes in seizure-generating deep mesial regions of 9 patients, we investigated the firing of hundreds of single neurons before, during, and after ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) discharges. Neuronal spiking activity at seizure initiation was highly heterogeneous and not hypersynchronous. Furthermore, groups of neurons showed significant changes in activity minutes before the seizure with no concomitant changes in the corresponding macroscopic EEG recordings. Altogether, our findings suggest that only limited subsets of neurons in epileptic depth regions initiate the seizure-onset and that ictogenic mechanisms operate in submillimeter-scale microdomains.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptation to criticality through organizational invariance in embodied agents. (arXiv:1712.05284v1 [nlin.AO])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05284</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many biological and cognitive systems do not operate deep within one or other
regime of activity. Instead, they are poised at critical points located at
transitions of their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality suggests
that there may be general principles inducing this behaviour, yet there is no
well-founded theory for understanding how criticality is found at a wide range
of levels and contexts. In this paper we present a general adaptive mechanism
that maintains an internal organizational structure in order to drive a system
towards critical points while it interacts with different environments. We
implement the mechanism in artificial embodied agents controlled by a neural
network maintaining a correlation structure randomly sampled from an Ising
model at critical temperature. Agents are evaluated in two classical
reinforcement learning scenarios: the Mountain Car and the Acrobot double
pendulum. In both cases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality,
which coincides with a transition point between two regimes of the agent's
behaviour. These results suggest that adaptation to criticality could be used
as a general adaptive mechanism in some circumstances, providing an alternative
explanation for the pervasive presence of criticality in biological and
cognitive systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards Deep Modeling of Music Semantics using EEG Regularizers. (arXiv:1712.05197v1 [cs.IR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05197</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05197</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling of music audio semantics has been previously tackled through
learning of mappings from audio data to high-level tags or latent unsupervised
spaces. The resulting semantic spaces are theoretically limited, either because
the chosen high-level tags do not cover all of music semantics or because audio
data itself is not enough to determine music semantics. In this paper, we
propose a generic framework for semantics modeling that focuses on the
perception of the listener, through EEG data, in addition to audio data. We
implement this framework using a novel end-to-end 2-view Neural Network (NN)
architecture and a Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) loss function
that forces the semantic embedding spaces of both views to be maximally
correlated. We also detail how the EEG dataset was collected and use it to
train our proposed model. We evaluate the learned semantic space in a transfer
learning context, by using it as an audio feature extractor in an independent
dataset and proxy task: music audio-lyrics cross-modal retrieval. We show that
our embedding model outperforms Spotify features and performs comparably to a
state-of-the-art embedding model that was trained on 700 times more data. We
further propose improvements to the model that are likely to improve its
performance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Why early tactile speech aids may have failed: no perceptual integration of tactile and auditory signals. (arXiv:1712.04987v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04987</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04987</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tactile speech aids, though extensively studied in the 1980s and 90s, never
became a commercial success. A hypothesis to explain this failure might be that
it is difficult to obtain true perceptual integration of a tactile signal with
information from auditory speech: exploitation of tactile cues from a tactile
aid might require cognitive effort and so prevent speech understanding at the
high rates typical of everyday speech. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to
create true perceptual integration of tactile with auditory information in what
might be considered the simplest situation encountered by a hearing-impaired
listener. We created an auditory continuum between the syllables BA and VA, and
trained participants to associate BA to one tactile stimulus VA to another
tactile stimulus. After training, we tested if auditory discrimination along
the continuum between the two syllables could be biased by incongruent tactile
stimulation. We found that such a bias occurred only when the tactile stimulus
was above its previously measured tactile discrimination threshold. Such a
pattern is compatible with the idea that the effect is due to a cognitive or
decisional strategy, rather than to truly perceptual integration. We therefore
ran a further study, where we created a tactile version of the McGurk effect.
We extensively trained two Subjects over six days to associate four recorded
auditory syllables with four corresponding apparent motion tactile patterns. In
a subsequent test, we presented stimulation that was either congruent or
incongruent with the learnt association, and asked Subjects to report the
syllable they perceived. We found no analog to the McGurk effect. These
findings strengthen our hypothesis according to which tactile aids failed
because integration of tactile cues with auditory speech occurred at a
cognitive or decisional level, rather than truly at a perceptual level

	<description>Single-wavelength fluorescent reporters allow visualization of specific neurotransmitters with high spatial and temporal resolution. We report variants of the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR that are functionally brighter; can detect sub-micromolar to millimolar concentrations of glutamate; and have blue, green or yellow emission profiles. These variants allow in vivo imaging where original-iGluSnFR was too dim, reveal glutamate transients at individual spine heads, and permit kilohertz imaging with inexpensive, powerful fiber lasers.</description>

	<description>Objective: High-Frequency alternating current (HFAC) nerve block has great potential for neuromodulation-based therapies. However nerve function recovery dynamics after a block is highly understudied. This study aims to characterise the recovery dynamics of neural function after an HFAC block. Approach: Experiments were carried out in-vivo to determine blocking efficacy as a function of blocking signal amplitude and frequency, and recovery times as well as recovery completeness was measured within a 0.7s time scale from the end of block. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at 100 Hz during recovery to reduce error to within {+/-}10 ms for measurements of recovery dynamics. The electromyogram (EMG) signals were measured from gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior during trials as an indicator for nerve function. Main Results: The HFAC block was most reliable around 20 kHz, with block thresholds approximately 5 or 6 mA depending on the animal and muscle. Recovery times ranged from 20 to 430 milliseconds and final values spanned relative outputs from approximately 1 to 0.2. Higher blocking signal frequencies and amplitudes increased recovery time and decreased recovery completeness. Significance: These results confirm that recovery dynamics from block depend on blocking signal frequency and amplitude, which is of particular importance for neuromodulation therapies and for comparing results across studies using different blocking signal parameters.</description>

	<description>Memory performance exhibits a high level of variability from moment to moment. Much of this variability may reflect inadequately controlled experimental variables, such as word memorability, past practice and subject fatigue. Alternatively, stochastic variability in performance may largely reflect the efficiency of endogenous neural processes that govern memory function. To help adjudicate between these competing views, we conducted a multisession study in which subjects completed 552 trials of a delayed free-recall task. Applying a statistical model to predict variability in each subject's recall performance uncovered modest effects of word memorability, proactive interference, and other variables. In contrast to the limited explanatory power of these experimental variables, performance on the prior list strongly predicted current list recall. These findings suggest that endogenous factors underlying successful encoding and retrieval drive variability in performance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distractor inhibition contributes to retroactive attentional orienting within working memory: Evidence by lateralized event-related parameters of the EEG</title>

	<description>Shifts of attention within mental representations based on retroactive cues (retro-cues) facilitate performance in working memory tasks. It was suggested that this retro-cue benefit is related to the concentration of working memory resources on a subset of representations, thereby improving storage and retrieval at the cost of non-cued items. However, the attentional mechanisms underlying this updating of working memory representations remain unknown. Here, we present EEG data for distinguishing between target enhancement and distractor suppression processes in the context of retroactive attentional orienting. Therefore, we used a working memory paradigm with retro-cues indicating a shift of attention to either a lateralized or non-lateralized item. Posterior and anterior asymmetries in the event-related potential suggested a contribution of both target enhancement and distractor suppression to retroactive attentional selection. Following this stage of selection, there was an increase of posterior alpha power contralateral compared to ipsilateral to the irrelevant item when a non-lateralized mental representation was cued. No comparable asymmetry was revealed when a lateralized item had to be selected. This suggests that the inhibition of the non-cued information is an important feature of attentional orienting within working memory. The current results thus enable a first impression on the interplay of attentional sub-processes in the context of retroactive cuing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Associated valence impacts early visual processing of linguistic stimuli: Evidence from ERPs in a cross-modal learning paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234864v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Emotion effects in event-related potentials (ERPs) during reading have been observed at very short latencies of around 100 to 200 ms after word onset. The nature of these effects remains a matter of debate: First, it is possible that they reflect semantic access, which might thus occur much faster than proposed by most reading models. Second, it is possible that associative learning of a word's shape might contribute to the emergence of emotion effects during visual processing. The present study addressed this question by employing an associative learning paradigm on pseudowords. In a learning session, pseudowords were associated with positive, neutral or negative valence by means of monetary gain, loss or zero-outcome. Crucially, half of the pseudowords were learned in the visual modality, while the other half was presented acoustically, allowing for experimental separation of associated valence and physical percept. In a test session 1 to 2 days later, acquired pseudowords were presented in an old/new decision task while we recorded event-related potentials. Behavioural data showed an advantage for gain-associated pseudowords both during learning and in a delayed old/new task. In the visual test session, early emotion effects in ERPs were limited to visually acquired pseudowords, but absent for acoustically acquired pseudowords. These results imply that associative learning of a word's visual features might play an important role in the emergence of emotion effects at the stage of perceptual processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Partial ablation of the orexin field induces a subnarcoleptic phenotype in a conditional mouse model of orexin neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>Narcolepsy type 1 (Na-1) and 2 (Na-2) are characterized by an inability to sustain wakefulness and are likely caused by degeneration of orexin neurons. Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood, but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To validate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Sex differences were observed in the rate of orexin cell loss. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, six weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin cell loss. Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wake-promotion develops in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multi-attribute Decision-making is Best Characterized by an Attribute-Wise Reinforcement Learning Model</title>

	<description>Choice alternatives often consist of multiple attributes that vary in how successfully they predict reward. Some standard theoretical models assert that decision makers evaluate choices either by weighting those attribute optimally in light of previous experience (so-called rational models), or adopting heuristics that use attributes suboptimally but in a manner that yields reasonable performance at minimal cost (e.g., the take-the-best heuristic). However, these models ignore both the possibility that decision makers might learn to associate reward with whole stimuli (a particular combination of attributes) rather than individual attributes and the common finding that decisions can be overly influenced by recent experiences and exhibit cue competition effects. Participants completed a two-alternative choice task where each stimulus consisted of three binary attributes that were predictive of reward, albeit with different degrees of reliability. Their choices revealed that, rather than using only the &quot;best&quot; attribute, they made use of all attributes but in manner that reflected the classic cue competition effect known as overshadowing. The time needed to make decisions increased as the number of relevant attributes increased, suggesting that reward was associated with attributes rather than whole stimuli. Fitting a family of computational models formed by crossing attribute use (optimal vs. only the best), representation (attribute vs. whole stimuli), and recency (biased or not), revealed that models that performed better when they made use of all information, represented attributes, and incorporated recency effects and cue competition. We also discuss the need to incorporate selective attention and hypothesis-testing like processes to account for results with multiple-attribute stimuli.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The tortoise and the hare: interactions between reinforcement learning and working memory.</title>

	<description>Learning to make rewarding choices in response to stimuli depends on a slow but steady process, reinforcement learning, and a fast and flexible, but capacity limited process, working memory. Using both systems in parallel, with their contributions weighted based on performance, should allow us to leverage the best of each system: rapid early learning, supplemented by long term robust acquisition. However, this assumes that using one process does not interfere with the other. We use computational modeling to investigate the interactions between the two processes in a behavioral experiment, and show that working memory interferes with reinforcement learning. Previous research showed that neural representations of reward prediction errors, a key marker of reinforcement learning, were blunted when working memory was used for learning. We thus predicted that arbitrating in favor of working memory to learn faster in simple problems would weaken the reinforcement learning process. We tested this by measuring performance in a delayed testing phase where the use of working memory was impossible, and thus subject choices depended on reinforcement learning. Counter-intuitively, but confirming our predictions, we observed that associations learned most easily were retained worse than associations learned slower: using working memory to learn quickly came at the cost of long-term retention. Computational modeling confirmed that this could only be accounted for by working memory interference in reinforcement learning computations. These results further our understanding of how multiple systems contribute in parallel to human learning, and may have important applications for education and computational psychiatry.</description>

	<description>Insufficient responses to hypocaloric diets have been attributed to hormonal adaptations that override self-control of food intake. We tested this hypothesis by measuring brain fMRI reactivity to food cues and circulating energy-balance hormones in 24 overweight/obese participants before, and 1 and 3 months after starting a calorie restriction diet. Increased activity in prefrontal regions at month 1 correlated with weight loss at months 1 and 3. Weight loss was also correlated with increased plasma ghrelin and decreased leptin at month 1, and these changes were associated with greater food cue reactivity in reward-related brain regions. However, the reduction in leptin did not counteract weight loss; indeed, it was correlated with further weight loss at month 3. Activation in a network of prefrontal regions associated with self-control could contribute to individual differences in weight loss and maintenance, whereas we failed to find that the hormonal adaptations play a major role.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pharmacological manipulation of olfactory bulb granule cell excitability modulates beta oscillations: Testing a model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234625v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) generates gamma (40 - 100 Hz) and beta (15 - 30 Hz) oscillations of the local field potential (LFP). Gamma oscillations arise at the peak of inhalation supported by dendrodendritic interactions between glutamatergic mitral cells (MCs) and GABAergic granule cells (GCs). Beta oscillations occur in response to odorants in learning or odor sensitization paradigms, but their generation mechanism and function are still poorly understood. When centrifugal inputs to the OB are blocked, beta oscillations disappear, but gamma oscillations persist. Centrifugal input targets primarily GABAergic interneurons in the GC layer (GCL) and regulates GC excitability, which suggests a causal link between beta oscillations and GC excitability. Previous modeling work from our laboratory predicted that convergence of excitatory/inhibitory inputs onto MCs and centrifugal inputs onto GCs can increase GC excitability sufficiently to drive beta oscillations primarily through voltage dependent calcium channel (VDCC) mediated GABA release, independently of NMDA channels. We test this model by examining the influence of NMDA and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on GC excitability and beta oscillations. Intrabulbar scopolamine (muscarinic antagonist) infusion decreased or completely suppressed odor-evoked beta in response to a strong stimulus, but increased beta power in response to a weak stimulus, as predicted by our model. Piriform cortex (PC) beta power was unchanged. Oxotremorine (muscarinic agonist) tended to suppress all oscillations, probably from over-inhibition. APV, an NMDA receptor antagonist, suppressed gamma oscillations selectively (in OB and PC), lending support to the model's prediction that beta oscillations can be supported by VDCC mediated currents.</description>

	<description>Humans have a remarkably high capacity and long duration memory for complex scenes. Previous research documents the neural substrates that allow for efficient categorization of scenes from other complex stimuli like objects and faces, but the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying scene memory are less well understood. In the present study, we used high density EEG during a visual continuous recognition task in which new, old, and scrambled scenes consisting of color outdoor photographs were presented at an average rate 0.26 Hz. Old scenes were single repeated presentations occurring within either a short-term (&amp;lt; 20 seconds) or longer-term intervals of between 30 sec and 3 minutes or 4 and 10 minutes. Overall recognition was far above chance, with better performance at short- than longer-term intervals. A group ANOVA found parietal and frontal ERPs discriminated the three scene types as early as 59 ms after stimulus onset. Parietal ERPs were greater for old compared to new scenes by 189 ms, while fronto-temporal ERPs were greater for new compared to old scenes by 194 ms. For old scenes presented within longer-term intervals, parieto-temporal and centro-frontal ERPs were greater by 228 and 355 ms respectively compared to old scenes presented within a short-term interval. Supervised machine learning exhibited above-chance decoding of scene type by 275 ms. Single-subject BOLD-fMRI showed greater activity for old scenes across frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex. These converging findings show that a widespread network including parietal, frontal, and temporal regions supports short- and long-term scene memory.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Brain and psychological determinants of placebo pill response in chronic pain patients</title>

	<description>Placebo response is universally observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), yet these effects are commonly dismissed as consequences of uncontrollable confounds. In this prospective neuroimaging-based RCT performed in chronic back pain patients, we demonstrate that the intensity, but not quality, of pain is diminished with placebo pill ingestion. The response to placebo pills depended on brain: subcortical limbic volume asymmetry, sensorimotor cortical thickness, and functional coupling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with the periaqueductal grey (PAG), the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and the precentral gyrus (PreCG); and psychological factors. All features were present before exposure to the pill; most remained stable across treatment and washout periods, although specific functional coupling between DLPFC and PAG dissipated with repeated exposure. These brain properties and specific psychological factors, such as interoceptive awareness and openness, were also predictive of the magnitude of response (continuous variable). We used machine learning in a fully cross-validated procedure and demonstrated that psychological factors were sufficient for classifying and predicting response magnitude; and response magnitude could also be predicted from a functional network (nodes mainly located in the limbic community, the DLPFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the temporo-parietal junction); the combined model explained 36% of the variance. Together, our results demonstrate that placebo pill analgesia observed in clinical trials depends on a combination of brain properties and specific psychological factors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The role of explicit strategies during reinforcement-based motor learning</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234534v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Despite increasing interest in the role of reward in motor learning, the underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined. In particular, the relevance of explicit strategies to reward-based motor learning is unclear. To address this, we examined subjects (n=30) ability to learn to compensate for a gradually introduced 25degree visuomotor rotation with only reward-based feedback (binary success/failure). Only two-thirds of subjects (n=20) were successful at the maximum angle. The remaining subjects initially follow the rotation but after a variable number of trials begin to reach at an insufficiently large angle and subsequently return to near baseline performance (n=10). Furthermore, those that were successful accomplished this largely via the use of strategies, evidenced by a large reduction in reach angle when asked to remove any strategy they employed. However, both groups display a small degree of remaining retention even after the removal of strategies. All subjects made greater and more variable changes in reach angle following incorrect (unrewarded) trials. However, subjects who failed to learn showed decreased sensitivity to errors, even in the initial period in which they followed the rotation, a pattern previously found in Parkinsonian patients. In a second experiment, the addition of a secondary mental rotation task completely abolished learning (n=10), whilst a control group replicated the results of the first experiment (n=10). These results emphasize a pivotal role of strategy-use during reinforcement-based motor learning and the susceptibility of this form of learning to disruption has important implications for its potential therapeutic benefits.</description>

Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the nonnegativity constraints we will derive fast multiplicative update rules for several problems of interest in signal processing, including non-negative deconvolution, point-process smoothing, ML estimation for Poisson Observations, nonnegative least squares and nonnega- tive matrix factorization (NMF). Our algorithm can also account for temporal and spatial structure and regularization. We will analyze the performance of our algorithm on simultaneously recorded neuronal calcium imaging and electrophysiology data.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234443v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The most fundamental choice an animal has to make when it detects a predator, or other threats, is whether to freeze, reducing its chances of being noticed, or to flee to safety. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exposed to looming stimuli in a confined arena either froze or fled. The probability of freezing versus fleeing was modulated by the fly's walking speed at the time of threat, demonstrating that freeze/flee decisions were context dependent. We describe a pair of descending neurons crucially implicated in freezing. Genetic silencing of P9 descending neurons disrupted freezing yet did not prevent fleeing. Optogenetic activation of both P9 neurons induced running and freezing in a state-dependent manner. Our findings establish walking speed as a key factor in defensive response choices and reveal a pair of descending neurons as a critical component in the circuitry mediating selection and execution of freezing or fleeing behaviors.</description>

	<description>Humans tend to use elapsed time to increase the perceived probability that an impending event - e.g., the Go sign at a traffic light - will occur soon. This prompts faster reactions for longer waiting times (hazard rate effect). Which neural processes reflect instead the perceived probability of uncertain future events? We recorded behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants detected a target tone, rarely appearing at one of three successive positions of a repeating five-tone sequence with equal probability. Pre-stimulus oscillatory power in the low beta-band range (Beta 1: 15-19 Hz) predicted the hazard rate of response times to the uncertain target, suggesting it encodes abstract estimates of a potential event onset. Informing participants about the target's equiprobable distribution endogenously suppressed the hazard rate of response times. Beta 1 power still predicted behavior, validating its role in contextually estimating temporal probabilities for uncertain future events.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ubiquitin ligase LNX1 is a major regulator of glycine recapture by the presynaptic transporter GlyT2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/233213v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/233213v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The neuronal glycine transporter GlyT2 is an essential regulator of glycinergic neurotransmission that recaptures glycine in presynaptic terminals to facilitate quantal transmitter packaging in synaptic vesicles. Alterations in GlyT2 expression or activity result in lower cytosolic glycine levels, emptying glycinergic synaptic vesicles and impairing neurotransmission. Lack of glycinergic neurotransmission caused by GlyT2 loss-of-function mutations results in Hyperekplexia, a rare neurological disease characterized by generalized stiffness and motor alterations that may result in sudden infant death. Although the importance of GlyT2 in pathology is known, how this transporter is regulated at the molecular level is poorly understood, limiting current therapeutic strategies. Guided by an unbiased screening, we discovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ligand of Numb protein X1 (LNX1) modulates the ubiquitination status of GlyT2. LNX1 ubiquitinates a cytoplasmic C-terminal lysine cluster in GlyT2 (K751, K773, K787 and K791) through its N-terminus RING-finger domain, and this process regulates the expression levels and transport activity of GlyT2 in neurons. These experiments reveal for the first time the identity of an E3 ubiquitin-ligase acting on GlyT2 and identify a novel regulatory mechanism by which neurons regulate GlyT2 expression and activity.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/233007v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Working memory, the ability to keep recently encountered information available for immediate processing, has been proposed to rely on two mechanisms that appear difficult to reconcile: self-sustained neural firing, or the opposite -- activity-silent synaptic traces. Here we show that both phenomena can co-exist within a unified system in which neurons hold information in both activity and synapses. Rapid plasticity in flexibly-coding neurons allows features to be bound together into objects, with an important emergent property being the focus of attention. One memory item is held by persistent activity in an attended or &quot;focused&quot; state, and is thus remembered better than other items. Other, previously attended items can remain in memory but in the background, encoded in activity-silent synaptic traces. This dual functional architecture provides a unified common mechanism accounting for a diverse range of perplexing attention and memory effects that have been hitherto difficult to explain in a single theoretical framework.</description>

	<description>Background: Jumping to conclusions during probabilistic reasoning is a cognitive bias reliably observed in psychosis, and linked to delusion formation. Although the reasons why people jump to conclusions are unknown, one suggestion is that they view sampling information as costly. However, previous computational modelling (Moutoussis et al. 2011) has provided evidence against it, suggesting that patients with chronic schizophrenia jump to conclusion because of noisy decision making. We therefore developed a novel version of the classical beads-task where the cost of information gathering is systematically manipulated. Methods: For 31 individuals with early psychosis, and 31 healthy volunteers we examined the numbers of 'draws to decision' when information sampling had no, a fixed, or an escalating cost. Computational modelling was identical to previous work, and involved estimating a cost of information sampling and a cognitive noise parameters. Results: Overall patients sampled less information than controls. However, group differences in numbers of draws became less prominent at higher cost trials, as less information was sampled by both groups. The attenuation of group difference was not due to floor effects, as in the most costly condition participants sampled more information than an ideal Bayesian agent. Computational modelling showed that patients attributed higher costs to information sampling than controls, but groups did not differ in the noise parameter. Conclusion: Using a psychological manipulation and computational modelling, we provide evidence that early psychosis patients jump to conclusions because of attributing higher costs to sampling information, and not because of being noisy decision makers.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Costs of task allocation with local feedback: Effects of colony size and extra workers in social insects and other multi-agent systems</title>

Adaptive collective systems are common in biology and beyond. Typically, such systems require a task allocation algorithm: a mechanism or rule-set by which individuals select particular roles. Here we study the performance of such task allocation mechanisms measured in terms of the time for individuals to allocate to tasks. We ask: (1) Is task allocation fundamentally difficult, and thus costly? (2) Does the performance of task allocation mechanisms depend on the number of individuals? And (3) what other parameters may affect their efficiency? We use techniques from distributed computing theory to develop a model of a social insect colony, where workers have to be allocated to a set of tasks; however, our model is generalizable to other systems. We show, first, that the ability of workers to quickly assess demand for work in tasks they are not currently engaged in crucially affects whether task allocation is quickly achieved or not. This indicates that in social insect tasks such as thermoregulation, where temperature may provide a global and near instantaneous stimulus to measure the need for cooling, for example, it should be easy to match the number of workers to the need for work. In other tasks, such as nest repair, it may be impossible for workers not directly at the work site to know that this task needs more workers. We argue that this affects whether task allocation mechanisms are under strong selection. Second, we show that colony size does not affect task allocation performance under our assumptions. This implies that when effects of colony size are found, they are not inherent in the process of task allocation itself, but due to processes not modeled here, such as higher variation in task demand for smaller colonies, benefits of specialized workers, or constant overhead costs. Third, we show that the ratio of the number of available workers to the workload crucially affects performance. Thus, workers in excess of those needed to complete all tasks improve task allocation performance. This provides a potential explanation for the phenomenon that social insect colonies commonly contain inactive workers: these may be a ‘surplus’ set of workers that improves colony function by speeding up optimal allocation of workers to tasks. Overall our study shows how limitations at the individual level can affect group level outcomes, and suggests new hypotheses that can be explored empirically.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xk21hJ2vyb0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a Master Equation approach to calculating polymerization dynamics and force generation by branched actin networks at membranes. The method treats the time evolution of the F-actin distribution in three dimensions, with branching included as a directional spreading term. It is validated by comparison with stochastic simulations of force generation by actin polymerization at obstacles coated with actin “nucleation promoting factors” (NPFs). The method is then used to treat the dynamics of actin polymerization and force generation during endocytosis in yeast, using a model in which NPFs form a ring around the endocytic site, centered by a spot of molecules attaching the actin network strongly to the membrane. We find that a spontaneous actin filament nucleation mechanism is required for adequate forces to drive the process, that partial inhibition of branching and polymerization lead to different characteristic responses, and that a limited range of polymerization-rate values provide effective invagination and obtain correct predictions for the effects of mutations in the active regions of the NPFs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZc3KkNB-1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Specific excitatory connectivity for feature integration in mouse primary visual cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005888</guid>

Local excitatory connections in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are stronger and more prevalent between neurons that share similar functional response features. However, the details of how functional rules for local connectivity shape neuronal responses in V1 remain unknown. We hypothesised that complex responses to visual stimuli may arise as a consequence of rules for selective excitatory connectivity within the local network in the superficial layers of mouse V1. In mouse V1 many neurons respond to overlapping grating stimuli (plaid stimuli) with highly selective and facilitatory responses, which are not simply predicted by responses to single gratings presented alone. This complexity is surprising, since excitatory neurons in V1 are considered to be mainly tuned to single preferred orientations. Here we examined the consequences for visual processing of two alternative connectivity schemes: in the first case, &lt;i&gt;local connections are aligned with visual properties inherited from feedforward input&lt;/i&gt; (a ‘like-to-like’ scheme specifically connecting neurons that share similar preferred orientations); in the second case, &lt;i&gt;local connections group neurons into excitatory subnetworks that combine and amplify multiple feedforward visual properties (a ‘feature binding’ scheme)&lt;/i&gt;. By comparing predictions from large scale computational models with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of visual representations in mouse V1, we found that responses to plaid stimuli were best explained by assuming ‘feature binding’ connectivity. Unlike under the ‘like-to-like’ scheme, selective amplification within feature-binding excitatory subnetworks replicated experimentally observed facilitatory responses to plaid stimuli; explained selective plaid responses not predicted by grating selectivity; and was consistent with broad anatomical selectivity observed in mouse V1. Our results show that visual feature binding can occur through local recurrent mechanisms without requiring feedforward convergence, and that such a mechanism is consistent with visual responses and cortical anatomy in mouse V1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-UU1qp-u0DM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Novel linear motif filtering protocol reveals the role of the LC8 dynein light chain in the Hippo pathway</title>

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) formed between short linear motifs and globular domains play important roles in many regulatory and signaling processes but are highly underrepresented in current protein-protein interaction databases. These types of interactions are usually characterized by a specific binding motif that captures the key amino acids shared among the interaction partners. However, the computational proteome-level identification of interaction partners based on the known motif is hindered by the huge number of randomly occurring matches from which biologically relevant motif hits need to be extracted. In this work, we established a novel bioinformatic filtering protocol to efficiently explore interaction network of a hub protein. We introduced a novel measure that enabled the optimization of the elements and parameter settings of the pipeline which was built from multiple sequence-based prediction methods. In addition, data collected from PPI databases and evolutionary analyses were also incorporated to further increase the biological relevance of the identified motif hits. The approach was applied to the dynein light chain LC8, a ubiquitous eukaryotic hub protein that has been suggested to be involved in motor-related functions as well as promoting the dimerization of various proteins by recognizing linear motifs in its partners. From the list of putative binding motifs collected by our protocol, several novel peptides were experimentally verified to bind LC8. Altogether 71 potential new motif instances were identified. The expanded list of LC8 binding partners revealed the evolutionary plasticity of binding partners despite the highly conserved binding interface. In addition, it also highlighted a novel, conserved function of LC8 in the upstream regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Beyond the LC8 system, our work also provides general guidelines that can be applied to explore the interaction network of other linear motif binding proteins or protein domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NZ17tOKCm8c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Feature reliability determines specificity and transfer of perceptual learning in orientation search</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005882</guid>

Training can modify the visual system to produce a substantial improvement on perceptual tasks and therefore has applications for treating visual deficits. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is often specific to the trained feature, which gives insight into processes underlying brain plasticity, but limits VPL’s effectiveness in rehabilitation. Under what circumstances VPL transfers to untrained stimuli is poorly understood. Here we report a qualitatively new phenomenon: intrinsic variation in the representation of features determines the transfer of VPL. Orientations around cardinal are represented more reliably than orientations around oblique in V1, which has been linked to behavioral consequences such as visual search asymmetries. We studied VPL for visual search of near-cardinal or oblique targets among distractors of the other orientation while controlling for other display and task attributes, including task precision, task difficulty, and stimulus exposure. Learning was the same in all training conditions; however, transfer depended on the orientation of the target, with full transfer of learning from near-cardinal to oblique targets but not the reverse. To evaluate the idea that representational reliability was the key difference between the orientations in determining VPL transfer, we created a model that combined orientation-dependent reliability, improvement of reliability with learning, and an optimal search strategy. Modeling suggested that not only search asymmetries but also the asymmetric transfer of VPL depended on preexisting differences between the reliability of near-cardinal and oblique representations. Transfer asymmetries in model behavior also depended on having different learning rates for targets and distractors, such that greater learning for low-reliability distractors facilitated transfer. These findings suggest that training on sensory features with intrinsically low reliability may maximize the generalizability of learning in complex visual environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ky4fAG2t6r4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Place cells in the hippocampus are active when an animal visits a certain
locations (referred to as place fields) within an environment and remain silent
otherwise. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) respond at multiple
locations, with firing fields that exhibit a hexagonally symmetric periodic
pattern. The joint activity of grid and place cell populations, as a function
of location, forms a neural code for space. An ensemble of codes, for a given
set of parameters, is generated by selecting grid and place cell population and
tuning curve parameters. For each ensemble, codewords are generated by
stimulating a network with a discrete set of locations. In this manuscript, we
develop an understanding of the relationships between coding theoretic
properties of these combined populations and code construction parameters.
These observations are revisited by measuring the performances of biologically
realizable algorithms (e.g. neural bit-flipping) implemented by a network of
place and grid cell populations, as well as interneurons, which perform
de-noising operations. Simulations demonstrate that de-noising mechanisms
analyzed here can significantly improve fidelity of this neural representation
of space. Further, patterns observed in connectivity of each population of
simulated cells suggest the existence of heretofore unobserved neurobiological
phenomena.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We revisit the behavior of a prototypical model of balanced activity in
networks of spiking neurons. A detailed study of an appropriate thermodynamic
limit for fixed density of connections shows that, when inhibition prevails,
the asymptotic regime is characterized by a self-sustained irregular,
macroscopic (collective) dynamics rather than being asynchronous. This holds
true even for very small coupling strengths. A relationship with the collective
chaos observed in standard (unbalanced) heterogeneous networks is also put
forward and the role played by clustered states discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present data for the lognormal distributions of spike
rates, synaptic weights and intrinsic excitability (gain) for neurons in
various brain areas, such as auditory or visual cortex, hippocampus,
cerebellum, striatum, midbrain nuclei. We find a remarkable consistency of
heavy-tailed, specifically lognormal, distributions for rates, weights and
gains in all brain areas examined. The difference between strongly recurrent
and feed-forward connectivity (cortex vs. striatum and cerebellum),
neurotransmitter (GABA (striatum) or glutamate (cortex)) or the level of
activation (low in cortex, high in Purkinje cells and midbrain nuclei) turns
out to be irrelevant for this feature. Logarithmic scale distribution of
weights and gains appears to be a general, functional property in all cases
analyzed. We then created a generic neural model to investigate adaptive
learning rules that create and maintain lognormal distributions. We
conclusively demonstrate that not only weights, but also intrinsic gains, need
to have strong Hebbian learning in order to produce and maintain the
experimentally attested distributions. This provides a solution to the
long-standing question about the type of plasticity exhibited by intrinsic
excitability.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Translational Control Mechanisms in Persistent Pain</title>

	<description>Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world’s population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain.</description>

	<description>Helfrich et al. demonstrate that the precise coupling between sleeping brainwaves, called slow waves and spindles, supports memory retention. However, this brainwave coupling during sleep is impaired in older adults due to loss of tissue in the medial frontal lobe, resulting in next-day forgetting.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: KCC2-dependent Steady-state Intracellular Chloride Concentration and pH in Cortical Layer 2/3 Neurons of Anesthetized and Awake Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234476v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234476v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neuronal intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) influences a wide range of processes such as neuronal inhibition, membrane potential dynamics, intracellular pH (pHi) or cell volume. Up to date, neuronal [Cl-]i has predominantly been studied in model systems of reduced complexity. Here, we implemented the genetically encoded ratiometric Cl- indicator Superclomeleon (SCLM) to estimate the steady-state [Cl-]i in cortical neurons from anesthetized and awake mice using 2-photon microscopy. Additionally, we implemented superecliptic pHluorin as a ratiometric sensor to estimate the intracellular steady-state pH (pHi) of mouse cortical neurons in vivo. We estimated an average resting [Cl-]i of 6 {+/-} 2 mM with no evidence of subcellular gradients in the proximal somato-dendritic domain and an average somatic pHi of 7.1 {+/-} 0.1. Neither [Cl-]i nor pHi were affected by isoflurane anesthesia. We deleted the cation-Cl- co-transporter KCC2 in single identified neurons of adult mice and found an increase of [Cl-]i to approximately 26 {+/-} 8 mM, demonstrating that under in vivo conditions KCC2 produces low [Cl-]i in adult mouse neurons. In summary, neurons of the brain of awake adult mice exhibit a low and evenly distributed [Cl-]i in the proximal somato-dendritic compartment that is independent of anesthesia and requires KCC2 expression for its maintenance.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 17{beta}-Estradiol Acutely Potentiates Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission in the Hippocampus through Distinct Mechanisms in Males and Females</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12314?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12314?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol (E2) acutely potentiates glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of both male and female rats. Here, we investigated whether E2-induced synaptic potentiation occurs via presynaptic and/or postsynaptic mechanisms and which estrogen receptors (ERs) mediate E2's effects in each sex. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that E2 increases both mEPSC frequency and amplitude within minutes, but often in different cells. This indicated that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms are involved, but that they occur largely at different synapses. Two-photon (2p) glutamate uncaging at individual dendritic spines showed that E2 increases the amplitude of uncaging-evoked EPSCs (2pEPSCs) and calcium transients (2pCaTs) at a subset of spines on a dendrite, demonstrating synapse specificity of E2's postsynaptic effects. All of these results were essentially the same in males and females. However, additional experiments using ER-selective agonists indicated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying E2-induced potentiation. In males, an ERβ agonist mimicked the postsynaptic effects of E2 to increase mEPSC, 2pEPSC, and 2pCaT amplitude, whereas in females, these effects were mimicked by an agonist of G protein-coupled ER-1. The presynaptic effect of E2, increased mEPSC frequency, was mimicked by an ERα agonist in males, whereas in females, an ERβ agonist increased mEPSC frequency. Thus, E2 acutely potentiates glutamatergic synapses similarly in both sexes, but distinct ER subtypes mediate the presynaptic and postsynaptic aspects of potentiation in each sex. This indicates a latent sex difference in which different molecular mechanisms converge to the same functional endpoint in males versus females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some sex differences in the brain may be latent differences, in which the same functional endpoint is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males versus females. Here we report a latent sex difference in molecular regulation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. The steroid 17β-estradiol is known to acutely potentiate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in both sexes. We find that this occurs through a combination of increased presynaptic glutamate release probability and increased postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate in both sexes, but that distinct estrogen receptor subtypes underlie each aspect of potentiation in each sex. These results indicate that therapeutics targeting a specific estrogen receptor subtype or its downstream signaling would likely affect synaptic transmission differently in the hippocampus of each sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Graded Elevation of c-Jun in Schwann Cells In Vivo: Gene Dosage Determines Effects on Development, Remyelination, Tumorigenesis, and Hypomyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12297?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell c-Jun is implicated in adaptive and maladaptive functions in peripheral nerves. In injured nerves, this transcription factor promotes the repair Schwann cell phenotype and regeneration and promotes Schwann-cell-mediated neurotrophic support in models of peripheral neuropathies. However, c-Jun is associated with tumor formation in some systems, potentially suppresses myelin genes, and has been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies. To clarify these issues and to determine how c-Jun levels determine its function, we have generated c-Jun OE/+ and c-Jun OE/OE mice with graded expression of c-Jun in Schwann cells and examined these lines during development, in adulthood, and after injury using RNA sequencing analysis, quantitative electron microscopic morphometry, Western blotting, and functional tests. Schwann cells are remarkably tolerant of elevated c-Jun because the nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, in which c-Jun is elevated ~6-fold, are normal with the exception of modestly reduced myelin thickness. The stronger elevation of c-Jun in c-Jun OE/OE mice is, however, sufficient to induce significant hypomyelination pathology, implicating c-Jun as a potential player in demyelinating neuropathies. The tumor suppressor P19&lt;sup&gt;ARF&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly activated in the nerves of these mice and, even in aged c-Jun OE/OE mice, there is no evidence of tumors. This is consistent with the fact that tumors do not form in injured nerves, although they contain proliferating Schwann cells with strikingly elevated c-Jun. Furthermore, in crushed nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, where c-Jun levels are overexpressed sufficiently to accelerate axonal regeneration, myelination and function are restored after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In injured and diseased nerves, the transcription factor c-Jun in Schwann cells is elevated and variously implicated in controlling beneficial or adverse functions, including trophic Schwann cell support for neurons, promotion of regeneration, tumorigenesis, and suppression of myelination. To analyze the functions of c-Jun, we have used transgenic mice with graded elevation of Schwann cell c-Jun. We show that high c-Jun elevation is a potential pathogenic mechanism because it inhibits myelination. Conversely, we did not find a link between c-Jun elevation and tumorigenesis. Modest c-Jun elevation, which is beneficial for regeneration, is well tolerated during Schwann cell development and in the adult and is compatible with restoration of myelination and nerve function after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Hierarchical Rule Sets: The Human Control System Represents Rules Irrespective of the Hierarchical Level to Which They Belong</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12281?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans use rules to organize their actions to achieve specific goals. Although simple rules that link a sensory stimulus to one response may suffice in some situations, often, the application of multiple, hierarchically organized rules is required. Recent theories suggest that progressively higher level rules are encoded along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. Although some evidence supports the existence of such a functional gradient, other studies argue for a lesser degree of specialization within PFC. We used fMRI to investigate whether rules at different hierarchical levels are represented at distinct locations in the brain or encoded by a single system. Thirty-seven male and female participants represented and applied hierarchical rule sets containing one lower-level stimulus–response rule and one higher-level selection rule. We used multivariate pattern analysis to investigate directly the representation of rules at each hierarchical level in absence of information about rules from other levels or other task-related information, thus providing a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We could decode low- and high-level rules from local patterns of brain activity within a wide frontoparietal network. However, no significant difference existed between regions encoding representations of rules from both levels except for precentral gyrus, which represented only low-level rule information. Our findings show that the brain represents conditional rules regardless of their level in the explored hierarchy, so the human control system did not organize task representation according to this dimension. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying critical principles that shape this control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Several recent studies investigating the organization of the human control system propose that rules at different control levels are organized along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. In this study, we used multivariate pattern analysis to explore independently the representation of formally identical conditional rules belonging to different levels of a cognitive hierarchy and provide for the first time a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We found no major spatial differences between regions encoding rules from different hierarchical levels. This suggests that the human brain does not use levels in the investigated hierarchy as a topographical organization principle to represent rules controlling our behavior. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying which principles are critical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of {gamma}-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;-Secretase is an intramembrane cleaving protease that is responsible for the generation of amyloid-β peptides, which are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recently, -secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to specifically decrease production of the aggregation-prone and toxic longer Aβ species, and concomitantly increase the levels of shorter Aβ. We previously found that phenylimidazole-type GSMs bind to presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of the -secretase, and allosterically modulate -secretase activity. However, the precise conformational alterations in PS1 remained unclear. Here we mapped the amino acid residues in PS1 that is crucial for the binding and pharmacological actions of E2012, a phenylimidazole-type GSM, using photoaffinity labeling and the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We also demonstrated that a piston-like vertical motion of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 occurs during modulation of Aβ production. Taking these results together, we propose a model for the molecular mechanism of phenylimidazole-type GSMs, in which the trimming activity of -secretase is modulated by the position of the TMD1 of PS1 in the lipid bilayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduction of the toxic longer amyloid-β peptide is one of the therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease. A subset of small compounds called -secretase modulators specifically decreases the longer amyloid-β production, although its mechanistic action remains unclear. Here we found that the modulator compound E2012 targets to the hydrophilic loop 1 of presenilin 1, which is a catalytic subunit of the -secretase. Moreover, E2012 triggers the piston movement of the transmembrane domain 1 of presenilin 1, which impacts on the -secretase activity. These results illuminate how -secretase modulators allosterically affect the proteolytic activity, and highlight the importance of the structural dynamics of presenilin 1 in the complexed process of the intramembrane cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multimodal Imaging in Rat Model Recapitulates Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abnormalities</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Imaging biomarkers are frequently proposed as endpoints for clinical trials targeting brain amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific impact of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation on biomarker abnormalities remains elusive in AD. Using the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat as a model of selective Aβ pathology, we characterized the longitudinal progression of abnormalities in biomarkers commonly used in AD research. Middle-aged (9–11 months) transgenic animals (both male and female) displayed mild spatial memory impairments and disrupted cingulate network connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI, even in the absence of hypometabolism (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG) or detectable fibrillary amyloidosis (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]NAV4694). At more advanced ages (16–19 months), cognitive deficits progressed in conjunction with resting connectivity abnormalities; furthermore, hypometabolism, Aβ plaque accumulation, reduction of CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, and hippocampal atrophy (structural MRI) were detectable at this stage. The present results emphasize the early impact of Aβ on brain connectivity and support a framework in which persistent Aβ aggregation itself is sufficient to impose memory circuits dysfunction, which propagates to adjacent brain networks at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study proposes a &quot;back translation&quot; of the Alzheimer pathological cascade concept from human to animals. We used the same set of Alzheimer imaging biomarkers typically used in large human cohorts and assessed their progression over time in a transgenic rat model, which allows for a finer spatial resolution not attainable with mice. Using this translational platform, we demonstrated that amyloid-β pathology recapitulates an Alzheimer-like profile of biomarker abnormalities even in the absence of other hallmarks of the disease such as neurofibrillary tangles and widespread neuronal losses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular and Molecular Analysis of Dendritic Morphogenesis in a Retinal Cell Type That Senses Color Contrast and Ventral Motion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As neuronal dendrites develop, they acquire cell-type-specific features including characteristic size, shape, arborization, location and synaptic patterns. These features, in turn, are major determinants of type-specific neuronal function. Because neuronal diversity complicates the task of relating developmental programs to adult structure and function, we analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type in mouse called J-RGC. We documented the emergence of five dendritic features that underlie J-RGC physiology: (1) dendritic field size, which approximate receptive field size; (2) dendritic complexity, which affects how J-RGCs sample space; (3) asymmetry, which contributes to direction-selectivity; (4) restricted lamination within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which renders J-RGCs responsive to light decrements; and (5) distribution of synaptic inputs, which generate a color-opponent receptive field. We found dendritic growth in J-RGCs is accompanied by a refinement in dendritic self-crossing. Asymmetry arises by a combination of selective pruning and elaboration, whereas laminar restriction results from biased outgrowth toward the outermost IPL. Interestingly, asymmetry develops in a protracted dorsoventral wave, whereas lamination does so in a rapid centrifugal wave. As arbors mature, they acquire excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with the latter forming first and being concentrated in proximal dendrites. Thus, distinct mechanisms operate in different spatiotemporal dimensions of J-RGC dendritic patterning to generate the substrate for specific patterns of synaptogenesis. Finally, we asked whether the defining molecular signature of J-RGCs, the adhesion molecule JAM-B, regulates morphogenesis, and showed that it promotes dendro-dendritic interactions. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that shape a dendritic arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual perception begins in the retina, where distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are tuned to specific visual features such as direction of motion. The features to which each RGC type responds are determined largely by the number and type of synaptic inputs it receives, and these, in turn, are greatly influenced by the size, shape, arborization pattern, and location of its dendrites. We analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a functionally characterized RGC type, the J-RGC, demonstrating distinct mechanisms that operate in different dimensions to generate the dendritic scaffold and synaptic patterns for feature detection. Our work elucidates cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape dendritic arbors and synaptic distribution, enabling J-RGC connectivity and thus, function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep in Humans Stabilizes Pattern Separation Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Replay of hippocampal neural representations during sleep is thought to promote systems consolidation of declarative memory. How this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the hippocampal representation itself, is unclear. Here we tested hippocampal stimulus processing (i.e., pattern separation) before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans (female and male participants). Pattern separation deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) with this sleep–wake difference being most pronounced for stimuli with low similarity to targets (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Stimuli with the highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation performance after sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038). Pattern separation performance was positively correlated with sleep spindle density, slow oscillation density, and theta power phase-locked to slow oscillations. Sleep, presumably by neural memory replay, shapes hippocampal representations and enhances computations of pattern separation to subsequent presentation of similar stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories is causally related to reactivation during sleep of previously encoded representations. Here, we show that reactivation-based consolidation processes during sleep shape the hippocampal representation itself. We studied the effect of sleep and wakefulness on pattern separation (i.e., orthogonalization of similar representations) and completion performance (i.e., recall of a memory in light of noisy input) that are essential cognitive elements of encoding and retrieval of information by the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that pattern separation was stabilized after sleep but diminished after wakefulness. We further showed that pattern separation was related to EEG oscillatory parameters of non-REM sleep serving as markers of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Configurations in the Human Brain Reflect Choice Bias during Rapid Face Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network interactions are likely to be instrumental in processes underlying rapid perception and cognition. Specifically, high-level and perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal characterization of brain–network interactions combined with improved anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12 males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely encoded in frontal &quot;late&quot; regions on perceptual processes occurring in &quot;early&quot; perceptual regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our choices are affected by our biases. In visual perception and cognition such biases can be commonplace and quite curious—e.g., we see a human face when staring up at a cloud formation or down at a piece of toast at the breakfast table. Here we use multimodal neuroimaging and dynamical systems analysis to measure whole-brain spatiotemporal dynamics while subjects make decisions regarding the type of object they see in rapidly flashed images. We find that the degree of interaction in these networks accounts for a substantial fraction of our bias to see faces. In general, our findings illustrate how the properties of spatiotemporal networks yield insight into the mechanisms of how we form decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuropeptide S Activates Paraventricular Oxytocin Neurons to Induce Anxiolysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide S (NPS) and oxytocin (OXT), represent potential options for the treatment of anxiety disorders due to their potent anxiolytic profile. In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the behavioral action of NPS, and present a chain of evidence that the effects of NPS within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are mediated via actions on local OXT neurons in male Wistar rats. First, retrograde studies identified NPS fibers originating in the brainstem locus coeruleus, and projecting to the PVN. FACS identified prominent NPS receptor expression in PVN-OXT neurons. Using genetically encoded calcium indicators, we further demonstrated that NPS reliably induces a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in a subpopulation of OXT neurons, an effect mediated by NPS receptor. In addition, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NPS evoked a significant somatodendritic release of OXT within the PVN as assessed by microdialysis in combination with a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay. Finally, we could show that the anxiolytic effect of NPS seen after i.c.v. or intra-PVN infusion requires responsive OXT neurons of the PVN and locally released OXT. Thus, pharmacological blockade of OXT receptors as well as chemogenetic silencing of OXT neurons within the PVN prevented the effect of synthetic NPS. In conclusion, our results indicate a significant role of the OXT system in mediating the effects of NPS on anxiety, and fill an important gap in our understanding of brain neuropeptide interactions in the context of regulation of emotional behavior within the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the rising scientific interest in neuropeptide research in the context of emotional and stress-related behaviors, our findings demonstrate a novel intrahypothalamic mechanism involving paraventricular oxytocin neurons that express the neuropeptide S receptor. These neurons respond with transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase and somatodendritic oxytocin release following neuropeptide S stimulation. Thereby, oxytocin neurons seem essential for neuropeptide S-induced anxiolysis, as this effect was blocked by pharmacological and chemogenetic inhibition of the oxytocin system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Ric-8b in Olfactory Sensory Neurons Leads to Olfactory Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system can discriminate a vast number of odorants. This ability derives from the existence of a large family of odorant receptors expressed in the cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons. Odorant receptors signal through the olfactory-specific G-protein subunit, Gαolf. Ric-8b, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with Gαolf and can amplify odorant receptor signal transduction &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. To explore the function of Ric-8b &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated a tissue specific knock-out mouse by crossing OMP-Cre transgenic mice to Ric-8b floxed mice. We found that olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice of mixed sex do not express the Gαolf protein in the olfactory epithelium. We also found that in these mice, the mature olfactory sensory neuron layer is reduced, and that olfactory sensory neurons show increased rate of cell death compared with wild-type mice. Finally, behavioral tests showed that the olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice show an impaired sense of smell, even though their motivation and mobility behaviors remain normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ric-8b is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) expressed in the olfactory epithelium and in the striatum. Ric-8b interacts with the olfactory Gαolf subunit, and can amplify odorant signaling through odorant receptors &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, the functional significance of this GEF in the olfactory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains unknown. We report that deletion of Ric-8b in olfactory sensory neurons prevents stable expression of Gαolf. In addition, we demonstrate that olfactory neurons lacking Ric-8b (and consequently Gαolf) are more susceptible to cell death. Ric-8b conditional knock-out mice display impaired olfactory guided behavior. Our results reveal that Ric-8b is essential for olfactory function, and suggest that it may also be essential for Gαolf-dependent functions in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extensive Tonotopic Mapping across Auditory Cortex Is Recapitulated by Spectrally Directed Attention and Systematically Related to Cortical Myeloarchitecture</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12187?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation—acoustic frequency—might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish in male and female listeners that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically mapped nonprimary auditory cortex. The attentionally driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in areas outside traditional auditory cortex. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored; the same regions do not show this enhancement when attending to the least-preferred frequency band. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perception is an active process, especially sensitive to attentional state. Listeners direct auditory attention to track a violin's melody within an ensemble performance, or to follow a voice in a crowded cafe. Although diverse pathologies reduce quality of life by impacting such spectrally directed auditory attention, its neurobiological bases are unclear. We demonstrate that human primary and nonprimary auditory cortical activation is modulated by spectrally directed attention in a manner that recapitulates its tonotopic sensory organization. Further, the graded activation profiles evoked by single-frequency bands are correlated with attentionally driven activation when these bands are presented in complex soundscapes. Finally, we observe a strong concordance in the degree of cortical myelination and the strength of tonotopic activation across several auditory cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Working Memory and Decision-Making in a Frontoparietal Circuit Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12167?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) and decision-making (DM) are fundamental cognitive functions involving a distributed interacting network of brain areas, with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the core. However, the shared and distinct roles of these areas and the nature of their coordination in cognitive function remain poorly understood. Biophysically based computational models of cortical circuits have provided insights into the mechanisms supporting these functions, yet they have primarily focused on the local microcircuit level, raising questions about the principles for distributed cognitive computation in multiregional networks. To examine these issues, we developed a distributed circuit model of two reciprocally interacting modules representing PPC and PFC circuits. The circuit architecture includes hierarchical differences in local recurrent structure and implements reciprocal long-range projections. This parsimonious model captures a range of behavioral and neuronal features of frontoparietal circuits across multiple WM and DM paradigms. In the context of WM, both areas exhibit persistent activity, but, in response to intervening distractors, PPC transiently encodes distractors while PFC filters distractors and supports WM robustness. With regard to DM, the PPC module generates graded representations of accumulated evidence supporting target selection, while the PFC module generates more categorical responses related to action or choice. These findings suggest computational principles for distributed, hierarchical processing in cortex during cognitive function and provide a framework for extension to multiregional models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory and decision-making are fundamental &quot;building blocks&quot; of cognition, and deficits in these functions are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. These cognitive functions engage distributed networks with prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at the core. It is not clear, however, what the contributions of PPC and PFC are in light of the computations that subserve working memory and decision-making. We constructed a biophysical model of a reciprocally connected frontoparietal circuit that revealed shared and distinct functions for the PFC and PPC across working memory and decision-making tasks. Our parsimonious model connects circuit-level properties to cognitive functions and suggests novel design principles beyond those of local circuits for cognitive processing in multiregional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological Constraints on Cerebellar Granule Cell Combinatorial Diversity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial expansion by the cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL) is fundamental to theories of cerebellar contributions to motor control and learning. Granule cells (GrCs) sample approximately four mossy fiber inputs and are thought to form a combinatorial code useful for pattern separation and learning. We constructed a spatially realistic model of the cerebellar GCL and examined how GCL architecture contributes to GrC combinatorial diversity. We found that GrC combinatorial diversity saturates quickly as mossy fiber input diversity increases, and that this saturation is in part a consequence of short dendrites, which limit access to diverse inputs and favor dense sampling of local inputs. This local sampling also produced GrCs that were combinatorially redundant, even when input diversity was extremely high. In addition, we found that mossy fiber clustering, which is a common anatomical pattern, also led to increased redundancy of GrC input combinations. We related this redundancy to hypothesized roles of temporal expansion of GrC information encoding in service of learned timing, and we show that GCL architecture produces GrC populations that support both temporal and combinatorial expansion. Finally, we used novel anatomical measurements from mice of either sex to inform modeling of sparse and filopodia-bearing mossy fibers, finding that these circuit features uniquely contribute to enhancing GrC diversification and redundancy. Our results complement information theoretic studies of granule layer structure and provide insight into the contributions of granule layer anatomical features to afferent mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar granule cells are among the simplest neurons, with tiny somata and, on average, just four dendrites. These characteristics, along with their dense organization, inspired influential theoretical work on the granule cell layer as a combinatorial expander, where each granule cell represents a unique combination of inputs. Despite the centrality of these theories to cerebellar physiology, the degree of expansion supported by anatomically realistic patterns of inputs is unknown. Using modeling and anatomy, we show that realistic input patterns constrain combinatorial diversity by producing redundant combinations, which nevertheless could support temporal diversification of like combinations, suitable for learned timing. Our study suggests a neural substrate for producing high levels of both combinatorial and temporal diversity in the granule cell layer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12141?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moiré interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase TRAF6 Exacerbates Ischemic Stroke by Ubiquitinating and Activating Rac1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12123?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity contribute to neuronal death during ischemic stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying these complicated pathophysiological processes remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was markedly increased after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice. TRAF6 ablation in male mice decreased the infarct volume and neurological deficit scores and decreased proinflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, and neuronal death after cerebral I/R, whereas transgenic overexpression of TRAF6 in male mice exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TRAF6 induced Rac1 activation and consequently promoted I/R injury by directly binding and ubiquitinating Rac1. Either functionally mutating the TRAF6 ubiquitination site on Rac1 or inactivating Rac1 with a specific inhibitor reversed the deleterious effects of TRAF6 overexpression during I/R injury. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TRAF6 is a key promoter of ischemic signaling cascades and neuronal death after cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, the TRAF6/Rac1 pathway might be a promising target to attenuate cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is one of the most severe and devastating neurological diseases globally. The complicated pathophysiological processes restrict the translation of potential therapeutic targets into medicine. Further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury may open a new window for pharmacological interventions to promote recovery from stroke. Our study revealed that ischemia-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) upregulation binds and ubiquitinates Rac1 directly, which promotes neuron death through neuroinflammation and neuro-oxidative signals. Therefore, precisely targeting the TRAF6-Rac1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Detailed Dendritic Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance through Heterosynaptic Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12106?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is a key feature of cortical dynamics. Such a balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. In this study, we developed computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to show that the excitatory/inhibitory balance in dendritic branches is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model reproduces key features of experimental heterosynaptic STDP well, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how the maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates the selectivity of excitatory neurons for binocular matching in the critical period plasticity. The model also provides an alternative explanation for the potential mechanism underlying the somatic detailed balance that is commonly associated with inhibitory STDP. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and the resultant dendritic computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental studies reveal that relative differences in spike timings experienced among neighboring glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a dendritic branch significantly influences changes in the efficiency of these synapses. This heterosynaptic form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is potentially important for shaping the synaptic organization and computation of neurons, but its functional role remains elusive. Through computational modeling at the parameter regime where previous experimental results are well reproduced, we show that heterosynaptic plasticity serves to finely balance excitatory and inhibitory inputs on the dendrite. Our results suggest a principle of GABA-driven neural circuit formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FGF-FGFR Mediates the Activity-Dependent Dendritogenesis of Layer IV Neurons during Barrel Formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12094?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) are known for their potent effects on cell proliferation/differentiation and cortical patterning in the developing brain. However, little is known regarding the roles of FGFs/FGFRs in cortical circuit formation. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/3 and &lt;i&gt;Fgf7&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;22&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs are expressed in the developing primary somatosensory (S1) barrel cortex. Barrel cortex layer IV spiny stellate cells (bSCs) are the primary recipients of ascending sensory information via thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Detail quantification revealed distinctive phases for bSC dendritogenesis: orienting dendrites toward TCAs, adding &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; dendritic segments, and elongating dendritic length, while maintaining dendritic patterns. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; in bSCs had minimal impact on dendritic polarity but transiently increased the number of dendritic segments. However, 6 d later, FGFR1/2/3 loss of function reduced dendritic branch numbers. These data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs have a role in stabilizing dendritic patterning. Depolarization of cultured mouse cortical neurons upregulated the levels of several &lt;i&gt;Fgf&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Fgfr&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs within 2 h. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, within 6 h of systemic kainic acid administration at postnatal day 6, mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Fgf9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgf10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgfr2c&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3b&lt;/i&gt; in S1 cortices were enhanced, and this was accompanied by exuberant dendritogenesis of bSCs by 24 h. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; abolished kainic acid-induced bSC dendritic overgrowth. Finally, FGF9/10 gain of function also resulted in extensive dendritogenesis. Together, our data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs can be regulated by glutamate transmission to modulate/stabilize bSC dendritic complexity. Both male and female mice were used for our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamatergic transmission plays critical roles in cortical circuit formation. Its dysregulation has been proposed as a core factor in the etiology of many neurological diseases. We found that excessive glutamate transmission upregulated mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Fgfrs&lt;/i&gt; and their ligands &lt;i&gt;Fgfs&lt;/i&gt;. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; not only impaired bSC dendritogenesis but also abolished glutamate transmission-induced dendritic overgrowth. Overexpressing FGF9 or FGF10 in cortical glutamatergic neurons results in excessive dendritic outgrowth within 24 h, resembling the changes induced by excessive glutamate transmission. Our findings provide strong evidence for the physiological role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in establishing and maintaining cortical circuits. Perturbing the expression levels of FGFs/FGFRs by excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission could lead to abnormal neuronal circuits, which may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A geometric model of multi-scale orientation preference maps via Gabor functions. (arXiv:1712.04329v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04329</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04329</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a new model for the generation of orientation
preference maps in the primary visual cortex (V1), considering both orientation
and scale features. First we undertake to model the functional architecture of
V1 by interpreting it as a principal fiber bundle over the 2-dimensional
retinal plane by introducing intrinsic variables orientation and scale. The
intrinsic variables constitute a fiber on each point of the retinal plane and
the set of receptive profiles of simple cells is located on the fiber. Each
receptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as a rotated Gabor
function derived from an uncertainty principle. The visual stimulus is lifted
in a 4-dimensional space, characterized by coordinate variables, position,
orientation and scale, through a linear filtering of the stimulus with Gabor
functions. Orientation preference maps are then obtained by mapping the
orientation value found from the lifting of a noise stimulus onto the
2-dimensional retinal plane. This corresponds to a Bargmann transform in the
reducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)=\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$ group. A
comparison will be provided with a previous model based on the Bargman
transform in the irreducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)$ group,
outlining that the new model is more physiologically motivated. Then we present
simulation results related to the construction of the orientation preference
map by using Gabor filters with different scales and compare those results to
the relevant neurophysiological findings in the literature.

including image generation. Repeated inference between data space and latent
space in these models can denoise cluttered images and improve the quality of
inferred results. However, previous studies only qualitatively evaluated image
outputs in data space, and the mechanism behind the inference has not been
investigated. The purpose of the current study is to numerically analyze
changes in activity patterns of neurons in the latent space of a deep
generative model called a &quot;variational auto-encoder&quot; (VAE). What kinds of
inference dynamics the VAE demonstrates when noise is added to the input data
are identified. The VAE embeds a dataset with clear cluster structures in the
latent space and the center of each cluster of multiple correlated data points
(memories) is referred as the concept. Our study demonstrated that transient
dynamics of inference first approaches a concept, and then moves close to a
memory. Moreover, the VAE revealed that the inference dynamics approaches a
more abstract concept to the extent that the uncertainty of input data
increases due to noise. It was demonstrated that by increasing the number of
the latent variables, the trend of the inference dynamics to approach a concept
can be enhanced, and the generalization ability of the VAE can be improved.

	<description>Using induced human dopamine (DA) neurons, a study by Burbulla and colleagues demonstrated a toxic cascade of cellular dysfunctions which may underlie Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. Their findings reveal what could be the causal relationship between multiple pathogenic pathways in human neurons obtained from idiopathic and familial cases, and suggest novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadav Ben-Shushan, Misha Tsodyks&lt;/p&gt;

Recurrent and feedback networks are capable of holding dynamic memories. Nonetheless, training a network for that task is challenging. In order to do so, one should face non-linear propagation of errors in the system. Small deviations from the desired dynamics due to error or inherent noise might have a dramatic effect in the future. A method to cope with these difficulties is thus needed. In this work we focus on recurrent networks with linear activation functions and binary output unit. We characterize its ability to reproduce a temporal sequence of actions over its output unit. We suggest casting the temporal learning problem to a perceptron problem. In the discrete case a finite margin appears, providing the network, to some extent, robustness to noise, for which it performs perfectly (i.e. producing a desired sequence for an arbitrary number of cycles flawlessly). In the continuous case the margin approaches zero when the output unit changes its state, hence the network is only able to reproduce the sequence with slight jitters. Numerical simulation suggest that in the discrete time case, the longest sequence that can be learned scales, at best, as square root of the network size. A dramatic effect occurs when learning several short sequences in parallel, that is, their total length substantially exceeds the length of the longest single sequence the network can learn. This model easily generalizes to an arbitrary number of output units, which boost its performance. This effect is demonstrated by considering two practical examples for sequence learning. This work suggests a way to overcome stability problems for training recurrent networks and further quantifies the performance of a network under the specific learning scheme.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ezNQD0Wd52s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The receptor-like tyrosine kinase (Ryk), a Wnt receptor, is important for cell fate determination during corticogenesis. During neuronal differentiation, the Ryk intracellular domain (ICD) is cleaved. Cleavage of Ryk and nuclear translocation of Ryk-ICD are required for neuronal differentiation. However, the mechanism of translocation and how it regulates neuronal differentiation...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/GHQ19WQIXM4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Numerous viruses, including HIV-1, exploit the microtubule network to traffic toward the nucleus during infection. Although numerous studies have observed a role for the minus-end microtubule motor dynein in HIV-1 infection, the mechanism by which the viral core containing the viral genome associates with dynein and induces its perinuclear trafficking...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/azVqBS7lgjE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>AP-4 is a member of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complex family involved in protein sorting in the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells. Interest in AP-4 has recently risen with the discovery that mutations in any of its four subunits cause a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) with intellectual...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/b74luyjbCZE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical and genetic findings in children with central nervous system arteriovenous fistulas</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the spectrum of genetic anomalies in a cohort of children presenting at least one cerebral or spinal pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and to describe their clinical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1988 to 2016, all consecutive patients with at least one cerebral or spinal pial AVF were screened for genetic disease. All patients aged &amp;lt;18 years were included. Symptoms associated with AVF were recorded: heart failure, neurological deficit/seizure, and hemorrhage. The outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale and school performance in children with cerebral AVF and the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale in children with spinal AVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-three children were included. Twenty-five children were male and 18 were female. A germline mutation was identified in 23 probands (53.5 ± 14.9%): 8 in &lt;em&gt;ENG&lt;/em&gt; (34.8 ± 14.2%), 1 in &lt;em&gt;ACVRL1&lt;/em&gt; (4.3 ± 6%) leading to a diagnosis of HHT, and 14 in &lt;em&gt;RASA1&lt;/em&gt; (60.9 ± 14.4%) leading to a diagnosis of capillary malformation/arteriovenous malformation type 1. No &lt;em&gt;EphB4&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation was identified. HHT patients presented a significantly lower rate of heart failure at diagnosis (p = 0.047). A trend toward an increased bleeding rate at presentation was observed in HHT (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.069) and an increased rate of giant venous pouch in children in whom no mutation was identified (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.097). Finally, an association with &lt;em&gt;RASA1&lt;/em&gt; mutation was observed in children with associated skin capillary hemangioma (&lt;em&gt;p &amp;lt; &lt;/em&gt; 0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the importance of genetic testing in this setting in view of the high frequency of gene mutations in pediatric cerebrospinal AVFs, and show the predominance of RASA1 over HHT mutations.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutant huntingtin protein expression and blood–spinal cord barrier dysfunction in huntington disease</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to assess the distribution, frequency, and specific location of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) aggregates-the pathological hallmark of Huntington disease (HD)-within the various compartments of the spinal cord and their potential impact on the local vasculature and blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a series of postmortem immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings, as well as Western blot analyses, on cervical and lumbar sections of the spinal cord in patients diagnosed with HD (n = 11 of all grades of disease severity) along with sex- and age-matched healthy controls (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed that mHTT was preferably expressed within the anterior horn of the gray matter, in both cervical and lumbar sections. At the cellular level, mHTT aggregates were more often encountered in the extracellular matrix but could also be observed within cell bodies and neurites as well as within the endothelium of blood vessels with an increase in the density of small blood vessels in cervical sections of HD cases. These vasculature changes were accompanied with features of BSCB leakage, as assessed by the presence of increased levels of fibrinogen in the surrounding parenchyma and enhanced leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alteration in BSCB integrity may be explained, in part, by the dysregulation we found in some of the main proteins associated with it such as junctional adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin. These observations have important implications for our understanding of HD pathology and may also have significant therapeutic implications.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Non-linear auto-regressive models for cross-frequency coupling in neural time series</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005893</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tom Dupré la Tour, Lucille Tallot, Laetitia Grabot, Valérie Doyère, Virginie van Wassenhove, Yves Grenier, Alexandre Gramfort&lt;/p&gt;

We address the issue of reliably detecting and quantifying cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in neural time series. Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model “goodness of fit” via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our parametric method can reveal neural couplings with shorter signals than non-parametric methods. We also show how the likelihood can be used to find optimal filtering parameters, suggesting new properties on the spectrum of the driving signal, but also to estimate the optimal delay between the coupled signals, enabling a directionality estimation in the coupling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gf07XBnb5Pg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Thalamocortical control of propofol phase-amplitude coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005879</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EiDZlgif6Xg/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Austin E. Soplata, Michelle M. McCarthy, Jason Sherfey, Shane Lee, Patrick L. Purdon, Emery N. Brown, Nancy Kopell&lt;/p&gt;

The anesthetic propofol elicits many different spectral properties on the EEG, including alpha oscillations (8–12 Hz), Slow Wave Oscillations (SWO, 0.1–1.5 Hz), and dose-dependent phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between alpha and SWO. Propofol is known to increase GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition and decrease H-current strength, but how it generates these rhythms and their interactions is still unknown. To investigate both generation of the alpha rhythm and its PAC to SWO, we simulate a Hodgkin-Huxley network model of a hyperpolarized thalamus and corticothalamic inputs. We find, for the first time, that the model thalamic network is capable of independently generating the sustained alpha seen in propofol, which may then be relayed to cortex and expressed on the EEG. This dose-dependent sustained alpha critically relies on propofol GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; potentiation to alter the intrinsic spindling mechanisms of the thalamus. Furthermore, the H-current conductance and background excitation of these thalamic cells must be within specific ranges to exhibit any intrinsic oscillations, including sustained alpha. We also find that, under corticothalamic SWO UP and DOWN states, thalamocortical output can exhibit maximum alpha power at either the peak or trough of this SWO; this implies the thalamus may be the source of propofol-induced PAC. Hyperpolarization level is the main determinant of whether the thalamus exhibits trough-max PAC, which is associated with lower propofol dose, or peak-max PAC, associated with higher dose. These findings suggest: the thalamus generates a novel rhythm under GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; potentiation such as under propofol, its hyperpolarization may determine whether a patient experiences trough-max or peak-max PAC, and the thalamus is a critical component of propofol-induced cortical spectral phenomena. Changes to the thalamus may be a critical part of how propofol accomplishes its effects, including unconsciousness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EiDZlgif6Xg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting the pathogenicity of novel variants in mitochondrial tRNA with MitoTIP</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanjay Sonney, Jeremy Leipzig, Marie T. Lott, Shiping Zhang, Vincent Procaccio, Douglas C. Wallace, Neal Sondheimer&lt;/p&gt;

Novel or rare variants in mitochondrial tRNA sequences may be observed after mitochondrial DNA analysis. Determining whether these variants are pathogenic is critical, but confirmation of the effect of a variant on mitochondrial function can be challenging. We have used available databases of benign and pathogenic variants, alignment between diverse tRNAs, structural information and comparative genomics to predict the impact of all possible single-base variants and deletions. The Mitochondrial tRNA Informatics Predictor (MitoTIP) is available through MITOMAP at www.mitomap.org. The source code for MitoTIP is available at www.github.com/sonneysa/MitoTIP.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1VQ29nO77z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antisense suppression of glial fibrillary acidic protein as a treatment for Alexander disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25118</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25118</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Alexander disease is a fatal leukodystrophy caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in astrocytes of the central nervous system. A key feature of pathogenesis is over-expression and accumulation of GFAP, with formation of characteristic cytoplasmic aggregates known as Rosenthal fibers. Here we investigate whether suppressing GFAP with antisense oligonucleotides could provide a therapeutic strategy for treating Alexander disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In this study we use GFAP mutant mouse models of Alexander disease to test the efficacy of antisense suppression and evaluate the effects on molecular and cellular phenotypes and non-cell autonomous toxicity. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the murine &lt;em&gt;Gfap&lt;/em&gt; transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for their ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild-type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Nearly complete and long-lasting elimination of GFAP occurred in brain and spinal cord following single bolus intracerebroventricular injections, with a striking reversal of Rosenthal fibers and downstream markers of microglial and other stress related responses. GFAP protein was also cleared from cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating its potential utility as a biomarker in future clinical applications. Finally, treatment led to improved body condition and rescue of hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These results demonstrate the efficacy of antisense suppression for an astrocyte target, and provide a compelling therapeutic approach for Alexander disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Representations of Sound in Deep Learning of Audio Features from Music. (arXiv:1712.02898v1 [cs.SD])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The work of a single musician, group or composer can vary widely in terms of
musical style. Indeed, different stylistic elements, from performance medium
and rhythm to harmony and texture, are typically exploited and developed across
an artist's lifetime. Yet, there is often a discernable character to the work
of, for instance, individual composers at the perceptual level - an experienced
listener can often pick up on subtle clues in the music to identify the
composer or performer. Here we suggest that a convolutional network may learn
these subtle clues or features given an appropriate representation of the
music. In this paper, we apply a deep convolutional neural network to a large
audio dataset and empirically evaluate its performance on audio classification
tasks. Our trained network demonstrates accurate performance on such
classification tasks when presented with 5 s examples of music obtained by
simple transformations of the raw audio waveform. A particularly interesting
example is the spectral representation of music obtained by application of a
logarithmically spaced filter bank, mirroring the early stages of auditory
signal transduction in mammals. The most successful representation of music to
facilitate discrimination was obtained via a random matrix transform (RMT).
Networks based on logarithmic filter banks and RMT were able to correctly guess
the one composer out of 31 possibilities in 68 and 84 percent of cases
respectively.

The authors note diverse cell-type-specific programs in pyramidal neuron subtypes and robust non-neuronal responses that may regulate experience-dependent neurovascular coupling and myelination.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/VH5ROaccFLA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sleep on overnight CSF amyloid-β kinetics</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are associated with future risk of Alzheimer's disease. Disrupted sleep increases soluble amyloid-β, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances to increase Alzheimer's disease risk. We tested this response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-leucine to measure amyloid-β kinetics. We found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amyloid-β-38, amyloid-β-40, and amyloid-β-42 levels by 25-30% via increased overnight amyloid-β production relative to sleeping controls. These findings suggest that disrupted sleep increases Alzheimer's disease risk via increased amyloid-β production. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Natural history of infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25101</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25101</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, typically resulting in death preceding age 2. Clinical trials in this population require an understanding of disease progression and identification of meaningful biomarkers to hasten therapeutic development and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longitudinal, multicenter, prospective natural history study enrolled 26 SMA infants and 27 control infants aged &amp;lt;6 months. Recruitment occurred at 14 centers over 21 months within the NINDS-sponsored NeuroNEXT (National Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials) Network. Infant motor function scales (Test of Infant Motor Performance Screening Items [TIMPSI], The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders, and Alberta Infant Motor Score) and putative physiological and molecular biomarkers were assessed preceding age 6 months and at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months with progression, correlations between motor function and biomarkers, and hazard ratios analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor function scores (MFS) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) decreased rapidly in SMA infants, whereas MFS in all healthy infants rapidly increased. Correlations were identified between TIMPSI and CMAP in SMA infants. TIMPSI at first study visit was associated with risk of combined endpoint of death or permanent invasive ventilation in SMA infants. Post-hoc analysis of survival to combined endpoint in SMA infants with 2 copies of &lt;em&gt;SMN2&lt;/em&gt; indicated a median age of 8 months at death (95% confidence interval, 6, 17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data of SMA and control outcome measures delineates meaningful change in clinical trials in infantile-onset SMA. The power and utility of NeuroNEXT to provide “real-world,” prospective natural history data sets to accelerate public and private drug development programs for rare disease is demonstrated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the first section, Introduction, we present our experimental design. In
the second section, we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal
electrical activity correlated with a contrast in access. In the third section,
we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity
correlated with a contrast in phenomenology and conclude characterizing the
grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity co-occurring with
unconsciousness.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining how much of the sensory information carried by a neural code
contributes to behavioral performance is key to understand sensory function and
neural information flow. However, there are as yet no analytical tools to
compute this information that lies at the intersection between sensory coding
and behavioral readout. Here we develop a novel measure, termed the
information-theoretic intersection information $I_{II}(S;R;C)$, that quantifies
how much of the sensory information carried by a neural response R is used for
behavior during perceptual discrimination tasks. Building on the Partial
Information Decomposition framework, we define $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ as the part of
the mutual information between the stimulus S and the response R that also
informs the consequent behavioral choice C. We compute $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ in the
analysis of two experimental cortical datasets, to show how this measure can be
used to compare quantitatively the contributions of spike timing and spike
rates to task performance, and to identify brain areas or neural populations
that specifically transform sensory information into choice.

Computational biology is an interdisciplinary field, and many computational biology research projects involve distributed teams of scientists. To accomplish their work, these teams must overcome both disciplinary and geographic barriers. Introducing new training paradigms is one way to facilitate research progress in computational biology. Here, we describe a new undergraduate program in biomolecular structure prediction and design in which students conduct research at labs located at geographically-distributed institutions while remaining connected through an online community. This 10-week summer program begins with one week of training on computational biology methods development, transitions to eight weeks of research, and culminates in one week at the Rosetta annual conference. To date, two cohorts of students have participated, tackling research topics including vaccine design, enzyme design, protein-based materials, glycoprotein modeling, crowd-sourced science, RNA processing, hydrogen bond networks, and amyloid formation. Students in the program report outcomes comparable to students who participate in similar in-person programs. These outcomes include the development of a sense of community and increases in their scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, and science values, all predictors of continuing in a science research career. Furthermore, the program attracted students from diverse backgrounds, which demonstrates the potential of this approach to broaden the participation of young scientists from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in computational biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tVxiwYI9Ryc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automated classification of dolphin echolocation click types from the Gulf of Mexico</title>

Delphinids produce large numbers of short duration, broadband echolocation clicks which may be useful for species classification in passive acoustic monitoring efforts. A challenge in echolocation click classification is to overcome the many sources of variability to recognize underlying patterns across many detections. An automated unsupervised network-based classification method was developed to simulate the approach a human analyst uses when categorizing click types: Clusters of similar clicks were identified by incorporating multiple click characteristics (spectral shape and inter-click interval distributions) to distinguish within-type from between-type variation, and identify distinct, persistent click types. Once click types were established, an algorithm for classifying novel detections using existing clusters was tested. The automated classification method was applied to a dataset of 52 million clicks detected across five monitoring sites over two years in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Seven distinct click types were identified, one of which is known to be associated with an acoustically identifiable delphinid (Risso’s dolphin) and six of which are not yet identified. All types occurred at multiple monitoring locations, but the relative occurrence of types varied, particularly between continental shelf and slope locations. Automatically-identified click types from autonomous seafloor recorders without verifiable species identification were compared with clicks detected on sea-surface towed hydrophone arrays in the presence of visually identified delphinid species. These comparisons suggest potential species identities for the animals producing some echolocation click types. The network-based classification method presented here is effective for rapid, unsupervised delphinid click classification across large datasets in which the click types may not be known &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a_L8itdWy3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The second aim was to determine whether these putative hypersensitive terminals could constitute a significant target for drugs effective in RLS, including dopamine agonists (pramipexole and ropinirole) and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ ligands (gabapentin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The method also allows analysis of the effect of local perfusion of compounds within the same area being sampled for glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Both hypersensitive and control glutamatergic terminals were significant targets for locally perfused pramipexole, ropinirole, and gabapentin, which significantly counteracted optogenetically induced glutamate release. The use of selective antagonists demonstrated the involvement of dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes in the effects of pramipexole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We recently identified a defect in repetitive firing of lower motor neurons as a novel contributor to intensive care unit acquired weakness. To develop therapy for intensive care unit acquired weakness, it was necessary to determine the mechanism underlying the defect in repetitive firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It has been shown previously that pharmacologic activation of serotonin receptors on motor neurons increases motor neuron excitability, in part by enhancing subthreshold voltage-activated inward currents. Administration of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved serotonin agonist (lorcaserin) to septic rats greatly improved repetitive firing and motor unit force generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, the relationship between sensory modalities and function of regenerated fibers is uncertain. We have investigated the relationships between touch threshold, tactile gnosis, and mechanoreceptor and sensory fiber function after nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Quantitative sensory hand function and sensory conduction studies by near-nerve technique, including tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors, were followed for 2 years, and results were compared to noninjured hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) remained dispersed and areas recovered to 23 ± 2% and the amplitudes only to 7 ± 1% (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The areas of SNAPs after tactile stimulation recovered to 61 ± 11% and remained slowed. Touch sensation correlated with SNAP areas (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005) and was negatively related to the prolongation of tactile latencies (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); tactile gnosis was not related to electrophysiological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recovered function of regenerated peripheral nerve fibers and reinnervated mechanoreceptors may differentially influence recovery of sensory modalities. Touch was affected by the number and function of regenerated fibers and mechanoreceptors. In contrast, tactile gnosis depends on the input and plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS), which may explain the absence of a direct relation between electrophysiological parameters and poor recovery. Dispersed maturation of sensory nerve fibers with desynchronized inputs to the CNS also contributes to the poor recovery of tactile gnosis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maps of Visual Importance. (arXiv:1712.02142v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The importance of an element in a visual stimulus is commonly associated with
the fixations during a free-viewing task. We argue that fixations are not
always correlated with attention or awareness of visual objects. We suggest to
filter the fixations recorded during exploration of the image based on the
fixations recorded during recalling the image against a neutral background.
This idea exploits that eye movements are a spatial index into the memory of a
visual stimulus. We perform an experiment in which we record the eye movements
of 30 observers during the presentation and recollection of 100 images. The
locations of fixations during recall are only qualitatively related to the
fixations during exploration. We develop a deformation mapping technique to
align the fixations from recall with the fixation during exploration. This
allows filtering the fixations based on proximity and a threshold on proximity
provides a convenient slider to control the amount of filtering. Analyzing the
spatial histograms resulting from the filtering procedure as well as the set of
removed fixations shows that certain types of scene elements, which could be
considered irrelevant, are removed. In this sense, they provide a measure of
importance of visual elements for human observers.

	<description>Early brain activity is crucial for neurogenesis and the development of brain networks. However, it has been challenging to localize regions in the developing human brain that contribute to spontaneous waves of neuronal activity. Recently, Arichi and colleagues reported that the temporal and heteromodal insular cortices have a central role in propagating these neural instructional signals.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous lifelong development and learning is a fundamental capability of
humans, differentiating them from current deep learning systems. However, other
branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards
autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and
natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide
exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep
learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made
great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human
learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human
capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data,
leveraging compositional representations and priors like intuitive physics and
psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL
systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap,
that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al.
These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning.
They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future.
Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific
objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of
large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended
repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value,
and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and
social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes
are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a
progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are
explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and
timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through
bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time,
and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of
Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et
al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and
neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational

	<description>Bioprinting is a method by which a cell-encapsulating bioink is patterned to create complex tissue architectures. Given the potential impact of this technology on neural research, we review the current state-of-the-art approaches for bioprinting neural tissues. While 2D neural cultures are ubiquitous for studying neural cells, 3D cultures can more accurately replicate the microenvironment of neural tissues. By bioprinting neuronal constructs, one can precisely control the microenvironment by specifically formulating the bioink for neural tissues, and by spatially patterning cell types and scaffold properties in three dimensions.</description>

Being very ill did not hinder his determination, as he was continuing full speed in his research, keeping several collaborations in parallel, writing papers, and giving talks until the very last moment. Impressively, John gave an excellent talk on his work on synaptic plasticity at Brandeis University from his hospital bed in the ICU. In his long scientific career, John made numerous scientific contributions that have shaped the field of neuroscience, spanning from novel insights on second-messenger cascades to human memory.</description>

	<description>Spoken languages such as German are extremely discrete, whereas others such as Portuguese are melodic or “sing-song” wherein identifying a word relies on what comes before and after. Perhaps surprisingly, birdsong also exhibits specificity and generalization as articulated by Tian and Brainard.</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of 142 positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies that have investigated striatal presynaptic dopamine function in Parkinson disease (PD) was performed. Subregional estimates of striatal dopamine metabolism are presented. The aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) defect appears to be consistently smaller than the dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 defects, suggesting upregulation of AADC function in PD. The correlation between disease severity and dopamine loss appears linear, but the majority of longitudinal studies point to a negative exponential progression pattern of dopamine loss in PD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A localized pallidal physiomarker in cervical dystonia</title>

In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (ρ = 0.4, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (ρ = 0.5, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (ρ = 0.23, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (ρ = 0.38, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coupled Molecular Feedback Loops Maintain Synaptic Long-Term Potentiation: A Computational Model. (arXiv:1712.00683v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00683</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00683</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain stores memories by adjusting the strengths of connections between
neurons. Such synaptic plasticity comes in different forms that strengthen or
weaken synapses and range from very short-lived to long-lasting. One of the
most well-studied forms of plasticity is long-term potentiation, LTP, a
phenomenon whereby synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to
stimulation. Different forms of LTP are known to play important roles in both
short-term and long-term memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many different proteins have been identified in the sub-cellular molecular
processes that are involved in LTP. An important question is how these
proteins, with lifetimes measured in hours or days, can maintain memories for
months or years. We present a computational model that shows how this problem
can be solved by two interconnected feedback loops of molecular reactions, one
involving the atypical protein kinase PKM{\zeta} and its messenger RNA, the
other involving PKM{\zeta} and GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. The model
demonstrates that robust bistability - stable equilibria in the synapse's
potentiated and unpotentiated states - can arise from simple molecular
reactions. Our simulations are able to account for a wide range of empirical
results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory
reconsolidation and the effect of different pharmaceutical interventions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional brain networks reveal the existence of cognitive reserve and the interplay between network topology and dynamics. (arXiv:1712.00462v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00462</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00462</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated how the organization of functional brain networks was related
to cognitive reserve (CR) during a memory task in healthy aging. We obtained
the magnetoencephalographic functional networks of 20 elders with a high or low
CR level to analyse the differences at network features. We reported a negative
correlation between synchronization of the whole network and CR, and observed
differences both at the node and at the network level in: the average shortest
path and the network outreach. Individuals with high CR required functional
networks with lower links to successfully carry out the memory task. These
results may indicate that those individuals with low CR level exhibited a dual
pattern of compensation and network impairment, since their functioning was
more energetically costly to perform the task as the high CR group.
Additionally, we evaluated how the dynamical properties of the different brain
regions were correlated to the network parameters obtaining that entropy was
positively correlated with the strength and clustering coefficient, while
complexity behaved conversely. Consequently, highly connected nodes of the
functional networks showed a more stochastic and less complex signal. We
consider that network approach may be a relevant tool to better understand
brain functioning in aging.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Oleksandr Ostrenko, Pietro Incardona, Rajesh Ramaswamy, Lutz Brusch, Ivo F. Sbalzarini&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical reaction networks are ubiquitous in biology, and their dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we present the software library pSSAlib, which provides a complete and concise implementation of the most efficient partial-propensity methods for simulating exact stochastic chemical kinetics. pSSAlib can import models encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, supports time delays in chemical reactions, and stochastic spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion systems. It also provides tools for statistical analysis of simulation results and supports multiple output formats. It has previously been used for studies of biochemical reaction pathways and to benchmark other stochastic simulation methods. Here, we describe pSSAlib in detail and apply it to a new model of the endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells, leading to the discovery of a stochastic counterpart of the cut-out switch motif underlying early-to-late endosome conversion. pSSAlib is provided as a stand-alone command-line tool and as a developer API. We also provide a plug-in for the SBMLToolbox. The open-source code and pre-packaged installers are freely available from http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mOauxiRU7Zc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Efficient encoding of motion is mediated by gap junctions in the fly visual system</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Siwei Wang, Alexander Borst, Noga Zaslavsky, Naftali Tishby, Idan Segev&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the computational implications of specific synaptic connectivity patterns is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In particular, the computational role of ubiquitous electrical synapses operating via gap junctions remains elusive. In the fly visual system, the cells in the vertical-system network, which play a key role in visual processing, primarily connect to each other via axonal gap junctions. This network therefore provides a unique opportunity to explore the functional role of gap junctions in sensory information processing. Our information theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that within 10 ms following the onset of the visual input, the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly’s ego motion. This encoding efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. The VS network is known to be connected to downstream pathways via a subset of triplets of the vertical system cells; we found that because of the axonal gap junctions, the efficiency of this subpopulation in encoding θ is superior to that of the whole vertical system network and is robust to a wide range of signal to noise ratios. We further demonstrate that this efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Because gap junctions are formed among the axons of the vertical system cells, they only impact the system’s readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, suggesting that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously appreciated based on point neuron models. Our study provides new insights as to how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gB67vf_2z4E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;: We aimed to identify if acute ischemic stroke patients with known complete reperfusion after thrombectomy had the same baseline CTP ischemic core threshold to predict infarction as thrombolysis patients with complete reperfusion. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Patients who underwent thrombectomy were matched by age, clinical severity, occlusion location, and baseline perfusion lesion volume to patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase alone from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry. A pixel-based analysis of co-registered pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) and 24 hour diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was then undertaken to define the optimum CTP thresholds for the ischemic core. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: There were 132 eligible thrombectomy patients and 132 matched controls treated with alteplase alone. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (median 15, IQR 11-19), age (median 65, IQR 59 - 80) and time to IV treatment (median 153min, IQR 82- 315min) were well-matched (all p&amp;gt;0.05). Despite similar baseline CTP ischemic core volumes using the previously validated measure (rCBF &amp;lt;30%), thrombectomy patients had a smaller median 24 hour infarct core of 17.3mL (IQR 11.3-32.8mL) versus 24.3 mL (IQR 16.7-42.2mL, p=0.011) in alteplase-treated controls. As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (AUC 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.94), while in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.85). &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Thrombectomy salvaged tissue with lower CBF, likely due to earlier reperfusion. For patients who achieve rapid reperfusion, a stricter rCBF threshold to estimate the ischemic core should be considered. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraine aura is sparsely studied due to the highly challenging task of capturing patients during aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is likely the underlying phenomenon of aura. The possible correlation between the multifaceted phenomenology of aura symptoms and the effects of CSD on the brain has not been ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five migraine patients were studied during various forms of aura symptoms induced by hypoxia, sham hypoxia, or physical exercise with concurrent photostimulation. The blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal response to visual stimulation was measured in retinotopic mapping–defined visual cortex areas V1 to V4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found reduced BOLD response in patients reporting scotoma and increased response in patients who only experienced positive symptoms. Furthermore, patients with bilateral visual symptoms had corresponding bihemispherical changes in BOLD response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that different aura symptoms reflect different types of cerebral dysfunction, which correspond to specific changes in BOLD signal reactivity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of bilateral CSD recorded by fMRI during bilateral aura symptoms. Ann Neurol 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with delayed fast inhibitory feedback and without feedback. (arXiv:1712.00359v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00359</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a class of spiking neuronal models, defined by a set of
conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as the leaky
integrate-and-fire or the binding neuron model and also for some artificial
neurons. A neuron is fed with a renewal process. Each output impulse is applied
to the neuron itself after a finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse acts as being
delivered through a fast Cl-type inhibitory synapse. We derive a general
relation which allows calculating exactly the probability density function
(pdf) $p(t)$ of output interspike intervals of a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback and on the properties
of the feedback line (the $\Delta$ value). Similar relations between
corresponding moments are derived. Furthermore, we prove that initial segment
of pdf $p^0(t)$ for a neuron with a fixed threshold level is the same for any
neuron satisfying the imposed conditions and is completely determined by the
input stream. For the Poisson input stream, we calculate that initial segment
exactly and, based on it, obtain exactly the initial segment of pdf $p(t)$ for
a neuron with feedback. That is the initial segment of $p(t)$ is
model-independent as well. The obtained expressions are checked by means of
Monte Carlo simulation. The course of $p(t)$ has a pronounced peculiarity,
which makes it impossible to approximate $p(t)$ by Poisson or another simple
stochastic process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Interplay of activation kinetics and the derivative conductance determines the resonance properties of neurons. (arXiv:1712.00306v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00306</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a neuron with hyperpolarization activated current ($I_h$), the correct
input frequency leads to an enhancement of the output response. This behavior
is known as resonance and is well described by the neuronal impedance. In a
simple neuron model we derive equations for the neuron's resonance and we link
its frequency and existence with the biophysical properties of $I_h$. For a
small voltage change, the component of the ratio of current change to voltage
change ($dI/dV$) due to the voltage-dependent conductance change ($dg/dV$) is
known as derivative conductance ($G_h^{Der}$). We show that both $G_h^{Der}$
and the current activation kinetics (characterized by the activation time
constant $\tau_h$) are mainly responsible for controlling the frequency and
existence of resonance. The increment of both factors ($G_h^{Der}$ and
$\tau_h$) greatly contributes to the appearance of resonance. We also
demonstrate that resonance is voltage dependent due to the voltage dependence
of $G_h^{Der}$. Our results have important implications and can be used to
predict and explain resonance properties of neurons with the $I_h$ current.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is one of the most complex living structures in the known
Universe. It consists of billions of neurons and synapses. Due to its intrinsic
complexity, it can be a formidable task to accurately depict brain's structure
and functionality. In the past, numerous studies have been conducted on
modeling brain disease, structure, and functionality. Some of these studies
have employed Agent-based approaches including multiagent-based simulation
models as well as brain complex networks. While these models have all been
developed using agent-based computing, however, to our best knowledge, none of
them have employed the use of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)
methodologies in developing the brain or disease model. This is a problem
because without due process, developed models can miss out on important
requirements. AOSE has the unique capability of merging concepts from
multiagent systems, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, besides
concepts from distributed systems. AOSE involves the various tested software
engineering principles in various phases of the model development ranging from
analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. In this paper, we employ
the use of three different AOSE methodologies for modeling the Multiple
Sclerosis brain disease namely GAIA, TROPOS, and MASE. After developing the
models, we further employ the use of Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM) to
develop an actual model replicating previous results as a proof of concept. The
key objective of this study is to demonstrate and explore the viability and
effectiveness of AOSE methodologies in the development of complex brain
structure and cognitive process models. Our key finding include demonstration
that AOSE methodologies can be considerably helpful in modeling various living
complex systems, in general, and the human brain, in particular.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The identity of information: how deterministic dependencies constrain information synergy and redundancy. (arXiv:1711.11408v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11408</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how different information sources together transmit information
is crucial in many domains. For example, understanding the neural code requires
characterizing how different neurons contribute unique, redundant, or
synergistic pieces of information about sensory or behavioral variables.
Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a partial information decomposition (PID)
which separates the mutual information that a set of sources contains about a
set of targets into nonnegative terms interpretable as these pieces.
Quantifying redundancy requires assigning an identity to different information
pieces, to assess when information is common across sources. Harder et al.
(2013) proposed an identity axiom stating that there cannot be redundancy
between two independent sources about a copy of themselves. However,
Bertschinger et al. (2012) showed that with a deterministically related
sources-target copy this axiom is incompatible with ensuring PID nonnegativity.
Here we study systematically the effect of deterministic target-sources
dependencies. We introduce two synergy stochasticity axioms that generalize the
identity axiom, and we derive general expressions separating stochastic and
deterministic PID components. Our analysis identifies how negative terms can
originate from deterministic dependencies and shows how different assumptions
on information identity, implicit in the stochasticity and identity axioms,
determine the PID structure. The implications for studying neural coding are
discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mapping the human structural connectome, we are in a very fortunate
situation: one can compute and compare graphs, describing the cerebral
connections between the very same, anatomically identified small regions of the
gray matter among hundreds of human subjects. The comparison of these graphs
has led to numerous recent results, as the (i) discovery that women's
connectomes have deeper and richer connectivity-related graph parameters like
those of men, or (ii) the description of more and less conservatively connected
lobes and cerebral regions, and (iii) the discovery of the phenomenon of the
Consensus Connectome Dynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today one of the greatest challenges of brain science is the description and
modeling of the circuitry of the human brain. For this goal, we need to
identify sub-circuits that are present in almost all human subjects and those,
which are much less frequent: the former sub-circuits most probably have
functions with general importance, the latter sub-circuits are probably related
to the individual variability of the brain structure and functions. The present
contribution describes the frequent connected subgraphs (instead of
sub-circuits) of at most 6 edges in the human brain. We analyze these frequent
graphs and also examine sex differences in these graphs: we demonstrate
numerous connected sub-graphs that are more frequent in female or the male
connectome. While our results describe subgraphs, instead of sub-circuits, we
need to note that all macroscopic sub-circuits correspond to an underlying
connected subgraph.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data source is the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and we
are applying the data of 426 human subjects in this study.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Polarity Sorting of Microtubules in the Axon</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30214-X?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30214-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>A longstanding question in cellular neuroscience is how microtubules in the axon become organized with their plus ends out, a pattern starkly different from the mixed orientation of microtubules in vertebrate dendrites. Recent attention has focused on a mechanism called polarity sorting, in which microtubules of opposite orientation are spatially separated by molecular motor proteins. Here we discuss this mechanism, and conclude that microtubules are polarity sorted in the axon by cytoplasmic dynein but that additional factors are also needed.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The underdog pathway gets a boost&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underdog pathway gets a boost, Published online: 28 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0019-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0019-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sommeijer et al. describe a previously unrecognized role of the thalamus: development of inhibition in the thalamus regulates ocular dominance plasticity, a form of critical-period plasticity regulation previously ascribed solely to the cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/YNj6HO3MMjE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Neuroscience - Issue - nature.com science feeds: Whole genome sequencing in psychiatric disorders: the WGSPD consortium</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole genome sequencing in psychiatric disorders: the WGSPD consortium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole genome sequencing in psychiatric disorders: the WGSPD consortium, Published online: 28 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0017-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0017-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As technology advances, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is likely to supersede other genotyping technologies. The rate of this change depends on its relative cost and utility. Variants identified uniquely through WGS may reveal novel biological pathways underlying complex disorders and provide high-resolution insight into when, where, and in which cell type these pathways are affected. Alternatively, cheaper and less computationally intensive approaches may yield equivalent insights. Understanding the role of rare variants in the noncoding gene-regulating genome through pilot WGS projects will be critical to determining which of these two extremes best represents reality. With large cohorts, well-defined risk loci, and a compelling need to understand the underlying biology, psychiatric disorders have a role to play in this preliminary WGS assessment. The Whole Genome Sequencing for Psychiatric Disorders Consortium will integrate data for 18,000 individuals with psychiatric disorders, beginning with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, along with over 150,000 controls.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lduqf_2TMTE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The quantities of the different nutrients are represented in distinct parts of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and then integrated by the medial orbitofrontal cortex to provide a global value judgment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/9PQKigIx9eA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An opening for humor in melancholy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An opening for humor in melancholy, Published online: 28 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0015-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0015-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A leaky blood–brain barrier may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease. Chronic stress is shown to alter blood–brain barrier permeability, allowing an inflammatory response to penetrate the brain. The deficit is mostly around the nucleus accumbens, an area central to motivation. The affected animals exhibit features of depression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/MqBans4FIV4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lineage divergence of activity-driven transcription and evolution of cognitive ability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lineage divergence of activity-driven transcription and evolution of cognitive ability, Published online: 23 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.138&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.138&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Activity-driven changes in gene transcription regulate synaptic development and function. Bading and colleagues describe recent evidence of lineage-specific changes in the gene regulatory regions that govern excitation–transcription coupling and consider how such changes may have contributed to the evolution of human cognitive abilities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/5ZmTIrFnc84&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
