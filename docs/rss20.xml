	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Changes in the cerebral cortex of mammals during evolution have been of great interest. Ferrets, monkeys, and humans have more developed cerebral cortices compared with mice. Although the features of progenitors in the developing cortices of these animals have been intensively investigated, those of the fiber layers are still largely elusive. By taking the advantage of our in utero electroporation technique for ferrets, here we systematically investigated the cellular origins and projection patterns of axonal fibers in the developing ferret cortex. We found that ferrets have 2 fiber layers in the developing cerebral cortex, as is the case in monkeys and humans. Axonal fibers in the inner fiber layer projected contralaterally and subcortically, whereas those in the outer fiber layer sent axons to neighboring cortical areas. Furthermore, we performed similar experiments using mice and found unexpected similarities between ferrets and mice. Our results shed light on the cellular origins, the projection patterns, the developmental processes, and the evolution of fiber layers in mammalian brains.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SFPEL-LPI: Sequence-based feature projection ensemble learning for predicting LncRNA-protein interactions</title>

LncRNA-protein interactions play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. Identification of lncRNA-protein interactions helps to understand lncRNA-related activities. Existing computational methods utilize multiple lncRNA features or multiple protein features to predict lncRNA-protein interactions, but features are not available for all lncRNAs or proteins; most of existing methods are not capable of predicting interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) for new lncRNAs (or proteins), which don’t have known interactions. In this paper, we propose the sequence-based feature projection ensemble learning method, “SFPEL-LPI”, to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. First, SFPEL-LPI extracts lncRNA sequence-based features and protein sequence-based features. Second, SFPEL-LPI calculates multiple lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and protein-protein similarities by using lncRNA sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein interactions. Then, SFPEL-LPI combines multiple similarities and multiple features with a feature projection ensemble learning frame. In computational experiments, SFPEL-LPI accurately predicts lncRNA-protein associations and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, SFPEL-LPI can be applied to new lncRNAs (or proteins). The case studies demonstrate that our method can find out novel lncRNA-protein interactions, which are confirmed by literature. Finally, we construct a user-friendly web server, available at http://www.bioinfotech.cn/SFPEL-LPI/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0iga8hXGIQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: PremPDI estimates and interprets the effects of missense mutations on protein-DNA interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006615</guid>

Protein-DNA interactions play important roles in regulations of many vital cellular processes, including transcription, translation, DNA replication and recombination. Sequence variants occurring in these DNA binding proteins that alter protein-DNA interactions may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of function, potentially leading to diseases. Developing a mechanistic understanding of impacts of variants on protein-DNA interactions becomes a persistent need. To address this need we introduce a new computational method PremPDI that predicts the effect of single missense mutation in the protein on the protein-DNA interaction and calculates the quantitative binding affinity change. The PremPDI method is based on molecular mechanics force fields and fast side-chain optimization algorithms with parameters optimized on experimental sets of 219 mutations from 49 protein-DNA complexes. PremPDI yields a very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and root-mean-square error of 0.86 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The PremPDI server could map mutations on a structural protein-DNA complex, calculate the associated changes in binding affinity, determine the deleterious effect of a mutation, and produce a mutant structural model for download. PremPDI can be applied to many tasks, such as determination of potential damaging mutations in cancer and other diseases. PremPDI is available at http://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPDI/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uoKVqoewtV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Over the last few years, genomic studies on Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of all known plague epidemics, have considerably increased in numbers, spanning a period of about 5,000 y. Nonetheless, questions concerning historical reservoirs and routes of transmission remain open. Here, we present and describe five genomes from the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/dXP1S71SeGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: 3DMorph Automatic Analysis of Microglial Morphology in Three Dimensions from Ex Vivo and In Vivo Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0266-18.2018?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0266-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or two-dimensional projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semiautomatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Gate-and-Switch Model for Head Orientation Behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural systems can be modeled as networks of functionally connected neural
elements. The resulting network can be analyzed using mathematical tools from
network science and graph theory to quantify the system's topological
organization and to better understand its function. While the network-based
approach is common in the analysis of large-scale neural systems probed by
non-invasive neuroimaging, few studies have used network science to study the
organization of networks reconstructed at the cellular level, and thus many
very basic and fundamental questions remain unanswered. Here, we used
two-photon calcium imaging to record spontaneous activity from the same set of
cells in mouse auditory cortex over the course of several weeks. We reconstruct
functional networks in which cells are linked to one another by edges weighted
according to the correlation of their fluorescence traces. We show that the
networks exhibit modular structure across multiple topological scales and that
these multi-scale modules unfold as part of a hierarchy. We also show that, on
average, network architecture becomes increasingly dissimilar over time, with
similarity decaying monotonically with the distance (in time) between sessions.
Finally, we show that a small fraction of cells maintain strongly-correlated
activity over multiple days, forming a stable temporal core surrounded by a
fluctuating and variable periphery. Our work provides a careful methodological
blueprint for future studies of spontaneous activity measured by two-photon
calcium imaging using cutting-edge computational methods and machine learning
algorithms informed by explicit graphical models from network science. The
methods are easily extended to additional datasets, opening the possibility of
studying cellular level network organization of neural systems and how that
organization is modulated by stimuli or altered in models of disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Guided Graph Spectral Embedding: Application to the C. elegans Connectome. (arXiv:1812.03684v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Graph spectral analysis can yield meaningful embeddings of graphs by
providing insight into distributed features not directly accessible in nodal
domain. Recent efforts in graph signal processing have proposed new
decompositions-e.g., based on wavelets and Slepians-that can be applied to
filter signals defined on the graph. In this work, we take inspiration from
these constructions to define a new guided spectral embedding that combines
maximizing energy concentration with minimizing modified embedded distance for
a given importance weighting of the nodes. We show these optimization goals are
intrinsically opposite, leading to a well-defined and stable spectral
decomposition. The importance weighting allows to put the focus on particular
nodes and tune the trade-off between global and local effects. Following the
derivation of our new optimization criterion and its linear approximation, we
exemplify the methodology on the C. elegans structural connectome. The results
of our analyses confirm known observations on the nematode's neural network in
terms of functionality and importance of cells. Compared to Laplacian
embedding, the guided approach, focused on a certain class of cells (sensory,
inter- and motoneurons), provides more biological insights, such as the
distinction between somatic positions of cells, and their involvement in low or
high order processing functions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Role of NMDA conductance in average firing rate shifts caused by external periodic forcing. (arXiv:1812.03609v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03609</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03609</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A widely accepted view of computations in the brain relies on population
coding, where the neural ensemble firing rate is modulated in a stable manner
to transmit information and perform various cognitive tasks. At the same time,
oscillatory neural activity is specifically modulated in frequency, coherence
and power during cognitive performance. How the firing rate and oscillations
interact remains a salient question. In this paper, we develop a theory for the
interactions between oscillatory signals and the firing rate of neural
populations based on activity of non-linear voltage-dependent NMDA synapses.
Notably, we show under which conditions oscillatory inputs can control the mean
firing rate without loss of stability. Using mathematical analysis and
simulations of mean-field models, we demonstrate that presence of NMDA synapses
on both the excitatory and the inhibitory neurons is critical for sinusoidal
oscillations to significantly and stably increase the firing rate. We
characterize the oscillation-induced mean firing rate shift as a function of
the fast and slow synaptic weights and demonstrate the parameter region, in
which the effect under investigation is mostly pronounced. Results of our work
may help identify the properties of neural circuits that allow for constructive
control of the firing rate codes by large-scale neural oscillations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Macroscopic phase resetting-curves determine oscillatory coherence and signal transfer in inter-coupled neural circuits. (arXiv:1812.03455v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03455</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03455</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic oscillations of different brain regions show multiple phase
relationships that are persistent across time and have been implicated routing
information. Various cellular level mechanisms influence the network dynamics
and structure the macroscopic firing patterns. Key question is to identify the
biophysical neuronal and synaptic properties that permit such motifs to arise
and how the different coherence states determine the communication between the
neural circuits. We analyse the emergence of phase locking within
bidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits showing global gamma band
oscillations. We consider both the interneuronal (ING) and the
pyramidal-interneuronal (PING) gamma rhythms and the inter coupling targeting
the pyramidal or the inhibitory interneurons. Using a mean-field approach
together with an exact reduction method, we break down each spiking network
into a low dimensional nonlinear system and derive the macroscopic phase
resetting-curves (mPRCs) that determine how the phase of the global oscillation
responds to incoming perturbations. Depending on the type of gamma oscillation,
we show that incoming excitatory inputs can either only speed up the
oscillation (phase advance; type I PRC) or induce both an advance and a delay
the macroscopic oscillation (phase delay; type II PRC). From there we determine
the structure of macroscopic coherence states (phase locking) of two weakly
synaptically-coupled networks. To do so we derive a phase equation for the
coupled system which links the synaptic mechanisms to the coherence state of
the system. We show that the transmission delay is a necessary condition for
symmetry breaking, i.e. a non-symmetric phase lag between the macroscopic
oscillations, potentially giving an explanation to the experimentally observed
variety of gamma phase-locking modes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The lure of causal statements: Rampant mis-inference of causality in estimated connectivity. (arXiv:1812.03363v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03363</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03363</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As neuroscientists we want to understand how causal interactions or
mechanisms within the brain give rise to perception, cognition, and behavior.
It is typical to estimate interaction effects from measured activity using
statistical techniques such as functional connectivity, Granger Causality,or
information flow, whose outcomes are often falsely treated as revealing
mechanistic insight. Since these statistical techniques fit models to
low-dimensional measurements from brains, they ignore the fact that brain
activity is high-dimensional. Here we focus on the obvious confound of common
inputs: the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the
few observed ones. Any given observed correlation can be explained by an
infinite set of causal models that take into account the unobserved variables.
Therefore, correlations within massively undersampled measurements tell us
little about mechanisms. We argue that these mis-inferences of causality from
correlation are augmented by an implicit redefinition of words that suggest
mechanisms, such as connectivity, causality, and flow.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: HIPPO signaling resolves embryonic cell fate conflicts during establishment of pluripotency in vivo</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42298</link>
	<description>During mammalian development, the challenge for the embryo is to override intrinsic cellular plasticity to drive cells to distinct fates. Here, we unveil novel roles for the HIPPO signaling pathway in controlling cell positioning and expression of &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt;, the first marker of pluripotency in the mouse early embryo. We show that maternal and zygotic YAP1 and WWTR1 repress &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; while promoting expression of the trophectoderm gene &lt;i&gt;Cdx2&lt;/i&gt; in parallel. Yet, &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; is more sensitive than &lt;i&gt;Cdx2&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Yap1/Wwtr1&lt;/i&gt; dosage, leading cells to a state of conflicted cell fate when YAP1/WWTR1 activity is moderate. Remarkably, HIPPO signaling activity resolves conflicted cell fate by repositioning cells to the interior of the embryo, independent of its role in regulating &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Rather, HIPPO antagonizes apical localization of Par complex components PARD6B and aPKC. Thus, negative feedback between HIPPO and Par complex components ensure robust lineage segregation.</description>

	<description>In human large conductance voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium (BK) channels are regulated allosterically by transmembrane voltage and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Divalent cation binding sites reside within the gating ring formed by two Regulator of Conductance of Potassium (RCK) domains per subunit. Using patch-clamp fluorometry, we show that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding to the RCK1 domain triggers gating ring rearrangements that depend on transmembrane voltage. Because the gating ring is outside the electric field, this voltage sensitivity must originate from coupling to the voltage-dependent channel opening, the voltage sensor or both. Here we demonstrate that alterations of the voltage sensor, either by mutagenesis or regulation by auxiliary subunits, are paralleled by changes in the voltage dependence of the gating ring movements, whereas modifications of the relative open probability are not. These results strongly suggest that conformational changes of RCK1 domains are specifically coupled to the voltage sensor function during allosteric modulation of BK channels.</description>

	<description>We reconstructed, from a whole CNS EM volume, the synaptic map of input and output neurons that underlie food intake behavior of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae. Input neurons originate from enteric, pharyngeal and external sensory organs and converge onto seven distinct sensory synaptic compartments within the CNS. Output neurons consist of feeding motor, serotonergic modulatory and neuroendocrine neurons. Monosynaptic connections from a set of sensory synaptic compartments cover the motor, modulatory and neuroendocrine targets in overlapping domains. Polysynaptic routes are superimposed on top of monosynaptic connections, resulting in divergent sensory paths that converge on common outputs. A completely different set of sensory compartments is connected to the mushroom body calyx. The mushroom body output neurons are connected to interneurons that directly target the feeding output neurons. Our results illustrate a circuit architecture in which monosynaptic and multisynaptic connections from sensory inputs traverse onto output neurons via a series of converging paths.</description>

	<description>As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/&quot;&gt;Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt; we published a Registered Report (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib30&quot;&gt;Lesnik et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib36&quot;&gt;Peinado et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Here we report the results. We regenerated tumor cells stably expressing a short hairpin to reduce Met expression (shMet) using the same highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell line (B16-F10) as the original study, which efficiently downregulated Met in B16F10 cells similar to the original study (Supplementary Figure 5A; &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib36&quot;&gt;Peinado et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Exosomes from control cells expressed Met, which was reduced in exosomes from shMet cells; however, we were unable to reliably detect phosphorylated Met in exosomes. We tested the effect of exosome-dependent Met signaling on primary tumor growth and metastasis. Similar to the results in the original study, we did not find a statistically significant change in primary tumor growth. Measuring lung and femur metastases, we found a small increase in metastatic burden with exosomes from control cells that was diminished when Met expression was reduced; however, while the effects were in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4E; &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib36&quot;&gt;Peinado et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;), they were not statistically significant. Differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as level of knockdown efficiency, cell line genetic drift, sample sizes, study endpoints, and variability of observed metastatic burden, are factors that might have influenced the outcomes. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</description>

	<description>Successful treatment decisions in cancer depend on the accurate assessment of patient risk. To improve our understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie deadly malignancies, we analyzed the genomic profiles of 17,879 tumors from patients with known outcomes. We find that mutations in almost all cancer driver genes contain remarkably little information on patient prognosis. However, CNAs in these same driver genes harbor significant prognostic power. Focal CNAs are associated with worse outcomes than broad alterations, and CNAs in many driver genes remain prognostic when controlling for stage, grade, &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; status, and total aneuploidy. By performing a meta-analysis across independent patient cohorts, we identify robust prognostic biomarkers in specific cancer types, and we demonstrate that a subset of these alterations also confer specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. In total, our analysis establishes a comprehensive resource for cancer biomarker identification and underscores the importance of gene copy number profiling in assessing clinical risk.</description>

	<description>Protein histidine methylation is a rare post-translational modification of unknown biochemical importance. In vertebrates, only a few methylhistidine-containing proteins have been reported, including β-actin as an essential example. The evolutionary conserved methylation of β-actin H73 is catalyzed by an as yet unknown histidine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase. We report here that the protein SETD3 is the actin-specific histidine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase. In vitro, recombinant rat and human SETD3 methylated β-actin at H73. Knocking-out SETD3 in both human HAP1 cells and in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; resulted in the absence of methylation at β-actin H73 in vivo, whereas β-actin from wildtype cells or flies was &amp;gt; 90% methylated. As a consequence, we show that Setd3-deficient HAP1 cells have less cellular F-actin and an increased glycolytic phenotype. In conclusion, by identifying SETD3 as the actin-specific histidine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase, our work pioneers new research into the possible role of this modification in health and disease and questions the substrate specificity of SET-domain-containing enzymes.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Tau monomer encodes strains</title>

	<description>Tauopathies have diverse presentation, progression, and neuropathology. They are linked to tau prion strains, self-replicating assemblies of unique quaternary conformation, whose origin is unknown. Strains can be propagated indefinitely in cultured cells, and induce unique patterns of transmissible neuropathology upon inoculation into mice. DS9 and DS10 cell lines propagate different synthetic strains that derive from recombinant tau. We previously observed that tau monomer adopts two conformational states: one that is inert (M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and one that is seed-competent (M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib10&quot;&gt;Mirbaha et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). We have now found that M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; itself is comprised of multiple stable ensembles that encode unique strains. DS9 monomer inoculated into naive cells encoded only DS9, whereas DS10 monomer encoded multiple sub-strains. Sub-strains each induced distinct pathology upon inoculation into a tauopathy mouse model (PS19). M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; purified from an Alzeimer's disease brain encoded a single strain. Conversely, M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; from a corticobasal degeneration brain encoded three sub-strains, in which monomer from any one re-established all three upon inoculation into cells. Seed competent tau monomer thus adopts multiple, stable seed-competent conformations, each of which encodes a limited number of strains. This provides insight into the emergence of distinct tauopathies, and may improve diagnosis and therapy.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Evolution of cation binding in the active sites of P-loop nucleoside triphosphatases in relation to the basic catalytic mechanism</title>

	<description>The ubiquitous P-loop fold nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases) are typically activated by an arginine or lysine 'finger'. Some of the apparently ancestral NTPases are, instead, activated by potassium ions. To clarify the activation mechanism, we combined comparative structure analysis with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Mg-ATP and Mg-GTP complexes in water and in the presence of potassium, sodium, or ammonium ions. In all analyzed structures of diverse P-loop NTPases, the conserved P-loop motif keeps the triphosphate chain of bound NTPs (or their analogs) in an extended, catalytically prone conformation, similar to that imposed on NTPs in water by potassium or ammonium ions. MD simulations of potassium-dependent GTPase MnmE showed that linking of alpha- and gamma phosphates by the activating potassium ion led to the rotation of the gamma-phosphate group yielding an almost eclipsed, catalytically productive conformation of the triphosphate chain, which could represent the basic mechanism of hydrolysis by P-loop NTPases.</description>

	<description>Memory exists across different time scales. Long-term memories can last a lifetime, while working memory persists for mere seconds. In between, memories that are newly formed—or recently recalled—are more vivid than latent ones. How does this happen? The act of memory recall increases the excitability of whole engram cells for about one hour. This short-term increase of engram cell excitability facilitates synaptic access to memory content in response to relevant environmental cues.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diffeomorphic registration with intensity transformation and missing data: Application to 3D digital pathology of Alzheimer\'s disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/494005v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/494005v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>This paper examines the problem of diffeomorphic image mapping in the presence of differing image intensity profiles and missing data. Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100 micron isotropic resolution, to histology sections with 1 micron in plane resolution. Multiple stains, as well as damaged, folded, or missing tissue are common in this situation. We overcome these challenges by introducing two new concepts. Cross modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity, together with pose and deformation parameters. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlases may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to ``background'' or ``artifact''. The two concepts are combined within an Expectation Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively, and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We show results for 3D reconstruction of digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. In conjunction with convolutional neural networks, we quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Physical activity in children and adolescents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: A cross-sectional case-controlled study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493908v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493908v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background Disability related to the progressive and degenerative neuropathies known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) affects gait and function, increasing with age and influencing physical activity in adults with CMT. The relationship between disease, ambulatory function and physical activity in children and adolescents with CMT is unknown. Method A cross-sectional case-controlled study of 50 children with CMT and age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) controls [mean age 12.5 (SD 3.9) years]. A 7-day recall questionnaire assessed physical activity; disease severity and gait-related function were measured to explore factors associated with physical activity. Results Children with CMT were less active than TD controls (estimated weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity CMT 283.6 (SD 211.6) mins, TD 318.0 (SD 202.5) mins; p &amp;lt; 0.001). The children with CMT had moderate disability [CMT Pediatric Scale mean score 20 (SD 8) /44] and reduced ambulatory capacity in a six-minute walk test [CMT 485.1 (SD 160.9) metres, TD 639.8 (83.1) metres; p &amp;lt; 0.001]. Physical activity correlated with greater disease severity ({rho} = -0.52, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and six-minute walk distance ({rho} = 0.71, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Disease-related disability affects physical activity and gait-related function in children and adolescents with CMT compared to TD peers. Reduced physical activity adversely affects function across the timespan of childhood and adolescence into adulthood.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Early maltreatment experience increases resting-state functional connectivity in thetheory of mind (ToM) network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493635v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493635v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Early life stressful events, such as childhood maltreatment, significantly increase risk for the development of psychopathology and are associated with impairments in socio-cognitive skills including theory-of-mind (ToM). However, to date, no study has examined the resting-state activity of the ToM network in adults with maltreatment history. Methods: Thirty-five women with a history of childhood maltreatment and 31 unaffected women completed a resting-state scan and a ToM localizer task. The peak coordinates from the localizer were used as the seed regions for the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses (temporoparietal junction, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and precuneus). Results: Child abuse was associated with increased RSFC between various ToM regions including the precuneus and the brainstem suggesting altered hierarchical processing in ToM regions. In addition, RSFC was also changed between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Limitations. A small and heterogeneous sample. Conclusions: The data indicate a lasting influence of early life stress on neural networks involved in social processing and may underlie the social difficulties reported by maltreated individuals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oxytocin effects on brain and behavior are influenced by dose-frequency and receptor genotype: therapeutic implications</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493387v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493387v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>There is considerable interest in therapeutic application of intranasal oxytocin in psychiatric disorders but while clinical trials typically use daily dosing protocols it has not been established whether this is optimal or if there are moderating influences of oxytocin receptor genotype. In a randomized, placebo-controlled pre-registered trial on 138 adult male subjects we investigated effects of single and repeated (24IU daily versus alternate days for 5 days) doses of oxytocin on two neural biomarkers (attenuated amygdala fear reactivity and increased intrinsic amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity) and modulating effects of oxytocin receptor polymorphisms rs53576 and rs2254298 strongly associated with autism. Results confirmed that after a single dose, amygdala responses to fear faces were reduced and its resting state connectivity with medial frontal cortex increased. Suppression of amygdala responses to fear faces was restricted to AA homozygotes of rs53576 and A+ carriers of rs2254298. Importantly, amygdala responses to fear faces were absent after daily oxytocin treatment but maintained after treatment every other day and included reduced ratings of emotional intensity. In contrast, effects on intrinsic amygdala-prefrontal coupling remained constant. Overall, results suggest infrequent rather than daily doses of oxytocin may be more effective therapeutically and that its actions on amygdala responses are strongly genotype-dependent.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A VTA GABAergic neural circuit mediates visually evoked innate defensive responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493007v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/493007v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Innate defensive responses are essential for animal survival and are conserved across species. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays important roles in learned appetitive and aversive behaviors, but whether it plays a role in mediating or modulating innate defensive responses is currently unknown. We report that GABAergic neurons in the mouse VTA (VTAGABA+) are preferentially activated compared to VTA dopaminergic (VTADA+) neurons when a threatening visual stimulus evokes innate defensive behavior. Functional manipulation of these neurons showed that activation of VTAGABA+ neurons is indispensable for looming-evoked defensive flight behavior and photoactivation of these neurons is sufficient for looming-evoked defensive-like flight behavior, whereas no such role can be attributed for VTADA+ neurons. Viral tracing and in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings showed that VTAGABA+ neurons receive direct excitatory inputs from the superior colliculus (SC). Furthermore, we showed that glutamatergic SC-VTA projections synapse onto VTAGABA+ neurons that project to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and that the CeA is involved in mediating the defensive behavior. Our findings demonstrate that visual information about aerial threats access to the VTAGABA+ neurons mediating innate behavioral responses, suggesting a more general role for the VTA.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Actomyosin-II facilitates long-range retrograde transport of large cargoes by controlling axonal radial contractility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492959v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492959v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Most mammalian neurons have a narrow axon, which constrains the passage of large cargoes such as autophagosome as they can be larger than the axon diameter. Variations in tension must therefore occur radially to facilitate changes in axonal diameter and ensure efficient axoplasmic trafficking. Here, we reveal that the transit of diverse large membrane-bound cargoes causes an acute, albeit transient, radial expansion of the axonal diameter, which is immediately restored by constricting forces. We demonstrate that non-muscle myosin II (NM-II) forms ~200 nm periodic structures, which associate with axonal F-actin rings. Inhibition of NM-II activity with blebbistatin significantly increases axon diameter without affecting the periodicity of either the F-actin rings or NM-II. This sustained radial expansion significantly affects the trafficking speed, directionality, and reduces the overall efficiency of long-range retrograde axonal cargoes, eventually leading to focal axon swelling and cargo accumulation, which are hallmarks of axonal degeneration.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Novel Alzheimer risk genes determine the microglia response to amyloid-β but not to TAU pathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/491902v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/491902v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Thousands of SNPs associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) do not reach genome-wide significance. When combined, they contribute however to a highly predictive polygenic risk score. The relevance of these subthreshold risk genes to disease, and how their combined predictive power translates into functionally relevant disease pathways, is unknown. We investigate here at the genome-wide level and in an unbiased way to what extent AD risk genes show altered gene expression in the context of increasing amyloid-{beta} or Tau pathology in mouse models of AD. Methods: We used an existing GWAS data set to generate lists of candidate AD genes at different levels of significance. We performed transcriptomic analysis on wild-type and transgenic APP/PS1 (APPtg) and Thy-TAU22 (TAUtg) mouse models at early and late stage of disease. We used unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify clusters of co-regulated genes responsive to amyloid-{beta} or TAU pathology. Gene set enrichment was used to identify clusters that were enriched for AD risk genes. Findings: Consistent and significant enrichment of AD risk genes was found in only one out of 63 co-expression modules. This module is highly responsive to amyloid-{beta} but not to TAU pathology. We identify in this module 18 AD risk genes (p-value=6.5e-11) including 11 new ones, GPC2, TREML2, SYK, GRN, SLC2A5, SAMSN1, PYDC1, HEXB, RRBP1, LYN and BLNK. All are expressed in microglia, have a binding site for the transcription factor SPI1 (PU.1), and become significantly upregulated when exposed to amyloid-{beta}. A subset regulates FC-gamma receptor mediated phagocytosis. Interpretation: Genetic risk of AD is functionally translated into a microglia pathway responsive to amyloid-{beta} pathology. This insight integrates aspects of the amyloid hypothesis with genetic risk associated to sporadic AD.</description>

Kynurenines, the products of tryptophan oxidative degradation, are involved in multiple neuropathologies, such as Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, senile dementia, etc. The major cause for hydroxykynurenines's neurotoxicity is the oxidative stress induced by the reactive oxygen species (ROS), the by-products of L-3-hydroxykynurenine (L-3HOK) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) oxidative self-dimerization. 2-aminophenol (2AP), a structural precursor of L-3HOK and 3HAA, undergoes the oxidative conjugation to form 2-aminophenoxazinone. There are several modes of 2AP dimerization, including both enzymatic and non-enzymatic stages. In this study, the free energies for 2AP, L-3HOK and 3HAA dimerization stages have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)//6-311+(O)+G(d) level, both in the gas phase and in heptane or water solution. For the intermediates, ionization potentials and electron affinities were calculated, as well as free energy and kinetics of molecular oxygen interaction with several non-enzymatically formed dimers. H-atom donating power of the intermediates increases upon the progress of the oxidation, making possible generation of hydroperoxyl radical or hydrogen peroxide from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the last stages. Among the dimerization intermediates, 2-aminophenoxazinole derivatives have the lowest ionization potential and can reduce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to superoxide anion. The rate for O-H homolytic bond dissociation is significantly higher than that for C-H bond in non-enzymatic quinoneimine conjugate. However, the last reaction passes irreversibly, reducing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to hydroperoxyl radical. The inorganic ferrous iron and the heme group of Drosophila phenoxazinone synthase significantly reduce the energy cost of 2AP H-atom abstraction by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We have also shown experimentally that total antioxidant capacity decreases in Drosophila mutant &lt;i&gt;cardinal&lt;/i&gt; with L-3HOK excess relative to the wild type &lt;i&gt;Canton-S&lt;/i&gt;, and lipid peroxidation decreases in aged &lt;i&gt;cardinal&lt;/i&gt;. Taken together, our data supports the conception of hydroxykynurenines' dual role in neurotoxicity: serving as antioxidants themselves, blocking lipid peroxidation by H-atom donation, they also can easily generate ROS upon dimerization, leading to the oxidative stress development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C-7ALSyceJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a technique applicable in any dynamical framework to identify control-robust subsets of an interacting system. These robust subsystems, which we call stable modules, are characterized by constraints on the variables that make up the subsystem. They are robust in the sense that if the defining constraints are satisfied at a given time, they remain satisfied for all later times, regardless of what happens in the rest of the system, and can only be broken if the constrained variables are externally manipulated. We identify stable modules as graph structures in an &lt;i&gt;expanded network&lt;/i&gt;, which represents causal links between variable constraints. A stable module represents a system “decision point”, or trap subspace. Using the expanded network, small stable modules can be composed sequentially to form larger stable modules that describe dynamics on the system level. Collections of large, mutually exclusive stable modules describe the system’s repertoire of long-term behaviors. We implement this technique in a broad class of dynamical systems and illustrate its practical utility via examples and algorithmic analysis of two published biological network models. In the segment polarity gene network of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, we obtain a state-space visualization that reproduces by novel means the four possible cell fates and predicts the outcome of cell transplant experiments. In the T-cell signaling network, we identify six signaling elements that determine the high-signal response and show that control of an element connected to them cannot disrupt this response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WHPTZKaeRs0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Coherency of circadian rhythms in the SCN is governed by the interplay of two coupling factors</title>

Circadian clocks are autonomous oscillators driving daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In mammals, a network of coupled neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained to environmental light-dark cycles and orchestrates the timing of peripheral organs. In each neuron, transcriptional feedbacks generate noisy oscillations. Coupling mediated by neuropeptides such as VIP and AVP lends precision and robustness to circadian rhythms. The detailed coupling mechanisms between SCN neurons are debated. We analyze organotypic SCN slices from neonatal and adult mice in wild-type and multiple knockout conditions. Different degrees of rhythmicity are quantified by pixel-level analysis of bioluminescence data. We use empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to characterize spatio-temporal patterns. Simulations of coupled stochastic single cell oscillators can reproduce the diversity of observed patterns. Our combination of data analysis and modeling provides deeper insight into the enormous complexity of the data: (1) Neonatal slices are typically stronger oscillators than adult slices pointing to developmental changes of coupling. (2) Wild-type slices are completely synchronized and exhibit specific spatio-temporal patterns of phases. (3) Some slices of Cry double knockouts obey impaired synchrony that can lead to co–existing rhythms (“splitting”). (4) The loss of VIP-coupling leads to desynchronized rhythms with few residual local clusters. Additional information was extracted from co–culturing slices with rhythmic neonatal wild-type SCNs. These co–culturing experiments were simulated using external forcing terms representing VIP and AVP signaling. The rescue of rhythmicity via co–culturing lead to surprising results, since a cocktail of AVP-antagonists improved synchrony. Our modeling suggests that these counter-intuitive observations are pointing to an antagonistic action of VIP and AVP coupling.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Odorant mixtures elicit less variable and faster responses than pure odorants</title>

In natural environments, odors are typically mixtures of several different chemical compounds. However, the implications of mixtures for odor processing have not been fully investigated. We have extended a standard olfactory receptor model to mixtures and found through its mathematical analysis that odorant-evoked activity patterns are more stable across concentrations and first-spike latencies of receptor neurons are shorter for mixtures than for pure odorants. Shorter first-spike latencies arise from the nonlinear dependence of binding rate on odorant concentration, commonly described by the Hill coefficient, while the more stable activity patterns result from the competition between different ligands for receptor sites. These results are consistent with observations from numerical simulations and physiological recordings in the olfactory system of insects. Our results suggest that mixtures allow faster and more reliable olfactory coding, which could be one of the reasons why animals often use mixtures in chemical signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uT4ayB9vUj8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme Borreliosis is the object of numerous misconceptions. In this review, we revisit the fundamental manifestations of neuroborreliosis (meningitis and cranial and radiculoneuritis) as these have withstood the test of time. We also discuss other manifestations that are less frequent. Stroke, as a manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis, is considered in the context of other infections. The summary of the literature regarding clinical outcomes of neuroborreliosis leads to its controversies. We also include new information on pathogenesis, and on the polymicrobial nature of tick‐borne diseases. In this way, we update the review that we wrote in this journal in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Trade-off between sensitivity and selectivity in systems with convergence. (arXiv:1812.03122v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was observed before that in neuronal systems with convergence, a possible
amplification can be as large as the degree of convergence. This is in the case
when a single impulse from the converging inputs is enough to trigger the
secondary neuron. On the other hand, if a number of impulses are required for
triggering, a gain in discriminating ability may be obtained along with
decrease in sensitivity. We discuss this trade-off in terms of concrete
estimates using olfactory sensory neuron and the set of its receptor proteins
as an example of system with convergence.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Role of Engagement, Honing, and Mindfulness in Creativity. (arXiv:1812.02870v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As both our external world and inner worlds become more complex, we are faced
with more novel challenges, hardships, and duress. Creative thinking is needed
to provide fresh perspectives and solve new problems.Because creativity can be
conducive to accessing and reliving traumatic memories, emotional scars may be
exacerbated by creative practices before these are transformed and released.
Therefore, in preparing our youth to thrive in an increasingly unpredictable
world, it could be helpful to cultivate in them an understanding of the
creative process and its relationship to hardship, as well as tools and
techniques for fostering not just creativity but self-awareness and
mindfulness. This chapter is a review of theories of creativity through the
lens of their capacity to account for the relationship between creativity and
hardship, as well as the therapeutic effects of creativity. We also review
theories and research on aspects of mindfulness attending to potential
therapeutic effects of creativity. Drawing upon the creativity and mindfulness
literatures, we sketch out what an introductory 'creativity and mindfulness'
module might look like as part of an educational curriculum designed to address
the unique challenges of the 21st Century.

	<description>Stimulated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M2Rs) release Gβγ subunits, which slow heart rate by activating a G protein-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (GIRK). Stimulated β2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) also release Gβγ subunits, but GIRK is not activated. This study addresses the mechanism underlying this specificity of GIRK activation by M2Rs. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between labelled G proteins and GIRK show that M2Rs catalyze Gβγ subunit release at higher rates than β2ARs, generating higher Gβγ concentrations that activate GIRK and regulate other targets of Gβγ. The higher rate of Gβγ release is attributable to a faster G protein coupled receptor - G protein trimer association rate in M2R compared to β2AR. Thus, a rate difference in a single kinetic step accounts for specificity.</description>

	<description>Bacterial and eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases (RNAPs) cap RNA with the oxidized and reduced forms of the metabolic effector nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH, using NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH as non‑canonical initiating nucleotides for transcription initiation. Here, we show that mitochondrial RNAPs (mtRNAPs) cap RNA with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH, and do so more efficiently than nuclear RNAPs. Direct quantitation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- and NADH-capped RNA demonstrates remarkably high levels of capping&lt;i&gt; in vivo&lt;/i&gt;: up to ~60% NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH capping of yeast mitochondrial transcripts, and up to ~15% NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; capping of human mitochondrial transcripts. The capping efficiency is determined by promoter sequence at, and upstream of, the transcription start site and, in yeast and human cells, by intracellular NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH levels. Our findings indicate mtRNAPs serve as both sensors and actuators in coupling cellular metabolism to mitochondrial transcriptional outputs, sensing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH levels and adjusting transcriptional outputs accordingly.</description>

	<description>INAD assembles key enzymes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; compound eye photo-transduction pathway into a supramolecular complex, supporting efficient and fast light signaling. However, the molecular mechanism governing the interaction between INAD and NORPA (phospholipase Cβ, PLCβ), a key step for the fast kinetics of the light signaling, is not known. Here, we show that the NORPA C-terminal coiled-coil domain and PDZ-binding motif (CC-PBM) synergistically bind to INAD PDZ45 tandem with an unexpected mode and unprecedentedly high affinity. Guided by the INAD/NORPA complex structure, we discover that INADL is likely a mammalian counterpart of INAD. The INADL PDZ89 tandem specifically binds to PLCβ4 with a strikingly similar mode to that of the INAD/NORPA complex as revealed by the structure of the INADL PDZ89/PLCβ4 CC-PBM complex. Therefore, our study suggests that the highly specific PDZ tandem/PLCβ interactions are an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in PLCβ signaling of the animal kingdom.</description>

	<description>Working memory deficits are present in many neuropsychiatric diseases with diagnosis-related severity. However, it is unknown whether this common behavioral abnormality is a continuum explained by a neural mechanism shared across diseases or a set of discrete dysfunctions. Here, we performed predictive modeling to examine working memory ability (WMA) as a function of normative whole-brain connectivity across psychiatric diseases. We built a quantitative model for letter 3-back task performance in healthy participants, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). This normative model was applied to independent participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 965) including four psychiatric diagnoses. Individual's predicted WMA significantly correlated with a measured WMA in both healthy population and schizophrenia. Our predicted effect size estimates on WMA impairment were comparable to previous meta-analysis results. These results suggest a general association between brain connectivity and working memory ability applicable commonly to health and psychiatric diseases.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A repressor-decay timer for robust temporal patterning in embryonic Drosophila neuroblast lineages</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38631</link>
	<description>Biological timers synchronize patterning processes during embryonic development. In the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo, neural progenitors (neuroblasts; NBs) produce a sequence of unique neurons whose identities depend on the sequential expression of temporal transcription factors (TTFs). The stereotypy and precision of NB lineages indicate reproducible TTF timer progression. We combine theory and experiments to define the timer mechanism. The TTF timer is commonly described as a relay of activators, but its regulatory circuit is also consistent with a repressor-decay timer, where TTF expression begins when its repressor decays. Theory shows that repressor-decay timers are more robust to parameter variations than activator-relay timers. This motivated us to experimentally compare the relative importance of the relay and decay interactions &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Comparing WT and mutant NBs at high temporal resolution, we show that the TTF sequence progresses primarily by repressor-decay. We suggest that need for robust performance shapes the evolutionary-selected designs of biological circuits.</description>

	<description>Flying animals need continual sensory feedback about their body position and orientation for flight control. The visual system provides essential but slow feedback. In contrast, mechanosensory channels can provide feedback at much shorter timescales. How the contributions from these two senses are integrated remains an open question in most insect groups. In Diptera, fast mechanosensory feedback is provided by organs called halteres, and is crucial for the control of rapid flight manoeuvres, while vision controls manoeuvres in lower temporal frequency bands. Here we have investigated the visual-mechanosensory integration in the hawkmoth &lt;i&gt;Macroglossum stellatarum.&lt;/i&gt; They represent a large group of insects that use Johnston's organs in their antennae to provide mechanosensory feedback on perturbations in body position. Our experiments show that antennal mechanosensory feedback specifically mediates fast flight manoeuvres, but not slow ones. Moreover, we did not observe compensatory interactions between antennal and visual feedback.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortical and thalamic connectivity of temporal visual cortical areas 20a and 20b of the domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo).</title>

	<description>The present study describes the ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic connectivity of the temporal visual areas 20a and 20b in the ferret using standard anatomical tract-tracing methods. The two temporal visual areas are strongly interconnected, but area 20a is primarily connected to the occipital visual areas, whereas area 20b maintains more widespread connections with the occipital, parietal and suprasylvian visual areas and the secondary auditory cortex. The callosal connectivity, although homotopic, consists mainly of very weak anterograde labelling which was more widespread in area 20a than area 20b. Although areas 20a and 20b are well connected with the visual dorsal thalamus, the injection into area 20a resulted in more anterograde label, whereas more retrograde label was observed in the visual thalamus following the injection into area 20b. Most interestingly, comparisons to previous connectional studies of cat areas 20a and 20b reveal a common pattern of connectivity of the temporal visual cortex in carnivores, where the posterior parietal cortex and the central temporal region (PMLS) provide network points required for dorsal and ventral stream interaction enroute to integration in the prefrontal cortex. This pattern of network connectivity is not dissimilar to that observed in primates, which highlights the ferret as a useful animal model to understand visual sensory integration between the dorsal and ventral streams. This data will contribute to the Ferretome (www.ferretome.org) to facilitate cross species analysis of brain connectomes and wiring principles of the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stytra: an open-source, integrated system for stimulation, tracking and closed-loop behavioral experiments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492553v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492553v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We present Stytra, a flexible, open-source software package, written in Python, that we designed to cover all the general requirements involved in larval zebrafish behavioral experiments. It allows timed stimulus presentation, interfacing with external devices and simultaneous real-time tracking of position, tail and eye motion in both freely-swimming and head-restrained preparations. It logs in standardized formats all recorded quantities, metadata, and code version to allow full provenance tracking, from data acquisition through analysis to publication. The package is modular and expandable for different experimental protocols and setups. Current releases can be found at https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra. We also provide complete documentation with examples for extending the package to new stimuli and hardware, as well as a schema and parts list for behavioral setups. We showcase Stytra by reproducing two previously behavioral protocols, one with head-restrained and the other with freely-swimming larvae, as well as an experiment in which the software is used in the context of a calcium imaging experiment, where it can trigger and communicate with other acquisition devices. Our aims are to help laboratories with little or no experience in the field to start implementing behavioral experiments and to provide a platform for sharing stimulus protocols to enable easy reproduction of experiments and straightforward validation. In addition, Stytra can easily serve as a base platform to design behavioral experiments in other model organisms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Invariant neural responses for sensory categories revealed by the time-varying information for communication calls</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492546v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Although information theoretic approaches have been used extensively in the analysis of the neural code, they have yet to be used to describe how information is accumulated in time while sensory systems are categorizing dynamic sensory stimuli such as speech sounds or visual objects. Here, we present a novel method to estimate the cumulative information for stimuli or categories. We further define a time-varying categorical information index that, by comparing the information obtained for stimuli versus categories of these same stimuli, quantifies invariant neural representations. We use these methods to investigate the dynamic properties of avian cortical auditory neurons recorded in zebra finches that were listening to a large set of call stimuli sampled from the complete vocal repertoire of this species. We found that the time-varying rates carry 5 times more information than the mean firing rates even in the first 100 ms. We also found that cumulative information has slow time constants (100-600 ms) relative to the typical integration time of single neurons, reflecting the fact that the behaviorally informative features of auditory objects are time-varying sound patterns. When we correlated firing rates and information values, we found that average information correlates with average firing rate but that higher-rates found at the onset response yielded similar information values as the lower-rates found in the sustained response: the onset and sustained response of avian cortical auditory neurons provide similar levels of independent information about call identity and call type. Finally, our information measures allowed us to rigorously define categorical neurons; these categorical neurons show a high degree of invariance for vocalizations within a call-type. Surprisingly, call-type invariant neurons were found in both primary and secondary avian auditory areas.</description>

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive measure of brain electrical activity. Neural population models, where large numbers of interacting neurons are considered collectively as a macroscopic system, have long been used to understand features in EEG signals. By tuning dozens of input parameters describing the excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, these models can reproduce prominent features of the EEG such as the alpha-rhythm. However, the inverse problem, of directly estimating the parameters from fits to EEG data, remains unsolved. Solving this multi-parameter non-linear fitting problem will potentially provide a real-time method for characterizing average neuronal properties in human subjects. Here we perform unbiased fits of a 22-parameter neural population model to EEG data from 82 individuals, using both particle swarm optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We estimate how much is learned about individual parameters by computing Kullback-Leibler divergences between posterior and prior distributions for each parameter. Results indicate that only a single parameter, that determining the dynamics of inhibition, is directly identifiable, while other parameters have large, though correlated, uncertainties. We show that the eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix are roughly uniformly spaced over a log scale, indicating that the model is sloppy, like many of the regulatory network models in systems biology. These eigenvalues indicate that the system can be modeled with a low effective dimensionality, with inhibition being prominent in driving system behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Correlations between holistic processing, Autism quotient, extraversion, and experience and the own-gender bias in face recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492322v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492322v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The variability in the own-gender bias (OGB) in face-recognition is thought to be based on experience (Herlitz &amp;amp; Loven, 2013) and the engagement of expert face processing mechanisms for own-gender faces. Experience is also associated with personality characteristics such as extraversion and Autism, yet the effects of these variables on the own-gender bias has not been explored. We ran a face recognition study exploring the relationships between opposite-gender experience, holistic processing (measured using the face-inversion effect, composite face effect, and the parts-and-wholes test), personality characteristics (extraversion and Autism Quotient) and the OGB. Findings did not support a mediational account where experience increases holistic processing and this increases the OGB. Rather, there was a direct relationship between extraversion and Autism Quotient and the OGB. We interpret this as personality characteristics having an effect on the motivation to process own-gender faces more deeply than opposite-gender faces.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: From: Benjamin LemassonParametric response mapping as a new MRI approach for the characterization of posttraumatic cerebral edema</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/492298v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Purpose Cerebral edema is usually assessed with mean ADC value obtained with MRI. We aimed to use parametric response mapping (PRM), a voxel-based analysis, in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to characterize the cerebral edema and to compare findings to those obtained with the classical global mean ADC analysis. Ultimately we wished to test whether early PRM analysis could identify the vasogenic or cellular edematous pattern two hours after trauma. Materials and Methods Experiments were conducted in a rat model of TBI in accordance with French Government guidelines. Eighteen traumatic brain-injured rats (TBI group) were compared to 7 sham-operated rats (Sham group). Diffusion-weighted images were acquired before and immediately (H0), 60min (H1) and 120min (H2) after the trauma. Two regions of interest (ROI) including cortex (cortical-ROI) and the whole brain (brainROI) were manually delineated. Results Averaged ADC value in cortical-ROI was significantly reduced at H2 in the TBI group versus Sham group (715{+/-}24 vs 781{+/-}16 {micro}m{superscript 2}/sec; p=0.04), not in brain-ROI (748{+/-}27 vs 801{+/-}18 {micro}m{superscript 2}/sec; p=0.32). By contrast, PRM values were significantly changed in these two ROIs at as soon as H1 in the TBI group (27.5{+/-}4% of the voxels beyond the PRM threshold in TBI group vs 5.1{+/-}1% in sham group; p&amp;lt;0.01). PRM was able to identify the nature of post traumatic cerebral edema: vasogenic, cellular or mixed pattern. ADC data obtained immediately after TBI and analyzed using PRM correlated with ADC data obtained at H2. Conclusion The PRM approach is more sensitive than averaged ADC at detecting and identifying post-traumatic brain edema. It is able to PRM might be a promising tool to individualize the management of patients with posttraumatic brain edema.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Targeting the CaV -  interaction yields a selective antagonist of the N-type CaV2.2 channel with broad antinociceptive efficacy</title>

	<description>Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels is a potential therapy for many neurological diseases including chronic pain. Neuronal CaV1/CaV2 channels are composed of , {beta} and 2{delta} subunits. The {beta}-subunits of CaV channels are cytoplasmic proteins that increase the surface expression of the pore-forming α subunit of CaV. We targeted the high-affinity protein-protein interface of CaV{beta} pocket within the CaV-subunit. Structure-based virtual screening of 50,000 small molecule library docked to the {beta}-subunit led to the identification of 2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-N-((4-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)quinazolin-2-yl)methyl)acetamide (compound 45). This small molecule bound to CaV{beta} and inhibited its coupling with N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV2.2) channels, leading to a reduction in CaV2.2 currents in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, decreased pre-synaptic localization of CaV2.2 in vivo, decreased frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic potentials (sEPSC), and inhibited release of the nociceptive neurotransmitter calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) from spinal cord. 45 was antinociceptive in naive animals and reversed allodynia and hyperalgesia in models of acute (post-surgical) and neuropathic (spinal nerve ligation, chemotherapy- and gp120- induced peripheral neuropathy, and genome-edited neuropathy) pain. 45 did not cause akinesia or motor impairment, a common adverse effect of CaV2.2 targeting drugs, when injected into the brain. 45, a quinazoline analog, represents a novel class of CaV2.2-targeting compounds that may serve as probes to interrogate CaV-{beta} function and ultimately be developed as a non-opioid therapeutic for chronic pain.</description>

	<description>We investigated afferent inputs from all areas in the frontal cortex (FC) to different subregions in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Using retrograde tracing in macaque monkeys, we quantified projection strength by counting retrogradely labeled cells in each FC area. The projection from different FC regions varied across injection sites in strength, following different spatial patterns. Importantly, a site at the rostral end of the cingulate sulcus stood out as having strong inputs from many areas in diverse FC regions. Moreover, it was at the integrative conjunction of three projection trends across sites. This site marks a connectional hub inside the rACC that integrates FC inputs across functional modalities. Tractography with monkey diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) located a similar hub region comparable to the tracing result. Applying the same tractography method to human dMRI data, we demonstrated that a similar hub can be located in the human rACC.</description>

	<description>Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is a widespread method utilized for estimating brain-wide functional connectivity (FC) in health and disease. However, the cellular underpinnings of aberrant FC detected in numerous neuropsychiatric conditions in humans and animal models remain unknown. Here we altered the neural dynamics within cortical microcircuits such that excitation:inhibition (E:I) ratio increases and tested whether this manipulation causes abnormal FC at the macroscopic level. Using a mouse model, we combined functional magnetic resonance at the resting state (rsfMRI) with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to (i) locally increase excitation using hM3Dq-DREADDs, or (ii) locally suppress activity of inhibitory Parvalbumin interneurons with hM4Di-DREADDs in the somatosensory network. Irrespective of which pathway was used to increase the E:I ratio, activating the DREADDs significantly increased neuronal firing and relative blood flow around the injection site and caused a rapid and long-lasting reduction in local and long-range FC. We further show that both DREADD manipulations change the BOLD dynamics of the injection site in a similar manner suggesting that an increase of E:I converges on a common BOLD timeseries signature. Our approach represents the first steps towards identifying a causal link between E:I at the cellular-population level and brain-wide, macroscopic functional connectivity, the latter being an important marker of neurodevelopmental disorders which translates across species.</description>

	<description>The regulated excretion of CO2 during breathing is a key life-preserving homeostatic mechanism. In the rostral medulla oblongata, neurons in two nuclei - the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and the rostral medullary raphe - have been proposed as central CO2 chemosensors that mediate adaptive changes in breathing. Using synapsin promoter-driven expression of GCaMP6 and head-mounted mini-microscopes, we imaged the Ca2+ activity of RTN and raphe neurons in awake adult mice during inspiration of elevated CO2. 40% of raphe neurons were activated by 3% and 6% inspired CO2. By contrast, only 5% of RTN neurons were activated by CO2. 4% of RTN neurons were inhibited by elevated CO2, and 4% of RTN neurons were coactive with exploratory sniffing. In awake mice it is therefore the serotonergic raphe neurons that are predominant in detecting and mediating the effects of elevated inspired CO2. Neurons of the RTN have heterogeneous roles but make relatively little contribution to this key homeostatic reflex.</description>

	<description>Sensory stimuli have extensive correlations, which should be exploited by an efficient detector of specific sensory features according to theoretical principles. Here we show that visual stimulation far outside the classical receptive field center causes ganglion cells to subsequently increase their sensitivity to local stimuli in a process we term long-range sensitization. This increased sensitivity improves detection and discrimination of weak stimuli and exhibits pattern specificity, increasing sensitivity more when peripheral and central stimuli share spatial frequency statistics. This process requires input from wide-field, nonlinear inhibitory amacrine cells, supporting a simple circuit model that reproduces sensitization. We further show that long-range sensitization parallels a novel perceptual effect in humans, in which surround stimulation subsequently improves discrimination of a small central stimulus. We conclude that the retina uses long-range statistics of the visual world to better encode local visual features, and that such improved encoding may play a role in perception.</description>

	<description>Our ability to maintain a coherent bodily self despite continuous changes within and outside our body relies on the highly flexible multisensory representation of the body, and of the space surrounding it: the peripersonal space (PPS). The aim of our study was to investigate whether during pregnancy - when extremely rapid changes in body size and shape occur - a likewise rapid plastic reorganization of the neural representation of the PPS occurs. We used an audio-tactile integration task to measure the PPS boundary at different stages of pregnancy. We found that in the second trimester of pregnancy and postpartum women did not show differences in their PPS size as compared to the control group (non-pregnant women). However, in the third trimester the PPS was larger than the controls' PPS and the shift between representation of near and far space was more gradual. We therefore conclude that during pregnancy the brain adapts to the sudden bodily changes, by expanding the representation of the space around the body. This may represent a mechanism to protect the vulnerable abdomen from injury from surrounding objects.</description>

An expanded chemical space is essential for improved identification of small molecules for emerging therapeutic targets. However, the identification of targets for novel compounds is biased towards the synthesis of known scaffolds that bind familiar protein families, limiting the exploration of chemical space. To change this paradigm, we validated a new pipeline that identifies small molecule-protein interactions and works even for compounds lacking similarity to known drugs. Based on differential mRNA profiles in multiple cell types exposed to drugs and in which gene knockdowns (KD) were conducted, we showed that drugs induce gene regulatory networks that correlate with those produced after silencing protein-coding genes. Next, we applied supervised machine learning to exploit drug-KD signature correlations and enriched our predictions using an orthogonal structure-based screen. As a proof-of-principle for this regimen, top-10/top-100 target prediction accuracies of 26% and 41%, respectively, were achieved on a validation set 152 FDA-approved drugs and 3104 potential targets. We then predicted targets for 1680 compounds and validated chemical interactors with four targets that have proven difficult to chemically modulate, including non-covalent inhibitors of HRAS and KRAS. Importantly, drug-target interactions manifest as gene expression correlations between drug treatment and both target gene KD and KD of genes that act up- or down-stream of the target, even for relatively weak binders. These correlations provide new insights on the cellular response of disrupting protein interactions and highlight the complex genetic phenotypes of drug treatment. With further refinement, our pipeline may accelerate the identification and development of novel chemical classes by screening compound-target interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wg-vTH0iouw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The modeling of large-scale communicable epidemics has greatly benefited in the last years from the increasing availability of highly detailed data. Particullarly, in order to achieve quantitative descriptions of the evolution of epidemics, contact networks and mixing patterns are key. These heterogeneous patterns depend on several factors such as location, socioeconomic conditions, time, and age. This last factor has been shown to encapsulate a large fraction of the observed inter-individual variation in contact patterns, an observation validated by different measurements of age-dependent contact matrices. Recently, several works have studied how to project those matrices to areas where empirical data are not available. However, the dependence of contact matrices on demographic structures and their time evolution has been largely neglected. In this work, we tackle the problem of how to transform an empirical contact matrix that has been obtained for a given demographic structure into a different contact matrix that is compatible with a different demography. The methodology discussed here allows to extrapolate a contact structure measured in a particular area to any other whose demographic structure is known, as well as to obtain the time evolution of contact matrices as a function of the demographic dynamics of the populations they refer to. To quantify the effect of considering time-dynamics of contact patterns on disease modeling, we implemented a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model on 16 different countries and regions and evaluated the impact of neglecting the temporal evolution of mixing patterns. Our results show that simulated disease incidence rates, both at the aggregated and age-specific levels, are significantly dependent on contact structures variation driven by demographic evolution. The present work opens the path to eliminate technical biases from model-based impact evaluations of future epidemic threats and warns against the use of contact matrices to model diseases without correcting for demographic evolution or geographic variations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AwHi76UpiTA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Failure to demonstrate efficacy and safety issues are important reasons that drugs do not reach the market. An incomplete understanding of how drugs exert their effects hinders regulatory and pharmaceutical industry projections of a drug’s benefits and risks. Signaling pathways mediate drug response and while many signaling molecules have been characterized for their contribution to disease or their role in drug side effects, our knowledge of these pathways is incomplete. To better understand all signaling molecules involved in drug response and the phenotype associations of these molecules, we created a novel method, PathFX, a non-commercial entity, to identify these pathways and drug-related phenotypes. We benchmarked PathFX by identifying drugs’ marketed disease indications and reported a sensitivity of 41%, a 2.7-fold improvement over similar approaches. We then used PathFX to strengthen signals for drug-adverse event pairs occurring in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and also identified opportunities for drug repurposing for new diseases based on interaction paths that associated a marketed drug to that disease. By discovering molecular interaction pathways, PathFX improved our understanding of drug associations to safety and efficacy phenotypes. The algorithm may provide a new means to improve regulatory and therapeutic development decisions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LxTEafI_y3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deep convolutional networks do not classify based on global object shape</title>

Deep convolutional networks (DCNNs) are achieving previously unseen performance in object classification, raising questions about whether DCNNs operate similarly to human vision. In biological vision, shape is arguably the most important cue for recognition. We tested the role of shape information in DCNNs trained to recognize objects. In Experiment 1, we presented a trained DCNN with object silhouettes that preserved overall shape but were filled with surface texture taken from other objects. Shape cues appeared to play some role in the classification of artifacts, but little or none for animals. In Experiments 2–4, DCNNs showed no ability to classify glass figurines or outlines but correctly classified some silhouettes. Aspects of these results led us to hypothesize that DCNNs do not distinguish object’s bounding contours from other edges, and that DCNNs access some local shape features, but not global shape. In Experiment 5, we tested this hypothesis with displays that preserved local features but disrupted global shape, and vice versa. With disrupted global shape, which reduced human accuracy to 28%, DCNNs gave the same classification labels as with ordinary shapes. Conversely, local contour changes eliminated accurate DCNN classification but caused no difficulty for human observers. These results provide evidence that DCNNs have access to some local shape information in the form of local edge relations, but they have no access to global object shapes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EWN-4NvdjRQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-scale computational study of the Warburg effect, reverse Warburg effect and glutamine addiction in solid tumors</title>

Cancer metabolism has received renewed interest as a potential target for cancer therapy. In this study, we use a multi-scale modeling approach to interrogate the implications of three metabolic scenarios of potential clinical relevance: the Warburg effect, the reverse Warburg effect and glutamine addiction. At the intracellular level, we construct a network of central metabolism and perform flux balance analysis (FBA) to estimate metabolic fluxes; at the cellular level, we exploit this metabolic network to calculate parameters for a coarse-grained description of cellular growth kinetics; and at the multicellular level, we incorporate these kinetic schemes into the cellular automata of an agent-based model (ABM), iDynoMiCS. This ABM evaluates the reaction-diffusion of the metabolites, cellular division and motion over a simulation domain. Our multi-scale simulations suggest that the Warburg effect provides a growth advantage to the tumor cells under resource limitation. However, we identify a non-monotonic dependence of growth rate on the strength of glycolytic pathway. On the other hand, the reverse Warburg scenario provides an initial growth advantage in tumors that originate deeper in the tissue. The metabolic profile of stromal cells considered in this scenario allows more oxygen to reach the tumor cells in the deeper tissue and thus promotes tumor growth at earlier stages. Lastly, we suggest that glutamine addiction does not confer a selective advantage to tumor growth with glutamine acting as a carbon source in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, any advantage of glutamine uptake must come through other pathways not included in our model (e.g., as a nitrogen donor). Our analysis illustrates the importance of accounting explicitly for spatial and temporal evolution of tumor microenvironment in the interpretation of metabolic scenarios and hence provides a basis for further studies, including evaluation of specific therapeutic strategies that target metabolism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jHyBoRBbB-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

About 330 CNS cells comprise mostly ciliated ependymal cells, with ∼180 neurons that constitute about 50 morphologically distinguishable types. The neurons reveal various chordate characters amid many features that are idiosyncratic. Most neurons are ciliated and lack dendrites, some even lack an axon. Synapses mostly form en passant between axons, and resemble those in basal invertebrates; some are dyads and all have heterogenous synaptic vesicle populations. Each neuron has on average 49 synapses with other cells; these constitute a synaptic network of unpredicted complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Gershman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancing exploration and exploitation is one of the central problems in reinforcement learning. We review recent studies that have identified multiple algorithmic strategies underlying exploration. In particular, humans use a combination of random and uncertainty-directed exploration strategies, which rely on different brain systems, have different developmental trajectories, and are sensitive to different task manipulations. Humans are also able to exploit sophisticated structural knowledge to aid their exploration, such as information about correlations between options. New computational models, drawing inspiration from machine learning, have begun to formalize these ideas and offer new ways to understand the neural basis of reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Despite impressive recent progress, including single cell transcriptome and epigenome profiling as well as anatomical methods, we still lack a complete census or taxonomy of brain cell types. We argue this is due partly to the conceptual difficulty in defining a cell type. By considering the biological drivers of cell identity, such as networks of genes and gene regulatory elements, we propose a definition of cell type that emphasizes self-stabilizing regulation. We explore the predictions and hypotheses that arise from this definition. Integration of data from multiple modalities, including molecular profiling of genes and gene products, epigenetic landscape, cellular morphology, connectivity, and physiology, will be essential for a meaningful and broadly useful definition of brain cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrophysiological correlates of absolute pitch in a passive auditory oddball paradigm: a direct replication attempt</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Humans with absolute pitch (AP) are able to effortlessly name the pitch class of a sound without an external reference. The association of labels with pitches cannot be entirely suppressed even if it interferes with task demands. This suggests a high level of automaticity of pitch labeling in AP. The automatic nature of AP was further investigated in a study by Rogenmoser et al. (2015). Using a passive auditory oddball paradigm in combination with electroencephalography, they observed electrophysiological differences between musicians with and without AP in response to piano tones. Specifically, the AP musicians showed a smaller P3a, an event-related potential (ERP) component presumably reflecting early attentional processes. In contrast, they did not find group differences in the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component associated with auditory memory processes. They concluded that early cognitive processes are facilitated in AP during passive listening and are more important for AP than the preceding sensory processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our direct replication study on a larger sample of musicians with (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54, 27 females, 27 males) and without (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 50, 24 females, 26 males) AP, we successfully replicated the non-significant effects of AP on the MMN. However, we could not replicate the significant effects for the P3a. Additional Bayes factor analyses revealed moderate to strong evidence (Bayes factor &amp;gt; 3) for the null hypothesis for both MMN and P3a. Therefore, the results of this replication study do not support the postulated importance of cognitive facilitation in AP during passive tone listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A better understanding of the neural basis of absolute pitch (AP), the ability to identify a pitch without an external reference, provides valuable insights to the mechanisms of pitch processing in the human brain. Since only a tiny fraction of the population possesses AP, most previous neuroscientific research had small sample sizes. In our direct replication, we used a large sample of musicians (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 104) with and without AP to confirm an intriguing finding showing that AP musicians process tones more efficiently even when not actively attending them. Using both frequentist and Bayesian analyses, we failed to replicate this effect with an identical experimental setting. This finding highlights the significance of replications and the need for large sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Mixed-Lineage Kinase Inhibitor URMC-099 Protects Hippocampal Synapses in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Long-Term Potentiation and Excitability in the Hippocampus Are Modulated Differently by {theta} Rhythm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in the brain facilitate neural processing and cognitive functions. This study investigated the dependence of long-term potentiation (LTP), a neural correlate of memory, on the phase of the hippocampal  rhythm, a prominent brain oscillation. Multichannel field potentials and current source-sinks were analyzed in hippocampal CA1 of adult male rats under urethane anesthesia. A single burst (five pulses at 200 Hz) stimulation of stratum oriens (OR) induced LTP of the basal dendritic excitatory sink (ES), which was maximal when the burst was delivered at ~340° and ~160° of the distal dendritic  rhythm. Apical dendritic sink evoked by stratum radiatum (RAD) stimulation also showed biphasic maxima at ~30° and ~210° of the distal dendritic  rhythm, about 50° phase delay to basal dendritic LTP. By contrast, maximal population spike (PS) excitability, following single-pulse excitation of the basal or mid-apical dendrites, occurred at a  phase of ~140°, and maximal basal dendritic ES occurred at ~20°;  (30–57 Hz) activity recorded in CA1 RAD had maximal power at ~300° of the distal dendritic  rhythm, different from the phases of maximal LTP. LTP induced during the rising  phase was NMDA receptor sensitive. It is suggested that the  phase modulation of CA1 PS excitability is mainly provided by -rhythmic proximal inhibition, while dendritic LTP is also modulated by dendritic inhibition and excitation, specific to basal and apical dendrites. In summary, basal and apical dendritic synaptic plasticity and spike excitability are facilitated at different  phases in a compartmental fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Stroke recovery in rats after 24h‐delayed, intramuscular neurotrophin‐3 infusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25386?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophin‐3 (NT3) plays a key role in the development and function of locomotor circuits including descending serotonergic and corticospinal tract (CST) axons and afferents from muscle and skin. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into affected forelimb muscles improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move towards the clinic, we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats received unilateral ischemic stroke in sensorimotor cortex. To simulate a clinically‐feasible time‐to‐treat, twenty‐four hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into affected &lt;i&gt;triceps brachii&lt;/i&gt; for four weeks using implanted catheters and minipumps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiolabelled NT3 crossed from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in rodents with or without strokes. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory impairment of the affected wrist. fMRI during stimulation of the affected wrist showed spontaneous recovery of peri‐infarct BOLD signal that NT3 did not further enhance. Rather, NT3 induced neuroplasticity of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of NT3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral, high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Perceptual reversals in binocular rivalry: improved detection from OKN. (arXiv:1812.02478v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02478</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02478</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When binocular rivalry is induced by opponent motion displays, perceptual
reversals are often associated with changed oculomotor behaviour (Frassle et
al., 2014; Fujiwara et al., 2017). Specifically, the direction of smooth
pursuit phases in optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) typically corresponds to the
direction of motion that dominates perceptual appearance at any given time.
Here we report an improved analysis that continuously estimates perceived
motion in terms of `cumulative smooth pursuit'. In essence, smooth pursuit
segments are identified, interpolated where necessary, and joined
probabilistically into a continuous record of `cumulative smooth pursuit'
(i.e., a probability of eye position disregarding blinks, saccades, signal
losses, and artefacts). The analysis is fully automated and robust in healthy,
developmental, and patient populations. To validate reliability, we compare
volitional reports of perceptual reversals in rivalry displays, and of physical
reversals in non-rivalrous control displays. `Cumulative smooth pursuit'
detects physical reversals and estimates eye velocity more accurately than
existing methods do (Frassle et al., 2014). It also appears to distinguish
dominant and transitional perceptual states, detecting changes with a precision
of $\pm100\,\mathit{ms}$. We conclude that `cumulative smooth pursuit'
significantly improves the monitoring of binocular rivalry by means of
recording OKN.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Immersion in a creative task can be an intimate experience. It can feel like
a mystery: intangible, inexplicable, and beyond the reach of science. However,
science is making exciting headway into understanding creativity. While the
mind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items
accumulated through direct experience and enculturation, the mind of a creative
individual is self-organizing and self-mending; thus, experiences and items of
cultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that
they cohere together into a loosely integrated whole. The reweaving of items in
memory is elicited by perturbations: experiences that increase psychological
entropy because they are inconsistent with one's web of understandings. The
process of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations,
i.e., other inconsistencies in one's web of understandings. Creative thinking
often requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of
thought in response to the ever-changing demands of the creative task. Since
uncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating
creators, using their inventions, or purchasing their artworks, it is not
necessary that everyone be creative. Agent based computer models of cultural
evolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and
uncreative individuals. The ideal ratio of creativity to imitation increases in
times of change, such as we are experiencing now. Therefore it is important to
educate the next generation in ways that foster creativity. The chapter
concludes with suggestions for how educational systems can cultivate
creativity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Detecting Epileptic Seizures from EEG Data using Neural Networks. (arXiv:1412.6502v5 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6502</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6502</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore the use of neural networks trained with dropout in predicting
epileptic seizures from electroencephalographic data (scalp EEG). The input to
the neural network is a 126 feature vector containing 9 features for each of
the 14 EEG channels obtained over 1-second, non-overlapping windows. The models
in our experiments achieved high sensitivity and specificity on patient records
not used in the training process. This is demonstrated using
leave-one-out-cross-validation across patient records, where we hold out one
patient's record as the test set and use all other patients' records for
training; repeating this procedure for all patients in the database.

Several recent reviews have comprehensively discussed the molecular and functional diversity of mammalian astrocytes. In this brief review, we emphasize interspecies comparisons and an evolutionary perspective regarding the astro(glia) of vertebrates and invertebrates which are similar in form and function. This analysis has revealed conserved astrocyte transcriptomes in the fly, mouse and human. We also offer opinions about the pattern and origin of astrocyte heterogeneity in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The Sae2/CtIP protein is required for efficient processing of DNA double-strand breaks that initiate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Sae2/CtIP is also important for survival of single-stranded Top1-induced lesions and CtIP is known to associate directly with transcription-associated complexes in mammalian cells. Here we investigate the role of Sae2/CtIP at single-strand lesions in budding yeast and in human cells and find that depletion of Sae2/CtIP promotes the accumulation of stalled RNA polymerase and RNA-DNA hybrids at sites of highly expressed genes. Overexpression of the RNA-DNA helicase Senataxin suppresses DNA damage sensitivity and R-loop accumulation in Sae2/CtIP-deficient cells, and a catalytic mutant of CtIP fails to complement this sensitivity, indicating a role for CtIP nuclease activity in the repair process. Based on this evidence, we propose that R-loop processing by 5' flap endonucleases is a necessary step in the stabilization and removal of nascent R-loop initiating structures in eukaryotic cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A novel pathway of LPS uptake through syndecan-1 leading to pyroptotic cell death</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37854</link>
	<description>Intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, resulting in pyroptosis of innate immune cells. In addition to its well-known proinflammatory role, LPS can directly cause regression of some tumors, although the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here we show that secretoglobin(SCGB)3A2, a small protein predominantly secreted in airways, chaperones LPS to the cytosol through the cell surface receptor syndecan-1; this leads to pyroptotic cell death driven by caspase-11. SCGB3A2 and LPS co-treatment significantly induced pyroptosis of macrophage RAW264.7 cells and decreased cancer cell proliferation in vitro, while SCGB3A2 treatment resulted in reduced progression of xenograft tumors in mice. These data suggest a conserved function for SCGB3A2 in the innate immune system and cancer cells. These findings demonstrate a critical role for SCGB3A2 as an LPS delivery vehicle; they reveal one mechanism whereby LPS enters innate immune cells leading to pyroptosis, and they clarify the direct effect of LPS on cancer cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Spatial sampling in human visual cortex is modulated by both spatial and feature-based attention</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36928</link>
	<description>Spatial attention changes the sampling of visual space. Behavioral studies suggest that feature-based attention modulates this resampling to optimize the attended feature's sampling. We investigate this hypothesis by estimating spatial sampling in visual cortex while independently varying both feature-based and spatial attention. Our results show that spatial and feature-based attention interacted: resampling of visual space depended on both the attended location and feature (color vs. temporal frequency). This interaction occurred similarly throughout visual cortex, regardless of an area's overall feature preference. However, the interaction did depend on spatial sampling properties of voxels that prefer the attended feature. These findings are parsimoniously explained by variations in the precision of an attentional gain field. Our results demonstrate that the deployment of spatial attention is tailored to the spatial sampling properties of units that are sensitive to the attended feature.</description>

	<description>The three-dimensional organization of DNA is increasingly understood to play a decisive role in vital cellular processes. Many studies focus on the role of DNA-packaging proteins, crowding, and confinement in arranging chromatin, but structural information might also be directly encoded in bare DNA itself. Here we visualize plectonemes (extended intertwined DNA structures formed upon supercoiling) on individual DNA molecules. Remarkably, our experiments show that the DNA sequence directly encodes the structure of supercoiled DNA by pinning plectonemes at specific sequences. We develop a physical model that predicts that sequence-dependent intrinsic curvature is the key determinant of pinning strength and demonstrate this simple model provides very good agreement with the data. Analysis of several prokaryotic genomes indicates that plectonemes localize directly upstream of promoters, which we experimentaly confirm for selected promotor sequences. Our findings reveal a hidden code in the genome that helps to spatially organize the chromosomal DNA.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Emergence of Coordinated Activity in the Developing Entorhinal–Hippocampal Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy309</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Correlated activity in the entorhinal–hippocampal neuronal networks, supported by oscillatory and intermittent population activity patterns is critical for learning and memory. However, when and how correlated activity emerges in these networks during development remains largely unknown. Here, we found that during the first postnatal week in non-anaesthetized head-restrained rats, activity in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus was highly correlated, with intermittent population bursts in the MEC followed by early sharp waves (eSPWs) in the hippocampus. Neurons in the superficial MEC layers fired before neurons in the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1. eSPW current-source density profiles indicated that perforant/temporoammonic entorhinal inputs and intrinsic hippocampal connections are co-activated during entorhinal–hippocampal activity bursts. Finally, a majority of the entorhinal–hippocampal bursts were triggered by spontaneous myoclonic body movements, characteristic of the neonatal period. Thus, during the neonatal period, activity in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus is highly synchronous, with the EC leading hippocampal activation. We propose that such correlated activity is embedded into a large-scale bottom-up circuit that processes somatosensory feedback resulting from neonatal movements, and that it is likely to instruct the development of connections between neocortex and hippocampus.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Direct and Collateral Alterations of Functional Cortical Circuits in a Rat Model of Subcortical Band Heterotopia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy307</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as double-cortex syndrome, is a neuronal migration disorder characterized by an accumulation of neurons in a heterotopic band below the normotopic cortex. The majority of patients with SBH have mild to moderate intellectual disability and intractable epilepsy. However, it is still not clear how cortical networks are organized in SBH patients and how this abnormal organization contributes to improper brain function. In this study, cortical networks were investigated in the barrel cortex in an animal model of SBH induced by &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in utero&lt;/span&gt; knockdown of Dcx, main causative gene of this condition in human patients. When the SBH was localized below the Barrel Field (BF), layer (L) four projection to correctly positioned L2/3 pyramidal cells was weakened due to lower connectivity. Conversely, when the SBH was below an adjacent cortical region, the excitatory L4 to L2/3 projection was stronger due to increased L4 neuron excitability, synaptic strength and excitation/inhibition ratio of L4 to L2/3 connection. We propose that these developmental alterations contribute to the spectrum of clinical dysfunctions reported in patients with SBH.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neurons in the Macaque Dorsal Premotor Cortex Respond to Execution and Observation of Actions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy304</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy304/5232540?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We identified neurons in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of the macaque brain that respond during execution and observation of reaching-to-grasp actions, thus fulfilling the mirror neuron (MirN) criterion. During observation, the percentage of grip-selective MirNs in PMd and area F5 were comparable, and the selectivity indices in the two areas were similar. During execution, F5-MirNs were more selective than PMd–MirNs for grip, which was reflected in the higher selectivity indices in F5 than in PMd. PMd displayed grip-related information earlier than F5 during both conditions. In both areas, the number of neurons exhibiting congruent visual and motor selectivity did not differ from that expected by chance. However, both the PMd and F5 neuronal ensembles provided observation–execution matching, suggesting that the congruency may be achieved in a distributed fashion across the selective elements of the population. Furthermore, representational similarity analysis revealed that grip encoding in PMd and F5 is alike during both observation and execution. Our study provides direct evidence of mirror activity in PMd during observation of forelimb movements, and suggests that PMd is a node of the MirN circuit.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Development and Emergence of Individual Variability in the Functional Connectivity Architecture of the Preterm Human Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individual variability in human brain networks underlies individual differences in cognition and behaviors. However, researchers have not conclusively determined when individual variability patterns of the brain networks emerge and how they develop in the early phase. Here, we employed resting-state functional MRI data and whole-brain functional connectivity analyses in 40 neonates aged around 31–42 postmenstrual weeks to characterize the spatial distribution and development modes of individual variability in the functional network architecture. We observed lower individual variability in primary sensorimotor and visual areas and higher variability in association regions at the third trimester, and these patterns are generally similar to those of adult brains. Different functional systems showed dramatic differences in the development of individual variability, with significant decreases in the sensorimotor network; decreasing trends in the visual, subcortical, and dorsal and ventral attention networks, and limited change in the default mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks. The patterns of individual variability were negatively correlated with the short- to middle-range connection strength/number and this distance constraint was significantly strengthened throughout development. Our findings highlight the development and emergence of individual variability in the functional architecture of the prenatal brain, which may lay network foundations for individual behavioral differences later in life.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Age-Related Differences in Brain Morphology and the Modifiers in Middle-Aged and Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain structural morphology differs with age. This study examined age-differences in surface-based morphometric measures of cortical thickness, volume, and surface area in a well-defined sample of 8137 generally healthy UK Biobank participants aged 45–79 years. We illustrate that the complexity of age-related brain morphological differences may be related to the laminar organization and regional evolutionary history of the cortex, and age of about 60 is a break point for increasing negative associations between age and brain morphology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-prone areas. We also report novel relationships of age-related cortical differences with individual factors of sex, cognitive functions of fluid intelligence, reaction time and prospective memory, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep disruption, genetic markers of apolipoprotein E, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, catechol-O-methyltransferase, and several genome-wide association study loci for AD and further reveal joint effects of cognitive functions, lifestyle behaviors, and education on age-related cortical differences. These findings provide one of the most extensive characterizations of age associations with major brain morphological measures and improve our understanding of normal structural brain aging and its potential modifiers.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Enables Updating of Established Memories</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Updating established memories in light of new information is fundamental for memory to guide future behavior. However, little is known about the brain mechanisms by which existing memories can be updated. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate representational similarity analysis to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the updating of consolidated memories. To this end, participants first learned face–city name pairs. Twenty-four hours later, while lying in the MRI scanner, participants were required to update some of these associations, but not others, and to encode entirely new pairs. Updating success was tested again 24 h later. Our results showed increased activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) specifically during the updating of existing associations that was significantly stronger than when simple retrieval or new encoding was required. The updating-related activity of the dlPFC and its functional connectivity with the hippocampus were directly linked to updating success. Furthermore, neural similarity for updated items was markedly higher in the dlPFC and this increase in dlPFC neural similarity distinguished individuals with high updating performance from those with low updating performance. Together, these findings suggest a key role of the dlPFC, presumably in interaction with the hippocampus, in the updating of established memories.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early Loss of Vision Results in Extensive Reorganization of Plasticity-Related Receptors and Alterations in Hippocampal Function That Extend Through Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although by adulthood cortical structures and their capacity for processing sensory information have become established and stabilized, under conditions of cortical injury, or sensory deprivation, rapid reorganization occurs. Little is known as to the impact of this kind of adaptation on cellular processes related to memory encoding. However, imaging studies in humans suggest that following loss or impairment of a sensory modality, not only cortical but also subcortical structures begin to reorganize. It is likely that these processes are supported by neurotransmitter receptors that enable synaptic and cortical plasticity. Here, we explored to what extent the expression of plasticity-related proteins (GABA-A, GABA-B, GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B) is altered following early vision loss, and whether this impacts on hippocampal function. We observed that in the period of 2–4 months postnatally in CBA/J-mice that experience hereditary postnatal retinal degeneration, systematic changes of GABA-receptor and NMDA-receptor subunit expression occurred that emerged first in the hippocampus and developed later in the cortex, compared to control mice that had normal vision. Changes were accompanied by significant impairments in hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent learning. These data indicate that during cortical adaptation to early loss of vision, hippocampal information processing is compromised, and this status impacts on the acquisition of spatial representations.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Lesions to the Fronto-Parietal Network Impact Alpha-Band Phase Synchrony and Cognitive Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy296</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Long-range phase synchrony in the α-oscillation band (near 10 Hz) has been proposed to facilitate information integration across anatomically segregated regions. Which areas may top-down regulate such cross-regional integration is largely unknown. We previously found that the moment-to-moment strength of high-α band (10–12 Hz) phase synchrony co-varies with activity in a fronto-parietal (FP) network. This network is critical for adaptive cognitive control functions such as cognitive flexibility required during set-shifting. Using electroencephalography (EEG) in 23 patients with focal frontal lobe lesions (resected tumors), we tested the hypothesis that the FP network is necessary for modulation of high-α band phase synchrony. Global phase-synchrony was measured using an adaptation of the phase-locking value (PLV) in a sliding window procedure, which allowed for measurement of changes in EEG-based resting-state functional connectivity across time. As hypothesized, the temporal modulation (range and standard deviation) of high-α phase synchrony was reduced as a function of FP network lesion extent, mostly due to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) lesions. Furthermore, patients with dlPFC lesions exhibited reduced cognitive flexibility as measured by the Trail-Making Test (set-shifting). Our findings provide evidence that the FP network is necessary for modulatory control of high-α band long-range phase synchrony, and linked to cognitive flexibility.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Oxytocin Modulates the Intrinsic Dynamics Between Attention-Related Large-Scale Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention and salience processing have been linked to the intrinsic between- and within-network dynamics of large-scale networks engaged in internal (default network [DN]) and external attention allocation (dorsal attention network [DAN] and salience network [SN]). The central oxytocin (OXT) system appears ideally organized to modulate widely distributed neural systems and to regulate the switch between internal attention and salient stimuli in the environment. The current randomized placebo (PLC)-controlled between-subject pharmacological resting-state fMRI study in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 187 (OXT, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 94; PLC, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 93; single-dose intranasal administration) healthy male and female participants employed an independent component analysis approach to determine the modulatory effects of OXT on the within- and between-network dynamics of the DAN–SN–DN triple network system. OXT increased the functional integration between subsystems within SN and DN and increased functional segregation of the DN with both attentional control networks (SN and DAN). Whereas no sex differences were observed, OXT effects on the DN–SN interaction were modulated by autistic traits. Together, the findings suggest that OXT may facilitate efficient attention allocation by modulating the intrinsic functional dynamics between DN components and large-scale networks involved in external attentional demands (SN and DAN).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Different Decision-Making Responses Occupy Different Brain Networks for Information Processing: A Study Based on EEG and TMS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy294</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy294/5232531?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;This study used large-scale time-varying network analysis to reveal the diverse network patterns during the different decision stages and found that the responses of rejection and acceptance involved different network structures. When participants accept unfair offers, the brain recruits a more bottom-up mechanism with a much stronger information flow from the visual cortex (O2) to the frontal area, but when they reject unfair offers, it displayed a more top-down flow derived from the frontal cortex (Fz) to the parietal and occipital cortices. Furthermore, we performed 2 additional studies to validate the above network models: one was to identify the 2 responses based on the out-degree information of network hub nodes, which results in 70% accuracy, and the other utilized theta burst stimulation (TBS) of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate the frontal area before the decision-making tasks. We found that the intermittent TBS group demonstrated lower acceptance rates and that the continuous TBS group showed higher acceptance rates compared with the sham group. Similar effects were not observed after TBS of a control site. These results suggest that the revealed decision-making network model can serve as a potential intervention model to alter decision responses.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early Excitatory Activity-Dependent Maturation of Somatostatin Interneurons in Cortical Layer 2/3 of Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABAergic interneurons perform distinct functions during cortical development in the mouse brain. Among the diverse GABAergic neurons present in the brain, early-born somatostatin (SST)-expressing inhibitory interneurons, which are innervated by other interneurons and local pyramidal cells (PCs), act in a neural computational role in circuitry regulation. The synapses between the SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons and other cells form gradually during development. Here, we traced the developmental course of the electrophysiological properties of SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons at layer 2/3 of the neocortical secondary motor area (M2) in mouse, and the synaptic connectivity between SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons and PCs. Also, we used toxin-mediated and genetic method to suppress the activities of PCs, and demonstrate that decreasing excitatory input at early stage (before P1) rather than late stage (after P8) would delay the functional maturation of SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. In conclusion, our results indicate that early functional activity of PCs is crucial for the intrinsic maturation of SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, following which these interneurons participate in local circuitry.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Temporally Unconstrained Decoding Reveals Consistent but Time-Varying Stages of Stimulus Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In this article, we propose a method to track trial-specific neural dynamics of stimulus processing and decision making with high temporal precision. By applying this novel method to a perceptual template-matching task, we tracked representational brain states associated with the cascade of neural processing, from early sensory areas to higher order areas that are involved in integration and decision making. We address a major limitation of the traditional decoding approach: that it relies on consistent timing of these processes over trials. Using a TUDA approach, we found that the timing of the cognitive processes involved in perceptual judgments can vary considerably over trials. This revealed that the sequence of processing states was consistent for all subjects and trials, even when the timing of these states varied. Furthermore, we found that the specific timing of states on each trial was related to the quality of performance over trials. Altogether, this work not only highlights the serious pitfalls and misleading interpretations that result from assuming stimulus processing to be synchronous across trials but can also open important avenues to investigate learning and quantify plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Role of the Human Auditory Corticostriatal Network in Speech Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy289</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We establish a mechanistic account of how the mature human brain functionally reorganizes to acquire and represent new speech sounds. Native speakers of English learned to categorize Mandarin lexical tone categories produced by multiple talkers using trial-by-trial feedback. We hypothesized that the corticostriatal system is a key intermediary in mediating temporal lobe plasticity and the acquisition of new speech categories in adulthood. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which participants underwent a sound-to-category mapping task. Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected, and probabilistic fiber tracking analysis was employed to assay the auditory corticostriatal pathways. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that talker-invariant novel tone category representations emerged in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) within a few hundred training trials. Univariate analysis showed that the putamen, a subregion of the striatum, was sensitive to positive feedback in correctly categorized trials. With learning, functional coupling between the putamen and LSTG increased during error processing. Furthermore, fiber tractography demonstrated robust structural connectivity between the feedback-sensitive striatal regions and the LSTG regions that represent the newly learned tone categories. Our convergent findings highlight a critical role for the auditory corticostriatal circuitry in mediating the acquisition of new speech categories.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Transcriptomic Landscape of von Economo Neurons in Human Anterior Cingulate Cortex Revealed by Microdissected-Cell RNA Sequencing</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The von Economo neurons (VENs) are specialized large bipolar projection neurons with restricted distribution in the human brain, and they are far more abundant in humans than in non-human primates. However, VEN functions remain elusive due to the difficulty of isolating VENs and dissecting their connections in the brain. Here, we combined laser-capture-microdissection with RNA sequencing to describe the transcriptomic profile of VENs from human anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using pyramidal neurons as reference cells, we identified 344 genes with VEN-associated expression differences, including 215 higher and 129 lower expression genes. Functional enrichment and protein–protein interaction network analyses showed that these genes with VEN-associated expression differences are involved in VEN morphogenesis and functions, such as dendrite branching and axon myelination, and many of them are associated with human social-emotional disorders. With the use of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; hybridization and immunohistochemistry assays, we validated four novel VEN markers (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;VAT1L&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CHST8&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;LYPD1&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SULF2&lt;/span&gt;). Collectively, we generated a full-spectrum expression profile of VENs from human ACC, greatly enlarging the pool of genes with VEN-associated expression differences that can help researchers to understand the role of VENs in normal and disordered human brains.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA binding domain across eukaryotic proteins. It is therefore of great value to engineer its specificity to target RNAs of arbitrary sequence. This was recently achieved for the RRM in Rbfox protein, where four mutations R118D, E147R, N151S, and E152T were designed to target the precursor to the oncogenic miRNA 21. Here, we used a variety of molecular dynamics-based approaches to predict specific interactions at the binding interface. Overall, we have run approximately 50 microseconds of enhanced sampling and plain molecular dynamics simulations on the engineered complex as well as on the wild-type Rbfox·pre-miRNA 20b from which the mutated systems were designed. Comparison with the available NMR data on the wild type molecules (protein, RNA, and their complex) served to establish the accuracy of the calculations.
Free energy calculations suggest that further improvements in affinity and selectivity are achieved by the S151T replacement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TuCEybsNySU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neural morphology and membrane properties vary greatly between cell types in the nervous system. The computations and local circuit connectivity that neurons support are thought to be the key factors constraining the cells’ biophysical properties. Nevertheless, additional constraints can be expected to further shape neuronal design. Here, we focus on a particularly energy-intense system (as indicated by metabolic markers): principal neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) nucleus of the auditory brainstem. Based on a modeling approach, we show that a trade-off between the level of performance of a functionally relevant computation and energy consumption predicts optimal ranges for cell morphology and membrane properties. The biophysical parameters appear most strongly constrained by functional needs, while energy use is minimized as long as function can be maintained. The key factors that determine model performance and energy consumption are 1) the saturation of the synaptic conductance input and 2) the temporal resolution of the postsynaptic signals as they reach the soma, which is largely determined by active membrane properties. MSO cells seem to operate close to pareto optimality, i.e., the trade-off boundary between performance and energy consumption that is formed by the set of optimal models. Good performance for drastically lower costs could in theory be achieved by small neurons without dendrites, as seen in the avian auditory system, pointing to additional constraints for mammalian MSO cells, including their circuit connectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zTIR8s50uCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian adaptive dual controller (ADC) for autonomously programming deep brain stimulation devices. We evaluated the Bayesian ADC’s performance in the context of reducing beta power in a computational model of Parkinson’s disease, in which it was tasked with finding the set of stimulation parameters which optimally reduced beta power as fast as possible. Here, the Bayesian ADC has dual goals: (a) to minimize beta power by exploiting the best parameters found so far, and (b) to explore the space to find better parameters, thus allowing for better control in the future. The Bayesian ADC is composed of two parts: an inner parameterized feedback stimulator and an outer parameter adjustment loop. The inner loop operates on a short time scale, delivering stimulus based upon the phase and power of the beta oscillation. The outer loop operates on a long time scale, observing the effects of the stimulation parameters and using Bayesian optimization to intelligently select new parameters to minimize the beta power. We show that the Bayesian ADC can efficiently optimize stimulation parameters, and is superior to other optimization algorithms. The Bayesian ADC provides a robust and general framework for tuning stimulation parameters, can be adapted to use any feedback signal, and is applicable across diseases and stimulator designs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qPq3gWd425o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: COORDINATION BETWEEN PREFRONTAL CORTEX CLOCK GENE EXPRESSION AND CORTICOSTERONE CONTRIBUTES TO ENHANCED CONDITIONED FEAR EXTINCTION RECALL</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;PTSD is associated with impaired conditioned fear extinction learning, a ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) dependent process. PTSD is also associated with dysregulation of vmPFC, circadian and glucocorticoid hormone function. Rats have rhythmic clock gene expression in the vmPFC that requires appropriate diurnal circulatory patterns of corticosterone (CORT), suggesting the presence of CORT-entrained intrinsic circadian clock function within the PFC. We examined the role of vmPFC clock gene expression and its interaction with CORT profiles in regulation of auditory conditioned fear extinction learning. Extinction learning and recall were examined in male rats trained and tested either in the night (active phase) or in the day (inactive phase). Using a viral vector strategy, &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; clock gene expression were selectively knocked down within the vmPFC. Circulating CORT profiles were manipulated via adrenalectomy (ADX) ± diurnal and acute CORT replacement. Rats trained and tested during the night exhibited superior conditioned fear extinction recall that was absent in rats that had knockdown of vmPFC clock gene expression. Similarly, the superior nighttime extinction recall was absent in ADX rats, but restored in ADX rats given a combination of a diurnal pattern of CORT and acute elevation of CORT during the post-extinction training consolidation period. Thus, conditioned fear extinction learning is regulated in a diurnal fashion that requires normal vmPFC clock gene expression and a combination of circadian and training-associated CORT. Strategic manipulation of these factors may enhance the therapeutic outcome of conditioned fear extinction related treatments in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is associated with deficits in conditioned fear extinction learning, a prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent process, as well as dysregulation of circadian and glucocorticoid hormone function. We examined the role of glucocorticoid-entrained clock gene expression within the PFC on conditioned fear extinction learning, and its interaction with glucocorticoid hormone profiles. We found a prominent time of day difference in extinction recall—superior recall in rats trained and tested at night. This superior recall required normal PFC clock gene expression as well as a combination of a diurnal pattern of circulating glucocorticoids and an acute elevation of glucocorticoids during the extinction learning memory consolidation period. Appropriate alignment of these factors in the clinical setting may enhance extinction learning related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Impaired cognitive function after perineuronal net degradation in the medial prefrontal cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are highly organized components of the extracellular matrix that surround a subset of mature neurons in the central nervous system. These structures play a critical role in regulating neuronal plasticity, particularly during neurodevelopment. Consistent with this role, their presence is associated with functional and structural stability of the neurons they ensheath. A loss of PNNs in the prefrontal cortex has been suggested to contribute to cognitive impairment in disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the direct consequences of PNN loss in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on cognition has not been demonstrated. Here, we examined behavior after disruption of PNNs in mPFC of Long-Evans rats following injection of the enzyme Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC). Our data show that ChABC-treated animals were impaired on tests of object oddity perception. Performance in the cross-modal object recognition task was not significantly different for ChABC-treated rats, although ChABC-treated rats were not able to perform above chance levels whereas control rats were. ChABC treated animals were not significantly different from controls on tests of prepulse inhibition, set-shifting, reversal learning, or tactile and visual object recognition memory. Posthumous immunohistochemistry confirmed significantly reduced PNNs in mPFC due to ChABC treatment. Moreover, PNN density in the mPFC predicted performance on the oddity task, where higher PNN density was associated with better performance. These findings suggest that PNN loss within the mPFC impairs some aspects of object oddity perception and recognition and that PNNs contribute to cognitive function in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are organized components of the extracellular matrix that surround mature central nervous system neurons and are critical for the regulation of neuronal plasticity. A loss of PNNs has been observed in schizophrenia and other central nervous system diseases but the exact functional contribution of these structures or the consequences of their loss are not well understood. Here, we show that targeted degradation of PNNs within the medial prefrontal cortex disrupts performance of some tests of object oddity perception and recognition memory. These findings suggest that PNNs and their loss in CNS diseases may contribute directly to the presentation of cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sampling regulates stimulus intensity and temporal dynamics at the sense organ. Despite variations in sampling behavior, animals must make veridical perceptual judgments about external stimuli. In olfaction, odor sampling varies with respiration, which influences neural responses at the olfactory periphery. Nevertheless, rats were able to perform fine odor intensity judgments despite variations in sniff kinetics. To identify the features of neural activity supporting stable intensity perception, in awake mice we measured responses of Mitral/Tufted (MT) cells to different odors and concentrations across a range of sniff frequencies. Amplitude and latency of the MT cells’ responses vary with sniff duration. A fluid dynamics (FD) model based on odor concentration kinetics in the intranasal cavity can account for this variability. Eliminating sniff waveform dependence of MT cell responses using the FD model allows for significantly better decoding of concentration. This suggests potential schemes for sniff waveform invariant odor concentration coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; The principles underlying invariant object recognition are of broad interest. The sensory stimuli are subject to external variability, and variability imposed by animal behavior. In olfaction active sampling, sniffing, regulates stimulus intensity and temporal dynamics at the sense organ. Does this interfere with the ability to make accurate perceptual judgments about the physical stimulus? To address this question we initially established that perception of odor intensity is not affected by variations in sampling using behavioral experiments. To identify the features of neural activity that support this invariance in intensity perception, we developed a fluid dynamics model based on odor kinetics in the nose.

	<title>RSS PAP: An efficient population density method for modeling neural networks with synaptic dynamics manifesting finite relaxation time and short-term plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;When incorporating more realistic synaptic dynamics, the computational efficiency of population density methods (PDMs) declines sharply due to the increase in the dimension of master equations. To avoid such a decline, we develop an efficient PDM, termed colored-synapse PDM (csPDM), in which the dimension of the master equations does not depend on the number of synapse-associated state variables in the underlying network model. Our goal is to allow the PDM to incorporate realistic synaptic dynamics that possesses not only finite relaxation time but also short-term plasticity. The model equations of csPDM are derived based on the diffusion approximation on synaptic dynamics and probability density function methods for Langevin equations with colored noise. Numerical examples, given by simulations of the population dynamics of uncoupled exponential integrate-and-fire neurons, show good agreement between the results of csPDM and Monte-Carlo simulations. Compared to the original full-dimensional PDM, the csPDM reveals more excellent computational efficiency because of the lower dimension of the master equations. In addition, it permits network dynamics to possess the short-term plastic characteristics inherited from plastic synapses. The novel csPDM has potential applicability to any spiking neuron models because of no assumptions on neuronal dynamics, and, more importantly, this is the first report of PDM to successfully encompass short-term facilitation/depression properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our study successfully solve an outstanding problem—how to reduce the dimension of population density equations when realistic synaptic dynamics is incorporated. With the newly proposed Fokker-Planck formalism, PDM is conferred STP properties and therefore becomes more widely applicable. As such, our method offers an opportunity to use the PDM to gain new insights into neural mechanisms of brain functions that are strongly dependent on STP synapses. This is the first step toward macroscopic description of large-scale neural network activities, reflected in some commonly used neurophysiological measurements, e.g., EEG, MEG, fMRI and voltage-sensitive dye imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Embryonic Neocortical Microglia Express Toll-Like Receptor 9 and Respond to Plasmid DNA Injected into the Ventricle: Technical Considerations Regarding Microglial Distribution in Electroporated Brain Walls</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the resident immune cells in the CNS, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, partially restored the dispersed intramural localization of microglia and significantly decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite much attention to the use of biomarkers for predicting Alzheimer's disease, little information is available at the individual level. We used the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging to estimate absolute risk of cognitive impairment by biomarker group. Risk increased with age and any biomarker abnormality. For example, a 75‐year‐old with abnormal amyloid and cortical thinning biomarkers has ≈20% chance of cognitive impairment by age 80 whereas with normal biomarkers the chance is &amp;lt;10%. Persons with only one abnormal biomarker had similar intermediate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Differential placebo effects’ is the concept that different types of placebos (e.g. inert pill versus sham device) may yield different magnitudes of placebo effects. This issue has been pushed into the spotlight by recent clinical trials of new technologies reporting unexpectedly large placebo effects from sham devices/procedures needed to maintain blinding integrity. In this Neurology Grand Rounds, we use transcranial magnetic stimulation as a model to explore the principles and implications of differential placebo effects. We highlight emerging research on the neurobiology of placebo effects and analyze fundamental questions of measuring efficacy in contemporary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature is in constant flux, so animals must account for changes in their
environment when making decisions. How animals learn the timescale of such
changes and adapt their decision strategies accordingly is not well understood.
Recent psychophysical experiments have shown humans and other animals can
achieve near-optimal performance at two alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks
in dynamically changing environments. Characterization of performance requires
the derivation and analysis of computational models of optimal decision-making
policies on such tasks. We review recent theoretical work in this area, and
discuss how models compare with subjects' behavior in tasks where the correct
choice or evidence quality changes in dynamic, but predictable, ways.

	<description>The XPD family of helicases, that includes human disease-related FANCJ, DDX11 and RTEL1, are Superfamily 2 helicases that contain an iron-sulphur cluster domain, translocate on ssDNA in a 5'-3' direction and play important roles in genome stability. Consequently, mutations in several of these family members in eukaryotes cause human diseases. Family members in bacteria, such as the DinG helicase from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, are also involved in DNA repair. Here we present crystal structures of complexes of DinG bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the presence and absence of an ATP analogue (ADP•BeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), that suggest a mechanism for 5'-3' translocation along the ssDNA substrate. This proposed mechanism has implications for how those enzymes of the XPD family that recognise bulky DNA lesionsmight stall at these as the first step in initiating DNA repair. Biochemical data reveal roles for conserved residues that are mutated in human diseases.</description>

Recent electron microscopy data have revealed that cardiac mitochondria are not arranged in crystalline columns but are organised with several mitochondria aggregated into columns of varying sizes often spanning the cell cross-section. This raises the question—how does the mitochondrial arrangement affect the metabolite distributions within cardiomyocytes and their impact on force dynamics? Here we employed finite element modelling of cardiac bioenergetics, using computational meshes derived from electron microscope images, to address this question. Our results indicate that heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions can lead to significant spatial variation across the cell in concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine (Cr) and creatine phosphate (PCr). However, our model predicts that sufficient activity of the creatine kinase (CK) system, coupled with rapid diffusion of Cr and PCr, maintains near uniform ATP and ADP ratios across the cell cross sections. This homogenous distribution of ATP and ADP should also evenly distribute force production and twitch duration with contraction. These results suggest that the PCr shuttle, and associated enzymatic reactions, act to maintain uniform force dynamics in the cell despite the heterogeneous mitochondrial organization. However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia—activity of mitochondrial CK enzyme and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2tbMz5eg2PA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

New genome wide approaches have revealed that ARG programs are highly cell-type-specific, raising the possibility that they mediate different forms of experience-dependent plasticity in different cell types. The cell-type specificity of these gene programs is achieved by a combination of cell-intrinsic mechanisms that determine the transcriptional response of each neuronal subtype to a given stimulus and by cell-extrinsic mechanisms that influence the nature of the stimulus a cell receives. A better understanding of these mechanisms could usher in an era of molecular systems neuroscience in which genetic perturbations of cell-type-specific plasticities are assessed using electrophysiology and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; imaging to reveal the neural basis of adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Global Connectivity and Function of Descending Spinal Input Revealed by 3D Microscopy and Retrograde Transduction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10566?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain communicates with the spinal cord through numerous axon tracts that arise from discrete nuclei, transmit distinct functions, and often collateralize to facilitate the coordination of descending commands. This complexity presents a major challenge to interpreting functional outcomes from therapies that target supraspinal connectivity after injury or disease, while the wide distribution of supraspinal nuclei complicates the delivery of therapeutics. Here we harness retrograde viral vectors to overcome these challenges. We demonstrate that injection of AAV2-Retro to the cervical spinal cord of adult female mice results in highly efficient transduction of supraspinal populations throughout the brainstem, midbrain, and cortex. Some supraspinal populations, including corticospinal and rubrospinal neurons, were transduced with &amp;gt;90% efficiency, with robust transgene expression within 3 d of injection. In contrast, propriospinal and raphe spinal neurons showed much lower rates of retrograde transduction. Using tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy we present detailed visualizations of descending axons tracts and create a mesoscopic projectome for the spinal cord. Moreover, chemogenetic silencing of supraspinal neurons with retrograde vectors resulted in complete and reversible forelimb paralysis, illustrating effective modulation of supraspinal function. Retrograde vectors were also highly efficient when injected after spinal injury, highlighting therapeutic potential. These data provide a global view of supraspinal connectivity and illustrate the potential of retrograde vectors to parse the functional contributions of supraspinal inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The complexity of descending inputs to the spinal cord presents a major challenge in efforts deliver therapeutics to widespread supraspinal systems, and to interpret their functional effects. Here we demonstrate highly effective gene delivery to diverse supraspinal nuclei using a retrograde viral approach and combine it with tissue clearing and 3D microscopy to map the descending projectome from brain to spinal cord. These data highlight newly developed retrograde viruses as therapeutic and research tools, while offering new insights into supraspinal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phosphocreatine Levels in the Left Thalamus Decline during Wakefulness and Increase after a Nap</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10552?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10552?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists have hypothesized that the availability of phosphocreatine (PCr) and its ratio to inorganic phosphate (Pi) in cerebral tissue form a substrate of wakefulness. It follows then, according to this hypothesis, that the exhaustion of PCr and the decline in the ratio of PCr to Pi form a substrate of fatigue. We used &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS) to investigate quantitative levels of PCr, the -signal of ATP, and Pi in 30 healthy humans (18 female) in the morning, in the afternoon, and while napping (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) versus awake controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10). Levels of PCr (2.40 mM at 9 A.M.) decreased by 7.0 ± 0.8% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 7.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–6&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = –5.5) in the left thalamus between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. Inversely, Pi (0.74 mM at 9 A.M.) increased by 17.1 ± 5% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 3.1) and pH levels dropped by 0.14 ± 0.07 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 3.6). Following a 20 min nap after 5 P.M., local PCr, Pi, and pH were restored to morning levels. We did not find respective significant changes in the contralateral thalamus or in other investigated brain regions. Left hemispheric PCr was signficantly lower than right hemispheric PCr only at 5 P.M. in the thalamus and at all conditions in the temporal region. Thus, cerebral daytime-related and sleep-related molecular changes are accessible &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Prominent changes were identified in the thalamus. This region is heavily relied on for a series of energy-consuming tasks, such as the relay of sensory information to the cortex. Furthermore, our data confirm that lateralization of brain function is regionally dynamic and includes PCr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The metabolites phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are assumed to inversely reflect the cellular energy load. This study detected a diurnal decrease of intracellular PCr and a nap-associated reincrease in the left thalamus. Pi behaved inversely. This outcome corroborates the role of the thalamus as a region of high energy consumption in agreement with its function as a gateway that relays and modulates information flow. Conversely to the dynamic lateralization of thalamic PCr, a constantly significant lateralization was observed in other regions. Increasing fatigue over the course of the day may also be a matter of cerebral energy supply. Comparatively fast restoration of that supply may be part of the biological basis for the recreational value of &quot;power napping.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Demethylation of G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 151 Promoter Facilitates the Binding of Krüppel-Like Factor 5 and Enhances Neuropathic Pain after Nerve Injury in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10535?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10535?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;G-protein-coupled receptors are considered to be cell-surface sensors of extracellular signals, thereby having a crucial role in signal transduction and being the most fruitful targets for drug discovery. G-protein-coupled receptor 151 (GPR151) was reported to be expressed specifically in the habenular area. Here we report the expression and the epigenetic regulation of GRP151 in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and the contribution of GPR151 to neuropathic pain in male mice. SNL dramatically increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; mutation or spinal inhibition by shRNA alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the CpG island in the &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter region was demethylated, the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased, and the binding of DNMT3b with &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; promoter was reduced after SNL. Overexpression of DNMT3b in the spinal cord decreased &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; expression and attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcriptional factor of the KLF family, was upregulated in spinal neurons, and the binding affinity of KLF5 with &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; promoter was increased after SNL. Inhibition of KLF5 reduced &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; expression and attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Further mRNA microarray analysis revealed that mutation of &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; reduced the expression of a variety of pain-related genes in response to SNL, especially mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-associated genes. This study reveals that GPR151, increased by DNA demethylation and the enhanced interaction with KLF5, contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain via increasing MAPK pathway-related gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of various clinically approved drugs. Here we report that SNL increased GPR151 expression in the spinal cord, and mutation or inhibition of GPR151 alleviated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. In addition, SNL downregulated the expression of DNMT3b, which caused demethylation of &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter, facilitated the binding of transcriptional factor KLF5 with the &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and further increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. The increased GPR151 may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain via activating MAPK signaling and increasing pain-related gene expression. Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism underlying GPR151 expression and suggests that targeting GPR151 may offer a new strategy for the treatment of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phase Synchronicity of {mu}-Rhythm Determines Efficacy of Interhemispheric Communication Between Human Motor Cortices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10525?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10525?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of communication through coherence predicts that effective connectivity between nodes in a distributed oscillating neuronal network depends on their instantaneous excitability state and phase synchronicity (Fries, 2005). Here, we tested this prediction by using state-dependent millisecond-resolved real-time electroencephalography-triggered dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) (Zrenner et al., 2018) to target the EEG-negative (high-excitability state) versus EEG-positive peak (low-excitability state) of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm in the left (conditioning) and right (test) motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy human subjects (9 female, 7 male). Effective connectivity was tested by short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI); that is, the inhibitory effect of the conditioning TMS pulse given 10–12 ms before the test pulse on the test motor-evoked potential. We compared the four possible combinations of excitability states (negative peak, positive peak) and phase relations (in-phase, out-of-phase) of the μ-rhythm in the conditioning and test M1 and a random phase condition. Strongest SIHI was found when the two M1 were in phase for the high-excitability state (negative peak of the μ-rhythm), whereas the weakest SIHI occurred when they were out of phase and the conditioning M1 was in the low-excitability state (positive peak). Phase synchronicity contributed significantly to SIHI variation, with stronger SIHI in the in-phase than out-of-phase conditions. These findings are in exact accord with the predictions of the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route for highly effective modification of brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time when nodes in the network are phase synchronized and excitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The theory of communication through coherence predicts that effective connectivity between nodes in distributed oscillating brain networks depends on their instantaneous excitability and phase relation. We tested this hypothesis in healthy human subjects by real-time analysis of brain states by electroencephalography in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation of left and right motor cortex. We found that short-interval interhemispheric inhibition, a marker of interhemispheric effective connectivity, was maximally expressed when the two motor cortices were in phase for a high-excitability state (the trough of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm). We conclude that findings are consistent with the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route to highly effectively modify brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time of phase-synchronized high-excitability states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Encoding of Reward and Decoding Movement from the Frontal Eye Field during Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10515?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10515?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Expectation of reward potentiates sensorimotor transformations to drive vigorous movements. One of the main challenges in studying reward is to determine how representations of reward interact with the computations that drive behavior. We recorded activity in smooth pursuit neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) of two male rhesus monkeys while controlling the eye speed by manipulating either reward size or target speed. The neurons encoded the different reward conditions more strongly than the different target speed conditions. This pattern could not be explained by differences in the eye speed, since the eye speed sensitivity of the neurons was also larger for the reward conditions. Pooling the responses by the preferred direction of the neurons attenuated the reward modulation and led to a tighter association between neural activity and behavior. Therefore, a plausible decoder such as the population vector could explain how the FEF both drives behavior and encodes reward beyond behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor areas combine sensory and reward information to drive movement. To disambiguate these sources, we manipulated the speed of smooth pursuit eye movements by controlling either the size of the reward or the speed of the visual motion signals. We found that the relationship between activity in frontal eye field and eye kinematics varied: the eye speed sensitivity was larger for the different reward conditions than for the different target speed conditions. Decoders that pooled signals by the preferred direction of the neurons attenuated the reward modulations. These decoders may indicate how reward can be both encoded beyond eye kinematics at the single neuron level and drive movement at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedforward and Feedback Control Share an Internal Model of the Arm's Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10505?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10505?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent work has shown that, when countering external forces, the nervous system adjusts not only predictive (i.e., feedforward) control of reaching but also reflex (i.e., feedback) responses to mechanical perturbations. Here we show that altering the physical properties of the arm (i.e., intersegmental dynamics) causes the nervous system to adjust feedforward control and that this learning transfers to feedback responses even though the latter were never directly trained. Forty-five human participants (30 females) performed a single-joint elbow reaching task and countered mechanical perturbations that created pure elbow motion. In our first experiment, we altered intersegmental dynamics by asking participants to generate pure elbow movements when the shoulder joint was either free to rotate or locked by the robotic manipulandum. With the shoulder unlocked, we found robust activation of shoulder flexor muscles for pure elbow flexion trials, as required to counter the interaction torques that arise at the shoulder because of forearm rotation. After locking the shoulder joint, which cancels these interaction torques, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder muscle activity over many trials. In our second experiment, we tested whether such learning transfers to feedback control. Mechanical perturbations applied to the arm with the shoulder unlocked revealed that feedback responses also account for intersegmental dynamics. After locking the shoulder joint, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder feedback responses, as appropriate for the altered intersegmental dynamics. Our work suggests that feedforward and feedback control share an internal model of the arm's dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we show that altering the physical properties of the arm causes people to learn new motor commands and that this learning transfers to their reflex responses to unexpected mechanical perturbations, even though the reflex responses were never directly trained. Our results suggest that feedforward motor commands and reflex responses share an internal model of the arm's dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 5-HT2A Receptor-Induced Morphological Reorganization of PKC{gamma}-Expressing Interneurons Gates Inflammatory Mechanical Allodynia in Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10489?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10489?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical allodynia, a widespread pain symptom that still lacks effective therapy, is associated with the activation of a dorsally directed polysynaptic circuit within the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) or medullary dorsal horn (MDH), whereby tactile inputs into deep SDH/MDH can gain access to superficial SDH/MDH, eliciting pain. Inner lamina II (II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) interneurons expressing the  isoform of protein kinase C (PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are key elements for allodynia circuits, but how they operate is still unclear. Combining behavioral, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological, and morphological approaches in an adult rat model of facial inflammatory pain (complete Freund's adjuvant, CFA), we show that the mechanical allodynia observed 1 h after CFA injection is associated with the following (1) sensitization (using ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a marker) and (2) reduced dendritic arborizations and enhanced spine density in exclusively PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, but (3) depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) in all lamina II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/PKC&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. Blocking MDH 5HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) prevents facial mechanical allodynia and associated changes in the morphology of PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, but not depolarized RMP in lamina II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; interneurons. Finally, activation of MDH 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R in naive animals is enough to reproduce the behavioral allodynia and morphological changes in PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, but not the electrophysiological changes in lamina II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; interneurons, induced by facial inflammation. This suggests that inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia involves strong morphological reorganization of PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons via 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R activation that contributes to open the gate for transmission of innocuous mechanical inputs to superficial SDH/MDH pain circuitry. Preventing 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-induced structural plasticity in PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons might represent new avenues for the specific treatment of inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inflammatory or neuropathic pain syndromes are characterized by pain hypersensitivity such as mechanical allodynia (pain induced by innocuous mechanical stimuli). It is generally assumed that mechanisms underlying mechanical allodynia, because they are rapid, must operate at only the level of functional reorganization of spinal or medullary dorsal horn (MDH) circuits. We discovered that facial inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia is associated with rapid and strong structural remodeling of specifically interneurons expressing the  isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) within MDH inner lamina II. Moreover, we elucidated a 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor to PKC/ERK1/2 pathway leading to the behavioral allodynia and correlated morphological changes in PKC interneurons. Therefore, descending 5-HT sensitize PKC interneurons, a putative &quot;gate&quot; in allodynia circuits, via 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-induced structural reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in Brainstem Pain Modulation Circuitry Function over the Migraine Cycle</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10479?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10479?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neural mechanism responsible for migraine remains unclear. While an external trigger has been proposed to initiate a migraine, it has also been proposed that changes in brainstem function are critical for migraine headache initiation and maintenance. Although the idea of altered brainstem function has some indirect support, no study has directly measured brainstem pain modulation circuitry function in migraineurs particularly immediately before a migraine. In male and female humans, we performed fMRI in 31 controls and 31 migraineurs at various times in their migraine cycle. We measured brainstem function during noxious orofacial stimulation and assessed resting-state functional connectivity. First, we found that, in individual migraineurs, pain sensitivity increased over the interictal period but then dramatically decreased immediately before a migraine. Second, despite overall similar pain intensity ratings between groups, in the period immediately before a migraine, compared with controls and other migraine phases, migraineurs displayed greater activation in the spinal trigeminal nucleus during noxious orofacial stimulation and reduced functional connectivity of this region with the rostral ventromedial medulla. Additionally, during the interictal phase, migraineurs displayed reduced activation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter and enhanced periaqueductal gray connectivity with the rostral ventromedial medulla. These data support the hypothesis that brainstem sensitivity fluctuates throughout the migraine cycle. However, in contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, our data suggest that, immediately before a migraine attack, endogenous analgesic mechanisms are enhanced and incoming noxious inputs are less likely to reach higher brain centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been hypothesized that alterations in brainstem function are critical for the generation of migraine. In particular, modulation of orofacial pain pathways by brainstem circuits alters the propensity of external triggers or ongoing spontaneous activity to evoke a migraine attack. We sought to obtain empirical evidence to support this theory. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that pain sensitivity decreased immediately before a migraine, and this was coupled with increased sensitivity of the spinal trigeminal nucleus to noxious stimuli. We also found that resting connectivity within endogenous pain modulation circuitry alters across the migraine cycle. These changes may reflect enhanced and diminished neural tone states proposed to be critical for the generation of a migraine and underlie cyclic fluctuations in migraine brainstem sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Loss of Thin Spines in Area 7a of the Primate Intraparietal Sulcus Predicts Age-Related Working Memory Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10467?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10467?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brodmann area 7a of the parietal cortex is active during working memory tasks in humans and nonhuman primates, but the composition and density of dendritic spines in area 7a and their relevance both to working memory and cognitive aging remain unexplored. Aged monkeys have impaired working memory, and we have previously shown that this age-induced cognitive impairment is partially mediated by a loss of thin spines in prefrontal cortex area 46, a critical area for working memory. Because area 46 is reciprocally connected with area 7a of the parietal cortex and 7a mediates visual attention integration, we hypothesized that thin spine density in area 7a would correlate with working memory performance as well. To investigate the synaptic profile of area 7a and its relevance to working memory and cognitive aging, we investigated differences in spine type and density in layer III pyramidal cells of area 7a in young and aged, male and female rhesus macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) that were cognitively assessed using the delayed response test of working memory. Area 7a shows age-related loss of thin spines, and thin spine density positively correlates with delayed response performance in aged monkeys. In contrast, these cells show no age-related changes in dendritic length or branching. These changes mirror age-related changes in area 46 but are distinct from other neocortical regions, such as V1. These findings support our hypothesis that cognitive aging is driven primarily by synaptic changes, and more specifically by changes in thin spines, in key association areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study advances our understanding of cognitive aging by demonstrating the relevance of area 7a thin spines to working memory performance. This study is the first to look at cognitive aging in the intraparietal sulcus, and also the first to report spine or dendritic measures for area 7a in either young adult or aged nonhuman primates. These results contribute to the hypothesis that thin spines support working memory performance and confirm our prior observation that cognitive aging is driven by synaptic changes rather than changes in dendritic morphology or neuron death. Importantly, these data show that age-related working memory changes are not limited to disruptions of the prefrontal cortex but also include an association region heavily interconnected with prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Retinoic Acid Receptor RAR{alpha}-Dependent Synaptic Signaling Mediates Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity at the Inhibitory Synapses of Mouse Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10454?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a synaptic mechanism through which the nervous system adjusts synaptic excitation and inhibition to maintain network stability. Retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor RARα have been established as critical mediators of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies reveal that RA signaling enhances excitatory synaptic strength and decreases inhibitory synaptic strength. However, it is unclear whether RA-mediated homeostatic synaptic plasticity occurs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and if so, whether it operates at specific types of synapses. Here, we examine the impact of RA/RARα signaling in the monocular zone of primary visual cortex (V1m) in mice of either sex. Exogenous RA treatment in acute cortical slices resulted in a reduction in mIPSCs of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, an effect mimicked by visual deprivation induced by binocular enucleation in postcritical period animals. Postnatal deletion of RARα blocked RA's effect on mIPSCs. Cell type-specific deletion of RARα revealed that RA acted specifically on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. RARα deletion in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons blocked visual deprivation-induced changes in mIPSCs, demonstrating the critical involvement of RA signaling in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, visual deprivation- or RA-induced downregulation of synaptic inhibition was absent in the visual cortical circuit of constitutive and PV-specific &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, strongly suggesting a functional interaction between fragile X mental retardation protein and RA signaling pathways. Together, our results demonstrate that RA/RARα signaling acts as a key component for homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission at the inhibitory synapses of the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies established that retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor RARα play key roles in homeostatic synaptic plasticity, a mechanism by which synaptic excitation/inhibition balance and network stability are maintained. However, whether synaptic RA signaling operates &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains undetermined. Here, using a conditional RARα KO mouse and cell type-specific Cre-driver lines, we showed that RARα signaling in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is crucial for visual deprivation-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses in visual cortical circuits. Importantly, this form of synaptic plasticity is absent when fragile X mental retardation protein is selectively deleted in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, suggesting a functional connection between RARα and fragile X mental retardation protein signaling pathways &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, dysfunction of RA-dependent homeostatic plasticity may contribute to cortical circuit abnormalities in fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Presynaptic mGluRs Control the Duration of Endocannabinoid-Mediated DSI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10444?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10444?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABA synapses in the brain undergo depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) that requires activation of presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). The brevity of DSI, lasting ~1 min in most brain regions, has been ascribed to the transient production of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Here, we propose that the duration of DSI is controlled by heterologous interactions between presynaptic mGluRs and CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. By examining GABA synapses on parvocellular corticotropin-releasing hormone-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of male and female mice, we show that DSI decays quickly in experimental conditions in which both GABA and glutamate are released from adjacent nerve terminals. Pharmacological inhibition of group I mGluRs prolongs DSI, whereas prior activation of mGluRs inhibits DSI, collectively suggesting that group I mGluRs quench presynaptic CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling. When photostimulation of genetically identified terminals is used to release only GABA, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent DSI persists for many minutes. Under the same conditions, activation of group I mGluRs reestablishes classical, transient DSI. The long-lasting DSI observed when GABA synapses are independently recruited functionally uncouples inhibitory input to PVN neurons. These observations suggest that heterologous interactions between mGluRs and CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs control the temporal window of DSI at GABA synapses, providing evidence for a powerful new way to affect functional circuit connectivity in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Postsynaptic depolarization liberates endocannabinoids, resulting in a rapid and transient decrease in release probability at GABA synapses. We discovered that mGluRs control the duration of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), most likely through heterologous desensitization of cannabinoid type 1 receptors by presynaptic mGluR&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. By shortening the duration of DSI, mGluRs control the temporal window for retrograde signaling at GABA synapses. Physiological or pathological changes that affect glutamate spillover may profoundly affect network excitability by shifting the duration of cannabinoid inhibition at GABA synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Specifying a Causal Role for Angular Gyrus in Autobiographical Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10438?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10438?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Considerable recent evidence indicates that angular gyrus dysfunction in humans does not result in amnesia, but does impair a number of aspects of episodic memory. Patients with parietal lobe lesions have been reported to exhibit a deficit when freely recalling autobiographical events from their pasts, but can remember details of the events when recall is cued by specific questions. In apparent contradiction, inhibitory brain stimulation targeting angular gyrus in healthy volunteers has been found to have no effect on free recall or cued recall of word pairs. The present study sought to resolve this inconsistency by testing free and cued recall of both autobiographical memories and word-pair memories in the same healthy male and female human participants following continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of angular gyrus and a vertex control location. Angular gyrus cTBS resulted in a selective reduction in the free recall, but not cued recall, of autobiographical memories, whereas free and cued recall of word-pair memories were unaffected. Additionally, participants reported fewer autobiographical episodes as being experienced from a first-person perspective following angular gyrus cTBS. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that a function of angular gyrus within the network of brain regions responsible for episodic recollection is to integrate memory features within an egocentric framework into the kind of first-person perspective representation that enables the subjective experience of remembering events from our personal pasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In seeking to understand the role played by the angular gyrus region of parietal cortex in human memory, interpreting the often conflicting findings from neuroimaging and neuropsychology studies has been hampered by differences in anatomical specificity and localization between methods. In the present study, we address these limitations using continuous theta burst stimulation in healthy volunteers to disrupt function of angular gyrus and a vertex control region. With this method, we adjudicate between two competing theories of parietal lobe function, finding evidence that is inconsistent with an attentional role for angular gyrus in memory, supporting instead an account in terms of integrating memory features within an egocentric framework into a first-person perspective representation that enables the subjective experience of remembering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection Alters Olfaction Before Hearing Deterioration In Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10424?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10424?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected newborns are at high risk of developing sensorineural handicaps such as hearing loss, requiring extensive follow-up. However, early prognostic tools for auditory damage in children are not yet available. In the fetus, CMV infection leads to early olfactory bulb (OB) damage, suggesting that olfaction might represent a valuable prognosis for neurological outcome of this viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; CMV inoculation causes fetal infection and growth retardation in mice of both sexes. It disrupts OB normal development, leading to disproportionate OB cell layers and rapid major olfactory deficits. Olfaction is impaired as early as day 6 after birth in both sexes, long before the emergence of auditory deficits. Olfactometry in males reveals a long-lasting alteration in olfactory perception and discrimination, particularly in binary mixtures of monomolecular odorants. Although sensory inputs to the OB remain unchanged, hallmarks of autophagy are increased in the OB of 3-postnatal week-old mice, leading to local neuroinflammation and loss of neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin. At the cellular level, we found CMV-infected cells and an increased number of apoptotic cells scattered throughout the OB layers, whereas cell proliferation in the neurogenic subventricular zone was decreased. These cellular observations were long-lasting, persisting up to 16 weeks after birth in both males and females and thus providing a mechanism supporting olfactory loss. Despite obvious differences in neurogenesis between human and mouse, these findings offer new strategies aimed at early detection of neurological dysfunctions caused by congenital infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In developed countries, congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected newborns are at high risk of developing sensory handicaps such as hearing loss, thus requiring prolonged follow-up. In this study, we describe for the first time the functional impact of congenital CMV infection on the olfactory system and its associated sense of smell. We demonstrate that a mouse model of congenital CMV infection shows defects in olfactory bulb (OB) normal development and pronounced olfactory deficits affecting acuity and discrimination of odorants. These major olfactory deficits occur long before the emergence of auditory deficits through the upregulation of OB autophagy inducing local neuroinflammation and altered neuron content. Our findings provide new opportunities for designing olfactory means to monitor the possible neurological outcome during congenital CMV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FABP3 in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex Modulates the Methylation Status of the Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase67 Promoter Region</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10411?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential for brain development and function. Increasing evidence has shown that an imbalance of PUFAs is associated with various human psychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), cellular chaperones of PUFAs, are involved in PUFA intracellular trafficking, signal transduction, and gene transcription. In this study, we show that FABP3 is strongly expressed in the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons of the male mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is a component of the limbic cortex and is important for the coordination of cognitive and emotional behaviors. Interestingly, &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO male mice show an increase in the expression of the gene encoding the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (&lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt;) in the ACC. In the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter methylation and the binding of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter are significantly decreased compared with those in WT mice. The abnormal cognitive and emotional behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice are restored by methionine administration. Notably, methionine administration normalizes &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter methylation and its mRNA expression in the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. These findings demonstrate that FABP3 is involved in the control of DNA methylation of the &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter and activation of GABAergic neurons in the ACC, thus suggesting the importance of PUFA homeostasis in the ACC for cognitive and emotional behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ACC is important for emotional and cognitive processing. However, the mechanisms underlying its involvement in the control of behavioral responses are largely unknown. We show the following new observations: (1) FABP3, a PUFA cellular chaperone, is exclusively expressed in GABAergic interneurons in the ACC; (2) an increase in &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; expression is detected in the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice; (3) the &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter is hypomethylated and the binding of transcriptional repressor complexes is decreased in the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice; and (4) elevated &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; expression and abnormal behaviors seen in &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice are mostly recovered by methionine treatment. These suggest that FABP3 regulates GABA synthesis through transcriptional regulation of &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis: A Coming-of-Age Story</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10401?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What has become standard textbook knowledge over the last decade was a hotly debated matter a decade earlier: the proposition that new neurons are generated in the adult mammalian CNS. The early discovery by Altman and colleagues in the 1960s was vulnerable to criticism due to the lack of technical strategies for unequivocal demonstration, quantification, and physiological analysis of newly generated neurons in adult brain tissue. After several technological advancements had been made in the field, we published a paper in 1996 describing the generation of new neurons in the adult rat brain and the decline of hippocampal neurogenesis during aging. The paper coincided with the publication of several other studies that together established neurogenesis as a cellular mechanism in the adult mammalian brain. In this &lt;i&gt;Progressions&lt;/i&gt; article, which is by no means a comprehensive review, we recount our personal view of the initial setting that led to our study and we discuss some of its implications and developments that followed. We also address questions that remain regarding the regulation and function of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain, in particular the existence of neurogenesis in the adult human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Evidences of Hierarchical Cognitive Control during Haptic Processing: An fMRI Study</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with our immediate surroundings requires constant manipulation of objects. Dexterous manipulation depends on comparison between actual and predicted sensory input, with these predictions calculated by means of lower- and higher-order corollary discharge signals. However, there is still scarce knowledge about the hierarchy in the neural architecture supporting haptic monitoring during manipulation. The present study aimed to assess this issue focusing on the cross talk between lower-order sensory and higher-order associative regions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans during a haptic discrimination task in which participants had to judge whether a touched shape or texture corresponded to an expected stimulus whose name was previously presented. Specialized haptic regions identified with an independent localizer task did not differ between expected and unexpected conditions, suggesting their lack of involvement in tactile monitoring. When presented stimuli did not match previous expectations, the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), middle temporal, and medial prefrontal cortices were activated regardless of the nature of the haptic mismatch (shape/texture). The left primary somatosensory area (SI) responded differently to unexpected shapes and textures in line with a specialized detection of haptic mismatch. Importantly, connectivity analyses revealed that the left SMG and SI were more functionally coupled during unexpected trials, emphasizing their interaction. The results point for the first time to a hierarchical organization in the neural substrates underlying haptic monitoring during manipulation with the SMG as a higher-order hub comparing actual and predicted somatosensory input, and SI as a lower-order site involved in the detection of more specialized haptic mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Tight Upper Bound on Mutual Information. (arXiv:1812.01475v1 [cs.IT])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We derive a tight lower bound on equivocation (conditional entropy), or
equivalently a tight upper bound on mutual information between a signal
variable and channel outputs. The bound is in terms of the joint distribution
of the signals and maximum a posteriori decodes (most probable signals given
channel output). As part of our derivation, we describe the key properties of
the distribution of signals, channel outputs and decodes, that minimizes
equivocation and maximizes mutual information. This work addresses a problem in
data analysis, where mutual information between signals and decodes is
sometimes used to lower bound the mutual information between signals and
channel outputs. Our result provides a corresponding upper bound.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Shift in brain-state induced by tDCS: an EEG study. (arXiv:1812.01342v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01342</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is known to have a modulatory
effect on neural tissue and that it is polarity specific. It is also shown that
tDCS demonstrated the lasting effect in therapeutic applications. The main aim
of the study was to examine the effects of tDCS on cortical dynamics by
analyzing EEG recordings. We applied here measures taken from Recurrence
Quantification Analysis, Mean State Shift (MSS) and State Variance (SV) which
were previously used to detect changes in brain-state dynamics after TMS. The
studied cohort comprised of 16 healthy subjects; all subjects received anodal
and cathodal tDCS, which were given in two separate sessions on the same day.
The EEG was recorded from 10 electrodes, positioned over left motor cortex and
mirroring right cortex corresponding to 10/20 standard. From three traces of
recordings (pre, post1 and post2/before the stimulation, immediately after and
30min after tDCS) we extracted five different intervals (T1-T5) comprising of
500 samples. After calculating MSS and SV on those epochs and statistical
testing for a significant difference, we applied Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) on the same time series to check whether the data are separable. The
results show that tDCS exert polarity specific effects on the MSS as shown by
significantly lower MSS values after cathodal stimulation compared to anodal
stimulation. Cathodal stimulation affected the SV, as compared to anodal
stimulation, which did not lead to detectable changes. We are offering here for
the first time an informative PCA visualization of a time-effect of a tDCS
stimulation on brain state shift. Further research is needed to elucidate for
how long that change can be detected and what neurobiological changes are
introduced by that phenomena.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Dynamic Shift of Neuron Excitability Observed with Enveloped High Frequency Stimulation. (arXiv:1812.01179v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01179</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01179</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability is known to be affected by transcranial electrical
stimulation. However, due to the existence of both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons in the cortex, the mechanism of neuronal excitability shift is still
not clear. Here, we study electrical stimulation disturbance on neuronal
excitability in the neuromuscular system on an acute rat model. We design a
special stimulation waveform of enveloped high frequency stimulation (EHFS).
With modeling and in vivo measurements, EHFS is confirmed to synchronize the
neuronal recruitment at the positive and negative electrode. This unique
synchronization property of EHFS amplifies the electrical stimulation
disturbance on neuronal excitability, to enable the macroscopic observations of
large increase and decrease of force output. By eliminating the complicated
inhibitory interneuron effects in the cortex, our observations on the
neuromuscular system supports the argument that electrical stimulation
dynamically shifts neuronal excitability, by inducing depolarization during
anodal stimulation and hyperpolarization during cathodal stimulation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Numerical Frequency Transference Analysis of a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron. (arXiv:1812.01084v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01084</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01084</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work reports a transfer function-based approach to characterizing the
operation of single neuronal cells in terms of the instantaneous frequency of
the input and output signals. We adopt the leaky integrate-and-fire model. The
transfer function is obtained by performing successive numeric-computational
simulations and statistical regressions. Several interesting results are
reported, including the identification of linearity in the transfer functions,
as well as the identification of regions in the parameter space characterized
by sharper transfer functions.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The empirical characteristics of human pattern vision defy theoretically-driven expectations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006585</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Neri&lt;/p&gt;

Contrast is the most fundamental property of images. Consequently, any comprehensive model of biological vision must incorporate this attribute and provide a veritable description of its impact on visual perception. Current theoretical and computational models predict that vision should modify its characteristics at low contrast: for example, it should become broader (more lowpass) to protect from noise, as often demonstrated by individual neurons. We find that the opposite is true for human discrimination of elementary image elements: vision becomes sharper, not broader, as contrast approaches threshold levels. Furthermore, it suffers from increased internal variability at low contrast and it transitions from a surprisingly linear regime at high contrast to a markedly nonlinear processing mode in the low-contrast range. These characteristics are hard-wired in that they happen on a single trial without memory or expectation. Overall, the empirical results urge caution when attempting to interpret human vision from the standpoint of optimality and related theoretical constructs. Direct measurements of this phenomenon indicate that the actual constraints derive from intrinsic architectural features, such as the co-existence of complex-cell-like and simple-cell-like components. Small circuits built around these elements can indeed account for the empirical results, but do not appear to operate in a manner that conforms to optimality even approximately. More generally, our results provide a compelling demonstration of how far we still are from securing an adequate computational account of the most basic operations carried out by human vision.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p892OX1e4bY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Regulation of harvester ant foraging as a closed-loop excitable system</title>

Ant colonies regulate activity in response to changing conditions without using centralized control. Desert harvester ant colonies forage for seeds, and regulate foraging to manage a tradeoff between spending and obtaining water. Foragers lose water while outside in the dry air, but ants obtain water by metabolizing the fats in the seeds they eat. Previous work shows that the rate at which an outgoing forager leaves the nest depends on its recent rate of brief antennal contacts with incoming foragers carrying food. We examine how this process can yield foraging rates that are robust to uncertainty and responsive to temperature and humidity across minute-to-hour timescales. To explore possible mechanisms, we develop a low-dimensional analytical model with a small number of parameters that captures observed foraging behavior. The model uses excitability dynamics to represent response to interactions inside the nest and a random delay distribution to represent foraging time outside the nest. We show how feedback from outgoing foragers returning to the nest stabilizes the incoming and outgoing foraging rates to a common value determined by the volatility of available foragers. The model exhibits a critical volatility above which there is sustained foraging at a constant rate and below which foraging stops. To explain how foraging rates adjust to temperature and humidity, we propose that foragers modify their volatility after they leave the nest and become exposed to the environment. Our study highlights the importance of feedback in the regulation of foraging activity and shows how modulation of volatility can explain how foraging activity responds to conditions and varies across colonies. Our model elucidates the role of feedback across many timescales in collective behavior, and may be generalized to other systems driven by excitable dynamics, such as neuronal networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QFEh9jEk6cU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Development of GABAergic Inputs Is Not Altered in Early Maturation of Adult Born Dentate Granule Neurons in Fragile X Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that is correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Here, we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation; however, this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: State-Dependent Modulation of Locomotion by GABAergic Spinal Sensory Neurons. (arXiv:1812.00625v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) constitutes an interface through which chemical
cues can reach and modulate the activity of neurons located at the epithelial
boundary within the entire nervous system. Here, we investigate the role and
functional connectivity of a class of GABAergic sensory neurons contacting the
CSF in the vertebrate spinal cord and referred to as CSF-cNs. The remote
activation of CSF-cNs was shown to trigger delayed slow locomotion in the
zebrafish larva, suggesting that these cells modulate components of locomotor
central pattern generators (CPGs). Combining anatomy, electrophysiology, and
optogenetics in vivo, we show that CSF-cNs form active GABAergic synapses onto
V0-v glutamatergic interneurons, an essential component of locomotor CPGs. We
confirmed that activating CSF-cNs at rest induced delayed slow locomotion in
the fictive preparation. In contrast, the activation of CSF-cNs promptly
inhibited ongoing slow locomotion. Moreover, selective activation of rostral
CSF-cNs during ongoing activity disrupted rostrocaudal propagation of
descending excitation along the spinal cord, indicating that CSF-cNs primarily
act at the premotor level. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a spinal
GABAergic sensory neuron can tune the excitability of locomotor CPGs in a
state-dependent manner by projecting onto essential components of the
excitatory premotor pool.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Finite Element Modeling (FEM) has been widely used to model the electric
field distribution, to study the interaction between stimulation electrodes and
neural tissue. However, due to the insufficient computational capability to
represent neural tissue down to an atom-level, the existing FEM fails to model
the real electric field that is perpendicular to neuron membrane to initiate an
action potential. Thus, to reveal the real electrode-tissue interactions, we
developed a circuit to model transmembrane voltage waveforms. Here, we show a
distributed-parameter circuit model to systematically study how
electrode-tissue interaction is affected by electrode position, input current
waveform, and biological structures in the neuromuscular system. Our model
explains and predicts various phenomena in neuromuscular stimulation, guides
new stimulation electrode and method design, and more importantly, facilitates
a fundamental understanding of the physical process during electrode-tissue
interaction. In our model, myelin is assumed to be inductive. The voltage
waveform resonance caused by this inductive myelin accounts for the much lower
stimulation threshold to activate motoneurons than muscle fibers, which is
observed with in vivo measurements. These findings confirmed the feasibility of
studying electrode-tissue interaction using a proper distributed-parameter
circuit. Our current application on the neuromuscular system also raises the
possibility that this distributed-parameter circuit model could potentially be
applied to study other neural tissues, including the Peripheral Nervous System
(PNS) and the Central Nervous System (CNS).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Interpreting Encoding and Decoding Models. (arXiv:1812.00278v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Encoding and decoding models are widely used in systems, cognitive, and
computational neuroscience to make sense of brain-activity data. However, the
interpretation of their results requires care. Decoding models can help reveal
whether particular information is present in a brain region in a format the
decoder can exploit. Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about
representational spaces. In the context of sensory systems, encoding models
enable us to test and compare brain-computational models, and thus directly
constrain computational theory. Encoding and decoding models typically include
fitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear
combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the
contribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a
decoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a
decoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor
variables or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or
penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are
evaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct
interpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to
new response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same
population, or to stimuli from a different population). Significant decoding or
encoding performance of a single model (at whatever level of generality) does
not provide strong constraints for theory. Many models must be tested and
inferentially compared for analyses to drive theoretical progress.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: True Contextuality in a Psychophysical Experiment. (arXiv:1812.00105v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00105</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent crowdsourcing experiments have shown that true contextuality of the
kind found in quantum mechanics can also be present in human behavior. In these
experiments simple human choices were aggregated over large numbers of
respondents, with each respondent dealing with a single context (set of
questions asked). In this paper we present experimental evidence of
contextuality in individual human behavior, in a psychophysical experiment with
repeated presentations of visual stimuli in randomly varying contexts
(arrangements of stimuli). The analysis is based on the
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory whose relevant aspects are reviewed in
the paper. CbD allows one to detect contextuality in the presence of direct
influences, i.e., when responses to the same stimuli have different
distributions in different contexts. The experiment presented is also the first
one in which contextuality is demonstrated for responses that are not
dichotomous, with five options to choose among. CbD requires that random
variables representing such responses be dichotomized before they are subjected
to contextuality analysis. A theorem says that a system consisting of all
possible dichotomizations of responses has to be contextual if these responses
violate a certain condition, called nominal dominance. In our experiment
nominal dominance was violated in all data sets, with very high statistical
reliability established by bootstrapping.

There is growing evidence that population-level brain activity is often organized into propagating waves that are structured in both space and time. Such spatiotemporal patterns have been linked to brain function and observed across multiple recording methodologies and scales. The ability to detect and analyze these patterns is thus essential for understanding the working mechanisms of neural circuits. Here we present a mathematical and computational framework for the identification and analysis of multiple classes of wave patterns in neural population-level recordings. By drawing a conceptual link between spatiotemporal patterns found in the brain and coherent structures such as vortices found in turbulent flows, we introduce velocity vector fields to characterize neural population activity. These vector fields are calculated for both phase and amplitude of oscillatory neural signals by adapting optical flow estimation methods from the field of computer vision. Based on these velocity vector fields, we then introduce order parameters and critical point analysis to detect and characterize a diverse range of propagating wave patterns, including planar waves, sources, sinks, spiral waves, and saddle patterns. We also introduce a novel vector field decomposition method that extracts the dominant spatiotemporal structures in a recording. This enables neural data to be represented by the activity of a small number of independent spatiotemporal modes, providing an alternative to existing dimensionality reduction techniques which separate space and time components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the framework and toolbox with simulated data, local field potentials from marmoset visual cortex and optical voltage recordings from whole mouse cortex, and we show that pattern dynamics are non-random and are modulated by the presence of visual stimuli. These methods are implemented in a MATLAB toolbox, which is freely available under an open-source licensing agreement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_y4dI44JGZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: TAMMiCol: Tool for analysis of the morphology of microbial colonies</title>

Many microbes are studied by examining colony morphology via two-dimensional top-down images. The quantification of such images typically requires each pixel to be labelled as belonging to either the colony or background, producing a binary image. While this may be achieved manually for a single colony, this process is infeasible for large datasets containing thousands of images. The software Tool for Analysis of the Morphology of Microbial Colonies (TAMMiCol) has been developed to efficiently and automatically convert colony images to binary. TAMMiCol exploits the structure of the images to choose a thresholding tolerance and produce a binary image of the colony. The images produced are shown to compare favourably with images processed manually, while TAMMiCol is shown to outperform standard segmentation methods. Multiple images may be imported together for batch processing, while the binary data may be exported as a CSV or MATLAB MAT file for quantification, or analysed using statistics built into the software. Using the in-built statistics, it is found that images produced by TAMMiCol yield values close to those computed from binary images processed manually. Analysis of a new large dataset using TAMMiCol shows that colonies of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; reach a maximum level of filamentous growth once the concentration of ammonium sulfate is reduced to 200 μM. TAMMiCol is accessed through a graphical user interface, making it easy to use for those without specialist knowledge of image processing, statistical methods or coding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aOVC22Kfiw0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Performance of convolutional neural networks for identification of bacteria in 3D microscopy datasets</title>

Three-dimensional microscopy is increasingly prevalent in biology due to the development of techniques such as multiphoton, spinning disk confocal, and light sheet fluorescence microscopies. These methods enable unprecedented studies of life at the microscale, but bring with them larger and more complex datasets. New image processing techniques are therefore called for to analyze the resulting images in an accurate and efficient manner. Convolutional neural networks are becoming the standard for classification of objects within images due to their accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional techniques. Their application to data derived from 3D imaging, however, is relatively new and has mostly been in areas of magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography. It remains unclear, for images of discrete cells in variable backgrounds as are commonly encountered in fluorescence microscopy, whether convolutional neural networks provide sufficient performance to warrant their adoption, especially given the challenges of human comprehension of their classification criteria and their requirements of large training datasets. We therefore applied a 3D convolutional neural network to distinguish bacteria and non-bacterial objects in 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy images of larval zebrafish intestines. We find that the neural network is as accurate as human experts, outperforms random forest and support vector machine classifiers, and generalizes well to a different bacterial species through the use of transfer learning. We also discuss network design considerations, and describe the dependence of accuracy on dataset size and data augmentation. We provide source code, labeled data, and descriptions of our analysis pipeline to facilitate adoption of convolutional neural network analysis for three-dimensional microscopy data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yuhOvXjwIEI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Experiments in cognitive neuroscience typically study a psychological process via controlled manipulations, reducing behavior to one of its components. Such reductionism can easily lead to paradigm-bound theories. Predictive models can generalize brain-mind associations to arbitrary new tasks and stimuli. We argue that they are needed to broaden theories beyond specific paradigms. Predicting behavior from neural activity can support robust reverse inference, isolating brain structures that support particular mental processes. The converse prediction enables modeling brain responses as a function of a complete description of the task, rather than building on oppositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Spinal cord injury in rats disrupts the circadian system</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) perturbs many physiological systems. The circadian system helps maintain homeostasis throughout the body by synchronizing physiological and behavioural functions to predictable daily events. Whether disruption of these coordinated daily rhythms contributes to SCI-associated pathology remains under-studied. Here, we hypothesized that SCI in rats would dysregulate several prominent circadian outputs including glucocorticoids, core temperature, activity, neuroinflammation, and circadian gene networks. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to clinically relevant thoracic (T-) 9 moderate contusion SCI (or laminectomy sham surgery). Diurnal measures – including rhythms of plasma corticosterone (CORT), body temperature and activity (using small implanted transmitters), and intraspinal circadian and inflammatory gene expression – were studied prior to and post-surgery. SCI caused overall increases and disrupted rhythms of the major rodent glucocorticoid, CORT. Pre-surgery and sham rats displayed expected rhythms in body temperature and activity, whereas rats with SCI had blunted daily rhythms in body temperature and activity. In parallel, SCI disrupted intraspinal rhythms of circadian clock gene expression. Circadian clock genes can act as transcriptional regulators of inflammatory pathways. Indeed, SCI rats also showed dysregulated rhythms in inflammatory gene expression in both the epicenter and distal spinal cord. Our data show that moderate SCI in rats causes wide-ranging diurnal rhythm dysfunction, which is severe at acute time points, and gradually recovers over time. Normalizing post-SCI diurnal rhythms could enhance recovery of homeostasis and quality-of-life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause physiologic dysfunction throughout the body. Internal physiologic function is typically synchronized with the environment through the circadian system. Despite the crucial roles of the spinal cord and the circadian system in optimizing whole-body function, it remains unclear whether SCI alters diurnal rhythms. Here, we hypothesized that SCI would disrupt key circadian output and feedback mechanisms. Moderate SCI in rats caused widespread disruption of diurnal measures – including glucocorticoids, body temperature, locomotor activity, and intraspinal clock and inflammatory gene expression. We identify the circadian system as a novel potential target for SCI therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that ovarian cycles stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is insidious and begins several decades before clinical symptoms. For women, this means that pathophysiological changes could occur in the brain during the reproductive life-stage – prior to the cessation of ovarian function. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. We show that ovarian cycles are altered in a mouse model of AD and that ovarian cycle stage contributes to AD-related network and cognitive impairments. Investigating network activity, cognition, seizures, and other manifestations of brain function across the reproductive cycle stages in cycling women could reveal differential patterns in the brain at risk for AD compared to normal aging – and potentially open the door for preventative therapies and early treatment in women at risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution and, in combination with tissue clearing methods, is often employed to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the intact mouse brain. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects, always present to some extent even in extremely well optically cleared samples, cause stripe artifacts, which, in the best case, severely affect image homogeneity and, in the worst case, completely obscure features of interest. Here, demonstrating two example applications in intact optically cleared mouse brains, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data for the brain-wide morphology of neuronal and vascular networks. We found that a third of the imaged volume of the brain was affected by strong striated image intensity inhomogeneity and, furthermore, a significant amount of information content lost with Gaussian illumination was accessible when interrogated with Bessel beams. In conclusion, Bessel beams produce high-fidelity structural data of improved image homogeneity and might significantly relax demands placed on the automated tools to count, trace, or segment fluorescent features of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dementia and especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common causes
of cognitive decline in elderly people. A spread of the above mentioned mental
health problems in aging societies is causing a significant medical and
economic burden in many countries around the world. According to a recent World
Health Organization (WHO) report, it is approximated that currently, worldwide,
about 47 million people live with a dementia spectrum of neurocognitive
disorders. This number is expected to triple by 2050, which calls for possible
application of AI-based technologies to support an early screening for
preventive interventions and a subsequent mental wellbeing monitoring as well
as maintenance with so-called digital-pharma or beyond a pill therapeutical
approaches. This paper discusses our attempt and preliminary results of
brainwave (EEG) techniques to develop digital biomarkers for dementia progress
detection and monitoring. We present an information geometry-based
classification approach for automatic EEG-derived event related responses
(ERPs) discrimination of low versus high task-load auditory or tactile stimuli
recognition, of which amplitude and latency variabilities are similar to those
in dementia. The discussed approach is a step forward to develop AI, and
especially machine learning (ML) approaches, for the subsequent application to
mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD diagnostics.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Effects of COMT Polymorphism on Cortical Thickness and Surface Area Abnormalities in Children with ADHD</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The catechol-O-methyltransferase (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt;) gene is associated with frontal cortex development and the pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, how the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; gene impacts brain structure and behavior in ADHD remains unknown. In the present study, we identify the effect of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; on cortical thickness and surface area in children with ADHD and children with typically developing (TD) using a machine learning approach. In a sample of 39 children with ADHD and 34 age- and IQ-matched TD children, we found that cortical thickness and surface area differences were predominantly observed in the frontal cortex. Furthermore, a path analysis revealed that a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype affected abnormal development of the frontal cortex in terms of both cortical thickness and surface area and was associated with working memory changes in children with ADHD. Our study confirms that the role of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; in ADHD is not restricted to the development of behavior but may also affect the cortical thickness and surface area. Thus, our findings may help to improve the understanding of the neuroanatomic basis for the relationship between the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype and ADHD pathogenesis.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Cerebellar granule cells are a popular target of neuroanatomical hyperbole, being so small and so numerous. Early theorists proposed unique roles for this vast cell population, ideas that continue to be tested through contemporary approaches. In 2017, a cluster of empirical and theoretical papers offered a fresh and singular look into the functions of granule cells and the computational advantages of their idiosyncratic circuit organization.</description>

	<description>Locomotion is generated by intrinsically oscillating circuits in the spinal cord that are modulated by information from the brain and periphery. In their seminal 1987 publication, Buchanan and Grillner provided for the first time evidence for excitatory spinal neurons receiving inputs from descending commands and sensory afferents, and synapsing onto motoneurons and commissural inhibitory interneurons. These critical findings established the circuit model for central pattern generators incorporating excitatory interneurons’ role in the rhythm-production mechanism.</description>

	<description>The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly conserved signaling system regulating a range of developmental processes. A 1997 paper by Goodrich and colleagues provided major contributions to understanding the Hh pathway by mutating the gene encoding the Hh receptor, Patched, and thereby developing a mouse model for a human cancer predisposition syndrome, known as Gorlin syndrome. These studies provided one of the first genetically engineered mouse models for brain tumors.</description>

	<description>Across the animal kingdom, odors are known as potent stimuli that directly steer behavior. In 2007, Hitoshi Sakano and colleagues used the power of mouse genetics to manipulate the odor map in the olfactory bulb. Elegant behavioral, anatomical, and physiological analyses revealed an apparent dichotomy in how the brain interprets the odor map. Their work paved a way to think of behavioral contingencies as part of early olfactory processing, highlighting innate and learned pathways.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n = 5) or without rituximab (n = 2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1 or 2 doses of tocilizumab in 6 patients with a median interval of 3 days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, 2 patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson disease. Pathogenic mechanisms include phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, nonphysiological levodopa‐to‐dopamine conversion in serotonergic neurons, hyperactivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, and overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine‐releasing axons. Delay in initiating levodopa is no longer recommended, as dyskinesia development is a function of disease duration rather than cumulative levodopa exposure. We review current and in‐development treatments for peak‐dose dyskinesia but suggest that improvements in levodopa delivery alone may reduce its future prevalence.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Meningeal inflammation and cortical demyelination in acute multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25365?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical gray matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration, and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology at early stages of MS to better predict long‐term outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n = 12, median disease duration = 2 years), progressive MS (n = 21, disease duration = 25 years), non‐diseased controls (n = 11), and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n = 6) were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range = 1–48% of total cortical GM), and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microglia/macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions, and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‐like structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/macrophage activation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‐like structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss, and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Genome‐wide meta‐analysis identifies 3 novel loci associated with stroke</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25369?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We conducted a European‐only and transancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt; (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 2.2E‐8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.07) and variants in an intron of &lt;i&gt;COL4A1&lt;/i&gt; (rs9521634; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8E‐8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06) and near &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; (rs720470; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.1E‐9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.07) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using 2‐way analysis of variance with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in milliseconds, VS: 152.7 ± 7.9 vs M: 145.3 ± 9.8 vs C: 145.5 ± 9.4; &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 3.28; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and reduced N75–P100 amplitudes (in microvolts, VS: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs M: 12.5 ± 4.7 vs C: 10.8 ± 3.4; &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 3.16; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.051). Dunnett post hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Biallelic COLGALT1 variants are associated with cerebral small vessel disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25367?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25367?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. We validated the role of &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &amp;gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &amp;gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &amp;gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Vagus nerve stimulation modulates the cranial trigeminal autonomic reflex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25366?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25366?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026, η&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.030, η&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.614, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.023, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.030, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus.

	<description>The discovery of genetic forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has highlighted the importance of the autophagy/lysosomal and mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathways in disease pathogenesis. However, recently identified PD-linked genes, including DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1), have also highlighted disruptions in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) as a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the roles of other PD genes such as LRRK2, PRKN, and VPS35 in the regulation of SVE are beginning to emerge.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cilostazol decreases duration of spreading depolarization and spreading ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25361?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25361?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, angiographic vasospasm (aVS) has been thought to cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, successful treatment of aVS alone does not result in improved neurological outcome. Therefore, there may be other potential causes of poor neurological outcome, including spreading depolarization (SD). A recent study showed beneficial effects of cilostazol on DCI and neurological outcome. The present prospective clinical trial and experimental study focused on effects of cilostazol on SDs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty aSAH patients were treated with clip ligation and randomly assigned to a cilostazol (n = 23) or control group (n = 27). Effects of cilostazol on DCI, aVS, and SDs, measured with subdural electrodes, were examined. The effect of cilostazol on SD‐induced perfusion deficits (spreading ischemia) was assessed in an aSAH‐mimicking model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a trend for less DCI in the cilostazol group, but it did not reach our threshold for statistical significance (13.0% vs 40.0%, odds ratio = 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.059–1.192, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.084). However, the total SD‐induced depression duration per recording day (22.2 vs 30.2 minutes, β = −251.905, 95% CI = −488.458 to −15.356, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.043) and the occurrence of isoelectric SDs (0 vs 4 patients, β = −0.916, 95% CI = −1.746 to −0.085, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.037) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. In rats, cilostazol significantly shortened SD‐induced spreading ischemia compared to vehicle (Student &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; test, difference = 30.2, 95% CI = 5.3–55.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.020).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repair of the neurovascular response to SDs by cilostazol, as demonstrated in the aSAH‐mimicking model, may be a promising therapy to control DCI. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cortico-striatal cross-frequency coupling and gamma genesis disruptions in Huntingtons disease mouse and computational models</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Abnormal gamma band power across cortex and striatum is an important phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) in both patients and animal models, but neither the origin nor the functional relevance of this phenotype is well understood. Here, we analyzed local field potential (LFP) activity in freely behaving, symptomatic R6/2 and Q175 mouse models and corresponding wild-type (WT) controls. We focused on periods of quiet rest, which show strong gamma activity in HD mice. Simultaneous recording from motor cortex and its target area in dorsal striatum in the R6/2 model revealed exaggerated functional coupling over that observed in WT between the phase of delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) in cortex and striatum and striatal amplitude modulation of low gamma frequencies (25-55 Hz) (i.e. &quot;phase amplitude coupling&quot;), but no evidence that abnormal cortical activity alone can account for the increase in striatal gamma power. Both HD mouse models had stronger coupling of gamma amplitude to delta phase and more uni-modal phase distributions than their WT counterparts. To assess the possible role of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in these phenomena, we developed a computational model based on additional striatal recordings from Q175 mice. Changes in peak gamma frequency and power ratio were readily reproduced by our computational model, accounting for several experimental findings reported in the literature. Our results suggest that HD is characterized by both a reorganization of cortico-striatal drive and specific population changes related to intra-striatal synaptic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; In HD, functional impairments first impact movement (chorea, dyskinesia) and cognition (executive functions, abstract thinking). Neuronal dysfunction associated with deficits appear first in cerebral cortex and striatum, which displays abnormally strong power in the low gamma band (25-55 Hz). Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are a neuronal subtype putatively capable of forming networks that resonate at the gamma frequency. Here we show that FSI networks can implement an early routing bias for more abundant neuronal subtypes in striatum. Specifically, by analyzing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings from HD mice at rest when gamma is strong and using computational modeling, we identify coupling changes between cortex and striatum sufficient to generate periods of abnormal FSI network gamma in response to slow wave cortical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: N‐acetylcysteine targets 5 lipoxygenase‐derived, toxic lipids and can synergize with prostaglandin E2 to inhibit ferroptosis and improve outcomes following hemorrhagic stroke in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25356?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25356?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically approved thiol‐containing redox modulatory compound currently in trials for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although generically labeled as an “antioxidant,” poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5‐lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral‐gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAC prevented hemin‐induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate‐dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione‐dependent enzymes such as glutathione &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;‐transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular lipid peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic arachidonic acid products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia in Parkinson disease: Sleep matters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25360?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25360?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of clinical symptom changes during the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa therapy, while offering remarkable control of classical motor symptoms, causes abnormal involuntary movements as the disease progresses. This levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity. Because slow wave activity (SWA) of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep underlies adjustment of cortical excitability, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this physiological process and LID.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients at different stages of PD underwent whole‐night video polysomnography–high‐density electroencephalography (vPSG‐hdEEG), preceded by 1 week of actigraphy. To represent the broad spectrum of the disease, patients were divided into 3 groups by disease stage—(1) de novo (n = 9), (2) advanced (n = 13), and (3) dyskinetic (DYS; n = 14)—were compared to an age‐matched control group (n = 12). The SWA‐NREM content of the vPSG‐hdEEG was then temporally divided into 10 equal parts, from T1 to T10, and power and source analyses were performed. T2‐T3‐T4 were considered early sleep and were compared to T7‐T8‐T9, representing late sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that all groups, except the DYS group, manifested a clear‐cut SWA decrease between early and late sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrate a strong pathophysiological association between sleep and PD. Given that SWA may be a surrogate for synaptic strength, our data suggest that DYS patients do not have adequate synaptic downscaling. Further analysis is needed to determine the effect of drugs that can enhance cortical SWA in LID. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Serum soluble TREM2 as a biomarker for incident dementia: the Hisayama Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,349 Japanese community‐residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002‐2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all P for trend &amp;lt;0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR=2.03, 95% CI=1.39‐2.97, P&amp;lt;0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.02‐2.55, P=0.04 for AD; HR=2.85, 95% CI=1.35‐6.02, P=0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk‐factor subgroups (all P for heterogeneity &amp;gt;0.11).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Receptive Field Properties of Koniocellular On/Off Neurons in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of Marmoset Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10384?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10384?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The koniocellular (K) layers of the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus house a variety of visual receptive field types, not all of which have been fully characterized. Here we made single-cell recordings targeted to the K layers of diurnal New World monkeys (marmosets). A subset of recorded cells was excited by both increments and decrements of light intensity (on/off-cells). Histological reconstruction of the location of these cells confirmed that they are segregated to K layers; we therefore refer to these cells as K-on/off cells. The K-on/off cells show high contrast sensitivity, strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, and their response magnitude is strongly reduced by stimuli larger than the excitatory receptive field (silent suppressive surrounds). Stationary counterphase gratings evoke unmodulated spike rate increases or frequency-doubled responses in K-on/off cells; such responses are largely independent of grating spatial phase. The K-on/off cells are not orientation or direction selective. Some (but not all) properties of K-on/off cells are consistent with those of local-edge-detector/impressed-by-contrast cells reported in studies of cat retina and geniculate, and broad-thorny ganglion cells recorded in macaque monkey retina. The receptive field properties of K-on/off cells and their preferential location in the ventral K layers (K1 and K2) make them good candidates for the direct projection from geniculate to extrastriate cortical area MT/V5. If so, they could contribute to visual information processing in the dorsal (&quot;where&quot; or &quot;action&quot;) visual stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We characterize cells in an evolutionary ancient part of the visual pathway in primates. The cells are located in the lateral geniculate nucleus (the main visual afferent relay nucleus), in regions called koniocellular layers that are known to project to extrastriate visual areas as well as primary visual cortex. The cells show high contrast sensitivity and rapid, transient responses to light onset and offset. Their properties suggest they could contribute to visual processing in the dorsal (&quot;where&quot; or &quot;action&quot;) visual stream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cerebellar Role in Predictive Control of Eye Velocity Initiation and Termination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10371?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10371?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive motor control is essential to achieve rapid and precise motor action in all vertebrates. Visuomotor transformations have been a popular model system to study the underlying neural mechanisms, in particular, the role of the cerebellum in both predictive and gain adaptations. In all species, large-field visual motion produces an involuntary conjugate ocular movement facilitating gaze stabilization called the optokinetic response. Gain adaptation can be induced by prolonged optokinetic visual stimulation; and if the visual stimulation is temporally periodic, predictive behavior emerges. Two predictive timing components were identifiable in this behavior. The first was prediction of stimulus initiation (when to move) and the other was stimulus termination (when to stop). We designed visual training that allowed us to evaluate initiation and termination independently that included the recording of cerebellar activity followed by acute and chronic cerebellar removal in goldfish of both sexes. We found that initiation and termination predictions were present in the cerebellum and more robust than conflicting visual sensory signals. Each prediction could be acquired independently, and both the acquisition and maintenance of each component were cerebellar-dependent. Subsequent analysis of the neuronal connectivity strongly supports the hypothesis that the acquired eye velocity behaviors were dependent on feedforward velocity buildup signals from the brainstem, but the adaptive timing mechanism itself originates within the circuitry of the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Predictive and rapid motor control is essential in our daily life, such as in the playing of musical instruments or sports. The current work evaluates timing of a visuomotor behavior shown to be similar in humans as well as goldfish. Given the latter species' known brainstem cerebellar neuronal connectivity and experimental advantage, it was possible to demonstrate the cerebellum to be necessary for acquisition and maintenance of both the initiation and termination components of when to move and to stop. All evidence in this study points to the adaptive predictive control site to lie within the cerebellar circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Adenosine signaling though A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons show that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a GIRK-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adenosine is a potent modulator of all aspects of breathing including chemoreception at the level of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN); however, mechanisms by which adenosine regulates activity of RTN chemoreceptors is not known. Here, we show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits RTN neurons by activation of an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and by selective suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors. These results identify a GIRK-like conductance as the first target of purinergic signaling in chemosensitive RTN neurons. This work may also have clinical relevance since A1 receptor antagonists like caffeine are used to treat respiratory problems in premature infancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Newly Identified Electrically Coupled Neurons Support Development of the Drosophila Giant Fiber Model Circuit</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Giant Fiber (GF) escape circuit is an extensively studied model for neuron connectivity and function. Researchers have long taken advantage of the simple linear neuronal pathway, which begins at peripheral sensory modalities, travels through the central GF Interneuron (GFI) to motor neurons, and terminates on wing/leg muscles. This circuit is more complex than it seems however, as there exists a complex web of coupled neurons connected to the GFI, which widely innervate the thoracic ganglion. Here, we define four new neuron clusters dye-coupled to the central GFI, which we name GF Coupled (GFC) 1-4. We identify new transgenic Gal4 drivers that express specifically in these neurons, and map both neuronal architecture and synaptic polarity. GFC1-4 share a central site of GFI connectivity, the Inframedial Bridge (IB), where the neurons each form electrical synapses. Targeted apoptotic ablation of GFC1 reveals a key role for proper development of the GF circuit, including the maintenance of GFI connectivity with upstream and downstream synaptic partners. GFC1 ablation frequently results in loss of one GFI, which is always compensated for by contralateral innervation from a branch of the persisting GFI axon. Overall, this work reveals extensively coupled interconnectivity within the GF circuit, and the requirement of coupled neurons for circuit development. Identification of this large population of electrically-coupled neurons in this classic model, and the ability to genetically manipulate these electrically synapsed neurons, expands the GF system capabilities for the nuanced, sophisticated circuit dissection necessary for deeper investigations into brain formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Genetic model neural circuits with individually identifiable neurons help us understand how nervous systems wire together during development, and then operate through coordinated chemical and electrical signaling. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Giant Fiber circuit has long served as such a model, due to large neuron size, genetic malleability and easily visualized behavioral output: a jump in response to a threat. This study unveils new members of this circuit, all of which synapse with the circuit at one site on the central Giant Fiber Interneuron. We use new tools to identify and transgenically manipulate these neurons and show that these neurons are required for proper circuit development. This study provides a detailed circuit map for further dissection of neuronal connectivity and electrically-coupled communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Overweighed mice show coordinated homeostatic and hedonic transcriptional response across brain</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Obesogenic diets lead to overeating and obesity by inducing the expression of genes involved in hedonic and homeostatic responses in specific brain regions. However, how the effects on gene expression are coordinated in the brain so far remains largely unknown. In our study, we provided mice with access to energy-dense diet, which induced overeating and overweight, and we explored the transcriptome changes across the main regions involved in feeding and energy balance: hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, we detected two regulatory processes: a switch-like regulation with differentially expressed genes changing over 1.5-fold, and &quot;fine-tuned&quot; subtler changes of genes whose levels correlated with body weight and behavioral changes. We found that genes in both categories were positioned within specific topologically associating domains (TADs), which were often differently regulated across different brain regions. These TADs were enriched in genes relevant for the physiological and behavioral observed changes. Our results suggest that chromatin structure coordinates diet-dependent transcriptional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mice fed with free-choice access to chocolate mixture become overweight and compulsive, recapitulating what happens during obesity. For the first time, we correlated these physical and behavioural changes with the transcriptome in the frontal cortex and the striatum, involved in the hedonic &quot;liking&quot; associated to eating, and the hypothalamus, involved in the homeostasic regulation of food intake. We detected two groups of genes: some transcript were strongly deregulated in term of fold changes; while others were only subtly deregulated but were especially correlating with measurements associated with body-weight and compulsivity. These genes were not randomly distributed, but were positioned in chromatin domains, many of which rich in genes differentially co-regulated across brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Six‐months assessment of a hand prosthesis with intraneural tactile feedback</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25384?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a six months clinical study with three trans‐radial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
