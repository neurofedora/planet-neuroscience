Discriminating the causative disease variant(s) for individuals with inherited or &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations presents one of the main challenges faced by the clinical genetics community today. Computational approaches for variant prioritization include machine learning methods utilizing a large number of features, including molecular information, interaction networks, or phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate the PhenomeNET Variant Predictor (PVP) system that exploits semantic technologies and automated reasoning over genotype-phenotype relations to filter and prioritize variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets. We demonstrate the performance of PVP in identifying causative variants on a large number of synthetic whole exome and whole genome sequences, covering a wide range of diseases and syndromes. In a retrospective study, we further illustrate the application of PVP for the interpretation of whole exome sequencing data in patients suffering from congenital hypothyroidism. We find that PVP accurately identifies causative variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets and provides a powerful resource for the discovery of causal variants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDgNhG1ME4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deeper exploration of the brain’s vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aRCvW-nYvK8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effect of transcription factor resource sharing on gene expression noise</title>

Gene expression is intrinsically a stochastic (noisy) process with important implications for cellular functions. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of gene expression noise remains one of the key challenges of regulatory biology. Theoretical models of transcription often incorporate the kinetics of how transcription factors (TFs) interact with a single promoter to impact gene expression noise. However, inside single cells multiple identical gene copies as well as additional binding sites can compete for a limiting pool of TFs. Here we develop a simple kinetic model of transcription, which explicitly incorporates this interplay between TF copy number and its binding sites. We show that TF sharing enhances noise in mRNA distribution across an isogenic population of cells. Moreover, when a single gene copy shares it’s TFs with multiple competitor sites, the mRNA variance as a function of the mean remains unaltered by their presence. Hence, all the data for variance as a function of mean expression collapse onto a single master curve independent of the strength and number of competitor sites. However, this result does not hold true when the competition stems from multiple copies of the same gene. Therefore, although previous studies showed that the mean expression follows a universal master curve, our findings suggest that different scenarios of competition bear distinct signatures at the level of variance. Intriguingly, the introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution. These results demonstrate the impact of limited availability of TF resource on the regulation of noise in gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TIEMlk0J4j0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamics of adaptive immunity against phage in bacterial populations</title>

The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) mechanism allows bacteria to adaptively defend against phages by acquiring short genomic sequences (spacers) that target specific sequences in the viral genome. We propose a population dynamical model where immunity can be both acquired and lost. The model predicts regimes where bacterial and phage populations can co-exist, others where the populations exhibit damped oscillations, and still others where one population is driven to extinction. Our model considers two key parameters: (1) ease of acquisition and (2) spacer effectiveness in conferring immunity. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations show that if spacers differ mainly in ease of acquisition, or if the probability of acquiring them is sufficiently high, bacteria develop a diverse population of spacers. On the other hand, if spacers differ mainly in their effectiveness, their final distribution will be highly peaked, akin to a “winner-take-all” scenario, leading to a specialized spacer distribution. Bacteria can interpolate between these limiting behaviors by actively tuning their overall acquisition probability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rk5kitjCtOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Achieving global perfect homeostasis through transporter regulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yonatan Savir, Alexander Martynov, Michael Springer&lt;/p&gt;

Nutrient homeostasis—the maintenance of relatively constant internal nutrient concentrations in fluctuating external environments—is essential to the survival of most organisms. Transcriptional regulation of plasma membrane transporters by internal nutrient concentrations is typically assumed to be the main mechanism by which homeostasis is achieved. While this mechanism is homeostatic we show that it does not achieve global perfect homeostasis—a condition where internal nutrient concentrations are completely independent of external nutrient concentrations for all external nutrient concentrations. We show that the criterion for global perfect homeostasis is that transporter levels must be inversely proportional to net nutrient flux into the cell and that downregulation of active transporters (activity-dependent regulation) is a simple and biologically plausible mechanism that meets this criterion. Activity-dependent transporter regulation creates a trade-off between robustness and efficiency, i.e., the system's ability to withstand perturbation in external nutrients and the transporter production rate needed to maintain homeostasis. Additionally, we show that a system that utilizes both activity-dependent transporter downregulation and regulation of transporter synthesis by internal nutrient levels can create a system that mitigates the shortcomings of each of the individual mechanisms. This analysis highlights the utility of activity-dependent regulation in achieving homeostasis and calls for a re-examination of the mechanisms of regulation of other homeostatic systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-bFXMDNyVUw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experimental data suggest that neural circuits configure their synaptic
connectivity for a given computational task. They also point to dopamine-gated
stochastic spine dynamics as an important underlying mechanism, and they show
that the stochastic component of synaptic plasticity is surprisingly strong. We
propose a model that elucidates how task-dependent self-configuration of neural
circuits can emerge through these mechanisms. The Fokker-Planck equation allows
us to relate local stochastic processes at synapses to the stationary
distribution of network configurations, and thereby to computational properties
of the network. This framework suggests a new model for reward-gated network
plasticity, where one replaces the common policy gradient paradigm by
continuously ongoing stochastic policy search (sampling) from a posterior
distribution of network configurations. This posterior integrates priors that
encode for example previously attained knowledge and structural constraints.
This model can explain the experimentally found capability of neural circuits
to configure themselves for a given task, and to compensate automatically for
changes in the network or task. We also show that experimental data on
dopamine-modulated spine dynamics can be modeled within this theoretical
framework, and that a strong stochastic component of synaptic plasticity is
essential for its performance.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Alterations in cortical thickness and structural connectivity are associated with symptom severity in bulimia nervosa</title>

	<description>Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a serious psychiatric illness defined by preoccupation with weight and shape, episodic binge-eating and compensatory behaviors. Although diagnosed BN has been associated with diffuse grey matter volume reductions, characterization of brain structure alterations in women with a range of BN symptoms has yet to be made. This study examined whether changes in cortical thickness (CT) scaled with BN symptom severity in a sample of 33 adult women (n = 10 BN; n = 5 EDNOS-BN). Our second objective was to assess global structural connectivity (SC) of CT and to determine if individual differences in global SC relate to BN symptom severity. We used the validated Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q; Fairburn &amp;amp; Beglin, 1994) as a continuous measure of BN symptom severity. Increased EDE-Q score was negatively related to global CT and local CT in the left middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and temporoparietal regions. Moreover, analysis of global SC indicated that BN-related cortical thinning preferentially occurred in regions with high global connectivity. Finally, we showed that individuals' contribution to global SC at the group level were significantly related to EDE-Q score, where increased EDE-Q score correlated with reduced connectivity of the left OFC and middle temporal cortex and increased connectivity of the right superior parietal lobule. Our findings offer novel insight into CT alterations in BN and further suggest that the combination of CT and structural connectivity measures may be sensitive to individual differences in BN symptom severity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Experience-dependent plasticity in accessory olfactory bulb interneurons following male-male social interaction</title>

	<description>Chemosensory information processing in the mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) guides the expression of social behavior. After salient chemosensory encounters, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) experiences changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition at reciprocal synapses between mitral cells (MCs) and local interneurons. The mechanisms underlying these changes remain controversial. Moreover, it remains unclear whether MC-interneuron plasticity is unique to specific behaviors, such as mating, or whether it is a more general feature of the AOB circuit. Here, we describe targeted electrophysiological studies of AOB inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), many of which upregulate the immediate-early gene Arc after male-male social experience. Following the resident-intruder paradigm, Arc-expressing IGCs in acute AOB slices from resident males displayed stronger excitation than non-expressing neighbors when sensory inputs are stimulated. The increased excitability of Arc-expressing IGCs was not correlated with changes in the strength or number of excitatory synapses with MCs, but is instead associated with increased intrinsic excitability and decreased HCN channel-mediated IH currents. Consistent with increased inhibition by IGCs, MCs responded to sensory input stimulation with decreased depolarization and spiking following resident-intruder encounters. These results reveal that non-mating behaviors drive AOB inhibitory plasticity, and indicate that increased MC inhibition involves intrinsic excitability changes in Arc-expressing interneurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cell-Type Specific Burst Firing Interacts With Theta And Beta Activity In Prefrontal Cortex During Attention States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127811v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127811v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Population-level theta and beta band activity in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) are prominent signatures of endogenously controlled, adaptive behaviors. But how these rhythmic activities are linked to cell-type specific activity has remained unclear. Here, we suggest such a cell-to-systems level linkage. We found that the rate of burst spiking events is enhanced particularly during attention states and that attention-specific burst spikes have a unique temporal relationship to local theta and beta band population level activities. For the 5-10Hz theta frequency range, bursts coincided with transient increases of local theta power relative to non-bursts, particularly for bursts of putative interneurons. For the 16-30Hz beta frequency, bursts of putative interneurons phase synchronized stronger than nonbursts, and were associated with larger beta power modulation. In contrast, burst of putative pyramidal cells were overall similarly beta-synchronized than nonbursts, but were linked with stronger beta power only when they occurred early in the beta cycle. These findings suggests that in the ACC/PFC during attention states, mechanisms underlying burst firing are intimately linked to narrow band population level activities, providing a cell-type specific window into the emergence, resetting, or termination of oscillatory activities.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global Exosome Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (RRMS) and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and over 50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative PCR with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients vs HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNA was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNA were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; secretion of these miRNA by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Since putative targets for these miRNA include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus exosomal miRNA might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish MS relapse. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Surgically disconnected temporal pole exhibits resting functional connectivity with remote brain regions</title>

	<description>Functional connectivity, as measured by resting-state fMRI, has proven a powerful method for studying brain systems in the context of behavior, development, and disease states. However, the relationship of functional connectivity to structural connectivity remains unclear. If functional connectivity relies on structural connectivity, then anatomical isolation of a brain region should eliminate functional connectivity with other brain regions. We tested this by measuring functional connectivity of the surgically disconnected temporal pole in resection patients (N=5; mean age 37; 2F, 3M). Functional connectivity was evaluated based on coactivation of whole-brain fMRI data with the average low-frequency BOLD signal from disconnected tissue in each patient. In sharp contrast to our prediction, we observed significant functional connectivity between the disconnected temporal pole and remote brain regions in each disconnection case. These findings raise important questions about the neural bases of functional connectivity measures derived from the fMRI BOLD signal.</description>

	<description>Since its introduction, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), or neural decoding, has transformed the field of cognitive neuroscience. Underlying its influence is a crucial inference, which we call the Decoder's Dictum: if information can be decoded from patterns of neural activity, then this provides strong evidence about what information those patterns represent. Although the Dictum is a widely held and well-motivated principle in decoding research, it has received scant philosophical attention. We critically evaluate the Dictum, arguing that it is false: decodability is a poor guide for revealing the content of neural representations. However, we also suggest how the Dictum can be improved on, in order to better justify inferences about neural representation using MVPA.</description>

	<description>To avoid costly situations animals must be able to rapidly predict imminent threat based on past experience and present noisy sensory evidence. We aimed to characterize to what extent active exploration strategies, can be adaptively tuned to achieve this goal. We measured how eye-movement patterns on 8 faces, organized along a circular similarity continuum, were modified after aversive learning and generalization. Using model-based Fixation Similarity Analysis, we characterized how similarity relationships between exploration strategies were modified after volunteers learnt to pair one face (CS+) with a mild electric shock. Initially, viewing patterns reflected the circular physical similarity structure of different faces, indicating that eye-movements were guided by subtle differences between faces. Following aversive learning, the similarity structure of exploration patterns became elliptical and stretched along the adversity gradient defined by the CS+ and the most dissimilar neutral face (CS-), indicating that exploration patterns on these faces were most dissimilar. These findings suggest that the need to predict adversity introduces substantial remodelling of exploration patterns and influences entire sensorimotor loops by selecting fixation locations that can help in categorizing stimuli as aversive or safe.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simple biochemical networks allow accurate sensing of multiple ligands with a single receptor</title>

Cells use surface receptors to estimate concentrations of external ligands. Limits on the accuracy of such estimations have been well studied for pairs of ligand and receptor species. However, the environment typically contains many ligands, which can bind to the same receptors with different affinities, resulting in cross-talk. In traditional rate models, such cross-talk prevents accurate inference of concentrations of individual ligands. In contrast, here we show that knowing the precise timing sequence of stochastic binding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information about multiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy. We show that such high-accuracy estimation of multiple concentrations can be realized with simple structural modifications of the familiar kinetic proofreading biochemical network diagram. We give two specific examples of such modifications. We argue that structural and functional features of real cellular biochemical sensory networks in immune cells, such as feedforward and feedback loops or ligand antagonism, sometimes can be understood as solutions to the accurate multi-ligand estimation problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ubt69dgmPdA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Post-transcriptional regulation is regarded as one of the major processes involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is mainly performed by RNA binding proteins and microRNAs, which target RNAs and typically affect their stability. Recent efforts from the scientific community have aimed at understanding post-transcriptional regulation at a global scale by using high-throughput sequencing techniques such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), which facilitates identification of binding sites of these regulatory factors. However, the diversity in the experimental procedures and bioinformatics analyses has hindered the integration of multiple datasets and thus limited the development of an integrated view of post-transcriptional regulation. In this work, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 107 CLIP datasets from 49 different RBPs in HEK293 cells to shed light on the complex interactions that govern post-transcriptional regulation. By developing a more stringent CLIP analysis pipeline we have discovered the existence of conserved regulatory AU-rich regions in the 3’UTRs where miRNAs and RBPs that regulate several processes such as polyadenylation or mRNA stability bind. Analogous to promoters, many factors have binding sites overlapping or in close proximity in these hotspots and hence the regulation of the mRNA may depend on their relative concentrations. This hypothesis is supported by RBP knockdown experiments that alter the relative concentration of RBPs in the cell. Upon AGO2 knockdown (KD), transcripts containing “free” target sites show increased expression levels compared to those containing target sites in hotspots, which suggests that target sites within hotspots are less available for miRNAs to bind. Interestingly, these hotspots appear enriched in genes with regulatory functions such as DNA binding and RNA binding. Taken together, our results suggest that hotspots are functional regulatory elements that define an extra layer of regulation of post-transcriptional regulatory networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eu7ni9y2PKY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Heterogeneous firing responses predict diverse couplings to presynaptic activity in mice layer V pyramidal neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yann Zerlaut, Alain Destexhe&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of input activity lead to various impact on the membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6jte2cL8TGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elucidating principles that underlie computation in neural networks is
currently a major research topic of interest in neuroscience. Transfer Entropy
(TE) is increasingly used as a tool to bridge the gap between network
structure, function, and behavior in fMRI studies. Computational models allow
us to bridge the gap even further by directly associating individual neuron
activity with behavior. However, most computational models that have analyzed
embodied behaviors have employed non-spiking neurons. On the other hand,
computational models that employ spiking neural networks tend to be restricted
to disembodied tasks. We show for the first time the artificial evolution and
TE-analysis of embodied spiking neural networks to perform a
cognitively-interesting behavior. Specifically, we evolved an agent controlled
by an Izhikevich neural network to perform a visual categorization task. The
smallest networks capable of performing the task were found by repeating
evolutionary runs with different network sizes. Informational analysis of the
best solution revealed task-specific TE-network clusters, suggesting that
within-task homogeneity and across-task heterogeneity were key to behavioral
success. Moreover, analysis of the ensemble of solutions revealed that
task-specificity of TE-network clusters correlated with fitness. This provides
an empirically testable hypothesis that links network structure to behavior.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analysis of a pacemaker activity in a two-component model of some brainstem neurons. (arXiv:1704.03941v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03941</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic brainstem (including midbrain)
neurons, often exhibit spontaneous and fairly regular spiking with frequencies
of order a few Hz, though dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons only exhibit
such pacemaker-type activity in vitro or in vivo under special conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of ion channel types contribute to such spiking so that
detailed modeling of spike generation leads to the requirement of solving very
large systems of differential equations. It is useful to have simplified
mathematical models of spiking in such neurons so that, for example, features
of inputs and output spike trains can be incorporated including stochastic
effects for possible use in network models.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we investigate a simple two-component conductance-based model
of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Solutions are computed numerically and with
suitably chosen parameters mimic features of pacemaker-type spiking in the
above types of neurons. The effects of varying parameters is investigated in
detail, it being found that there is extreme sensitivity to eight of them.
Transitions from non-spiking to spiking are examined for two of these, the
half-activation potential for an activation variable and the added
(depolarizing) current and contrasted with the behavior of the classical
Hodgkin-Huxley system. The plateaux levels between spikes can be adjusted, by
changing a set of voltage parameters, to agree with experimental observations.
Experiment has shown that in, in vivo, dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons'
pacemaker activity can be induced by the removal of excitatory inputs or the
introduction of inhibitory ones. These properties are confirmed by mimicking
opposite such changes in the model, which resulted in a change from pacemaker
activity to bursting-type phenomena.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A causal role for right frontopolar cortex in directed, but not random, exploration</title>

	<description>The explore-exploit dilemma occurs anytime we must choose between exploring unknown options for information and exploiting known resources for reward. Previous work suggests that people use two different strategies to solve the explore-exploit dilemma: directed exploration, driven by information seeking, and random exploration, driven by decision noise. Here, we show that these two strategies rely on different neural systems. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit the right frontopolar cortex, we were able to selectively inhibit directed exploration while leaving random exploration intact. This suggests a causal role for right frontopolar cortex in directed, but not random, exploration and that directed and random exploration rely on (at least partially) dissociable neural systems.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring modulators of genetic interactions with epistatic nested effects models</title>

Maps of genetic interactions can dissect functional redundancies in cellular networks. Gene expression profiles as high-dimensional molecular readouts of combinatorial perturbations provide a detailed view of genetic interactions, but can be hard to interpret if different gene sets respond in different ways (called &lt;i&gt;mixed epistasis&lt;/i&gt;). Here we test the hypothesis that mixed epistasis between a gene pair can be explained by the action of a third gene that modulates the interaction. We have extended the framework of Nested Effects Models (NEMs), a type of graphical model specifically tailored to analyze high-dimensional gene perturbation data, to incorporate logical functions that describe interactions between regulators on downstream genes and proteins. We benchmark our approach in the controlled setting of a simulation study and show high accuracy in inferring the correct model. In an application to data from deletion mutants of kinases and phosphatases in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; we show that epistatic NEMs can point to modulators of genetic interactions. Our approach is implemented in the R-package ‘epiNEM’ available from https://github.com/cbg-ethz/epiNEM and https://bioconductor.org/packages/epiNEM/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dCx7jocTDw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A high level of HER2 expression in breast cancer correlates with a higher tumor growth rate, high metastatic potential, and a poor long-term patient survival rate. Pertuzumab, a human monoclonal antibody, can reduce the effect of HER2 overexpression by preventing HER2 dimerization. In this study, a combination protocol of molecular dynamics modeling and MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations was applied to design peptides that interact with HER2 based on the HER2/pertuzumab crystal structure. Based on a β hairpin in pertuzumab from Glu46 to Lys65—which plays a key role in interacting with HER2—mutations were carried out &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; to improve the binding free energy of the hairpin that interacts with the Phe256-Lys314 of the HER2 protein. Combined the use of one-bead-one-compound library screening, among all the mutations, a peptide (58F63Y) with the lowest binding free energy was confirmed experimentally to have the highest affinity, and it may be used as a new probe in diagnosing and treating HER2-positive breast cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRx0fy4iclw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From elementary flux modes to elementary flux vectors: Metabolic pathway analysis with arbitrary linear flux constraints</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005409</guid>

Elementary flux modes (EFMs) emerged as a formal concept to describe metabolic pathways and have become an established tool for constraint-based modeling and metabolic network analysis. EFMs are characteristic (support-minimal) vectors of the flux cone that contains all feasible steady-state flux vectors of a given metabolic network. EFMs account for (homogeneous) linear constraints arising from reaction irreversibilities and the assumption of steady state; however, other (inhomogeneous) linear constraints, such as minimal and maximal reaction rates frequently used by other constraint-based techniques (such as flux balance analysis [FBA]), cannot be directly integrated. These additional constraints further restrict the space of feasible flux vectors and turn the flux cone into a general flux polyhedron in which the concept of EFMs is not directly applicable anymore. For this reason, there has been a conceptual gap between EFM-based (pathway) analysis methods and linear optimization (FBA) techniques, as they operate on different geometric objects. One approach to overcome these limitations was proposed ten years ago and is based on the concept of &lt;i&gt;elementary flux vectors&lt;/i&gt; (EFVs). Only recently has the community started to recognize the potential of EFVs for metabolic network analysis. In fact, EFVs exactly represent the conceptual development required to generalize the idea of EFMs from flux cones to flux polyhedra. This work aims to present a concise theoretical and practical introduction to EFVs that is accessible to a broad audience. We highlight the close relationship between EFMs and EFVs and demonstrate that almost all applications of EFMs (in flux cones) are possible for EFVs (in flux polyhedra) as well. In fact, certain properties can only be studied with EFVs. Thus, we conclude that EFVs provide a powerful and unifying framework for constraint-based modeling of metabolic networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAQqy35d7wM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Random Item Generation tasks (RIG) are commonly used to assess high cognitive abilities such as inhibition or sustained attention. They also draw upon our approximate sense of complexity. A detrimental effect of aging on pseudo-random productions has been demonstrated for some tasks, but little is as yet known about the developmental curve of cognitive complexity over the lifespan. We investigate the complexity trajectory across the lifespan of human responses to five common RIG tasks, using a large sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3429). Our main finding is that the developmental curve of the estimated algorithmic complexity of responses is similar to what may be expected of a measure of higher cognitive abilities, with a performance peak around 25 and a decline starting around 60, suggesting that RIG tasks yield good estimates of such cognitive abilities. Our study illustrates that very short strings of, i.e., 10 items, are sufficient to have their complexity reliably estimated and to allow the documentation of an age-dependent decline in the approximate sense of complexity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jh8fhJNsGrM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How brains are built: Principles of computational neuroscience. (arXiv:1704.03855v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03855</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;'If I cannot build it, I do not understand it.' So said Nobel laureate
Richard Feynman, and by his metric, we understand a bit about physics, less
about chemistry, and almost nothing about biology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we fully understand a phenomenon, we can specify its entire sequence of
events, causes, and effects so completely that it is possible to fully simulate
it, with all its internal mechanisms intact. Achieving that level of
understanding is rare. It is commensurate with constructing a full design for a
machine that could serve as a stand-in for the thing being studied. To
understand a phenomenon sufficiently to fully simulate it is to understand it
computationally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Computation' does not refer to computers per se. Rather, it refers to the
underlying principles and methods that make them work. As Turing Award
recipient Edsger Dijkstra said, computational science 'is no more about
computers than astronomy is about telescopes.' Computational science is the
study of the hidden rules underlying complex phenomena from physics to
psychology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational neuroscience, then, has the aim of understanding brains
sufficiently well to be able to simulate their functions, thereby subsuming the
twin goals of science and engineering: deeply understanding the inner workings
of our brains, and being able to construct simulacra of them. As simple robots
today substitute for human physical abilities, in settings from factories to
hospitals, so brain engineering will construct stand-ins for our mental
abilities, and possibly even enable us to fix our brains when they break.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans take advantage of real world symmetries for various tasks, yet
capturing their superb symmetry perception mechanism into a computational model
remains elusive. Encouraged by a new discovery (CVPR 2016) demonstrating
extremely high inter-person accuracy of human perceived symmetries in the wild,
we have created the first deep-learning neural network for reflection and
rotation symmetry detection (Sym-NET), trained on photos from MS-COCO (Common
Object in COntext) dataset with nearly 11K symmetry-labels from more than 400
human observers. We employ novel methods to convert discrete human labels into
symmetry heatmaps, capture symmetry densely in an image and quantitatively
evaluate Sym-NET against multiple existing computer vision algorithms. Using
the symmetry competition testsets from CVPR 2013 and unseen MS-COCO photos,
Sym-NET comes out as the winner with significantly superior performance over
all other competitors. Beyond mathematically well-defined symmetries on a
plane, Sym-NET demonstrates abilities to identify viewpoint-varied 3D
symmetries, partially occluded symmetrical objects and symmetries at a semantic
level.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cooperation and competition between human players in repeated microeconomic
games offer a powerful window onto social phenomena such as the establishment,
breakdown and repair of trust. This offers the prospect of particular insight
into populations of subjects suffering from socially-debilitating conditions
such as borderline personality disorder. However, although a suitable
foundation for the quantitative analysis of such games exists, namely the
Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP),
computational considerations have hitherto limited its application. Here, we
improve inference in I-POMDPs in a canonical trust game, and thereby highlight
and address two previously unmodelled phenomena: a form of social risk-aversion
exhibited by the player who is in control of the interaction in the game, and
irritation or anger exhibited by both players. Irritation arises when partners
apparently defect, and it causes a precipitate breakdown in cooperation.
Failing to model one's partner's propensity for it leads to substantial
economic inefficiency. We illustrate these behaviours using evidence drawn from
the play of large cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127365v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Previous research investigating structural neurodevelopmental alterations in individuals who were born very preterm demonstrated a complex pattern of grey matter changes that defy straightforward summary. Here we addressed this problem by characterising volumetric brain alterations in individuals who were born very preterm from adolescence to adulthood at three hierarchically related levels - global, modular and regional. We demarcated structural components that were either particularly resilient or vulnerable to the impact of very preterm birth. We showed that individuals who were born very preterm had smaller global grey matter volume compared to controls, with subcortical and medial temporal regions being particularly affected. Conversely, frontal and lateral parieto-temporal cortices were relatively resilient to the effects of very preterm birth, possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. Exploratory analyses supported this hypothesis by showing a stronger association of lateral parieto-temporal volume with IQ in the very preterm group compared to controls. We then related these alterations to brain maturation processes. Very preterm individuals exhibited a higher maturation index compared to controls, indicating accelerated brain ageing and this was specifically associated with younger gestational age. We discuss how the findings of accelerated maturation might be reconciled with evidence of delayed maturation at earlier stages of development.</description>

In humans, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI BOLD measurements has emerged as an important approach for studying neural representations. An implicit, untested assumption underlying many MVPA studies is that the base rate of decoding information encoded in neuronal activity from BOLD activity patterns, is invariant across brain regions. Here we test this assumption by estimating these base rates from a meta-analysis of published MVPA studies. We show that this assumption is violated for the prefrontal cortex, which shows a significantly lower base rate for decoding than visual sensory cortex. Our results have implications for the design and interpretation of MVPA studies of prefrontal cortex, and raise important questions about its functional organization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local processing of visual information in neurites of VGluT3-expressing amacrine cells</title>

	<description>Synaptic inputs to neurons are distributed across extensive neurite arborizations. To what extent arbors process inputs locally or integrate them globally is, for most neurons, unknown. This question is particularly relevant for amacrine cells, a diverse class of retinal interneurons, which receive input and provide output through the same neurites. Here, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging to analyze visual processing in VGluT3-expressing amacrine cells (VG3-ACs), an important component of object motion sensitive circuits in the retina. VG3-AC neurites differed in their preferred stimulus contrast (ON vs. OFF); and ON and OFF responses varied in transience and preferred stimulus size. Contrast preference changed predictably with the laminar position of neurites in the inner plexiform layer. Yet, neurites at all depths were strongly activated by local but not by global image motion. Thus, VG3-AC neurites process visual information locally, exhibiting diverse responses to contrast steps, but uniform object motion selectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gamma Oscillations In The Rat Ventral Striatum Originate In The Piriform Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127126v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the human and rodent ventral striatum (vStr) exhibit prominent, behaviorally relevant gamma-band oscillations. These oscillations are related to local spiking activity and transiently synchronize with anatomically related areas, suggesting a possible role in organizing vStr activity. However, the origin of vStr gamma is unknown. We recorded vStr gamma oscillations across a 1.4mm2 grid spanned by 64 recording electrodes as rats rested and foraged for rewards, revealing a highly consistent power gradient originating in the adjacent piriform cortex. Phase differences across the vStr were consistently small (&amp;lt;10 degrees) and current source density analysis further confirmed the absence of local sink-source pairs in the vStr. Reversible occlusions of the ipsilateral (but not contralateral) nostril, known to abolish gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, strongly reduced vStr gamma power and the occurrence of transient gamma-band events. These results imply that local circuitry is not a major contributor to gamma oscillations in the vStr LFP, and that piriform cortex is an important driver of gamma-band oscillations in the vStr and associated limbic areas.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Increased decision thresholds enhance information gathering performance in juvenile Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias U. Hauser, Michael Moutoussis, Reto Iannaccone, Silvia Brem, Susanne Walitza, Renate Drechsler, Peter Dayan, Raymond J. Dolan&lt;/p&gt;

Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be described as cautious and hesitant, manifesting an excessive indecisiveness that hinders efficient decision making. However, excess caution in decision making may also lead to better performance in specific situations where the cost of extended deliberation is small. We compared 16 juvenile OCD patients with 16 matched healthy controls whilst they performed a sequential information gathering task under different external cost conditions. We found that patients with OCD outperformed healthy controls, winning significantly more points. The groups also differed in the number of draws required prior to committing to a decision, but not in decision accuracy. A novel Bayesian computational model revealed that subjective sampling costs arose as a non-linear function of sampling, closely resembling an escalating urgency signal. Group difference in performance was best explained by a later emergence of these subjective costs in the OCD group, also evident in an increased decision threshold. Our findings present a novel computational model and suggest that enhanced information gathering in OCD can be accounted for by a higher decision threshold arising out of an altered perception of costs that, in some specific contexts, may be advantageous.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kYO-DetTaxM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Phosphorylation State of the Drosophila TRP Channel Modulates the Frequency Response to Oscillating Light In Vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4213?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; photoreceptors respond to oscillating light of high frequency (~100 Hz), while the detected maximal frequency is modulated by the light rearing conditions, thus enabling high sensitivity to light and high temporal resolution. However, the molecular basis for this adaptive process is unclear. Here, we report that dephosphorylation of the light-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel at S936 is a fast, graded, light-dependent, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent process that is partially modulated by the rhodopsin phosphatase retinal degeneration C (RDGC). Electroretinogram measurements of the frequency response to oscillating lights &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; revealed that dark-reared flies expressing wild-type TRP exhibited a detection limit of oscillating light at relatively low frequencies, which was shifted to higher frequencies upon light adaptation. Strikingly, preventing phosphorylation of the S936-TRP site by alanine substitution in transgenic &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;trp&lt;sup&gt;S936A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) abolished the difference in frequency response between dark-adapted and light-adapted flies, resulting in high-frequency response also in dark-adapted flies. In contrast, inserting a phosphomimetic mutation by substituting the S936-TRP site to aspartic acid (&lt;i&gt;trp&lt;sup&gt;S936D&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) set the frequency response of light-adapted flies to low frequencies typical of dark-adapted flies. Light-adapted &lt;i&gt;rdgC&lt;/i&gt; mutant flies showed relatively high S936-TRP phosphorylation levels and light–dark phosphorylation dynamics. These findings suggest that RDGC is one but not the only phosphatase involved in pS936-TRP dephosphorylation. Together, this study indicates that TRP channel dephosphorylation is a regulatory process that affects the detection limit of oscillating light according to the light rearing condition, thus adjusting dynamic processing of visual information under varying light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; photoreceptors exhibit high temporal resolution as manifested in frequency response to oscillating light of high frequency (≤~100 Hz). Light rearing conditions modulate the maximal frequency detected by photoreceptors, thus enabling them to maintain high sensitivity to light and high temporal resolution. However, the precise mechanisms for this process are not fully understood. Here, we show by combination of biochemistry and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology that transient receptor potential (TRP) channel dephosphorylation at a specific site is a fast, light-activated and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent regulatory process. TRP dephosphorylation affects the detection limit of oscillating light according to the adaptation state of the photoreceptor cells by shifting the detection limit to higher frequencies upon light adaptation. This novel mechanism thus adjusts dynamic processing of visual information under varying light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Depressive-Like Behaviors Are Regulated by NOX1/NADPH Oxidase by Redox Modification of NMDA Receptor 1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4200?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested in the development of psychiatric disorders. NOX1 is a nonphagocytic form of NADPH oxidase whose expression in the nervous system is negligible compared with other NOX isoforms. However, NOX1-derived ROS increase inflammatory pain and tolerance to opioid analgesia. To clarify the role of NOX1 in the brain, we examined depressive-like behaviors in mice deficient in &lt;i&gt;Nox1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Nox1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/Y&lt;/sup&gt;). Depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic social defeat stress or administration of corticosterone (CORT) were significantly ameliorated in &lt;i&gt;Nox1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/Y&lt;/sup&gt;. Generation of ROS was significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice administrated with CORT, while NOX1 mRNA was upregulated only in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) among brain areas responsible for emotional behaviors. Delivery of miRNA against NOX1 to VTA restored CORT-induced depressive-like behaviors in wild-type (WT) littermates. Administration of CORT to WT, but not to &lt;i&gt;Nox1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/Y&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly reduced transcript levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt;), with a concomitant increase in DNA methylation of the promoter regions in &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt;. Delivery of miRNA against NOX1 to VTA restored the level of BDNF mRNA in WT PFC. Redox proteome analyses demonstrated that NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) was among the molecules redox regulated by NOX1. In cultured cortical neurons, hydrogen peroxide significantly suppressed NMDA-induced upregulation of BDNF transcripts in NR1-expressing cells but not in cells harboring mutant NR1 (C744A). Together, these findings suggest a key role of NOX1 in depressive-like behaviors through NR1-mediated epigenetic modification of &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt; in the mesoprefrontal projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; NADPH oxidase is a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. We presently showed the involvement of a nonphagocytic type of NADPH oxidase, NOX1, in major depressive disorders, including behavioral, biochemical, and anatomical changes in mice. The oxidation of NR1 by NOX1-derived ROS was demonstrated in prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may be causally linked to the downregulation of BDNF, promoting depressive-like behaviors. Given that NOX1 is upregulated only in VTA but not in PFC, mesocortical projections appear to play a crucial role in NOX1-dependent depressive-like behaviors. Our study is the first to present the potential molecular mechanism underlying the development of major depression through the NOX1-induced oxidation of NR1 and epigenetic modification of &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Characterization of a Human Point Mutation of VGLUT3 (p.A211V) in the Rodent Brain Suggests a Nonuniform Distribution of the Transporter in Synaptic Vesicles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4181?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The atypical vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGLUT3) is expressed by subpopulations of neurons using acetylcholine, GABA, or serotonin as neurotransmitters. In addition, VGLUT3 is expressed in the inner hair cells of the auditory system. A mutation (p.A211V) in the gene that encodes VGLUT3 is responsible for progressive deafness in two unrelated families. In this study, we investigated the consequences of the p.A211V mutation in cell cultures and in the CNS of a mutant mouse. The mutation substantially decreased VGLUT3 expression (–70%). We measured VGLUT3-p.A211V activity by vesicular uptake in BON cells, electrophysiological recording of isolated neurons, and its ability to stimulate serotonergic accumulation in cortical synaptic vesicles. Despite a marked loss of expression, the activity of the mutated isoform was only minimally altered. Furthermore, mutant mice displayed none of the behavioral alterations that have previously been reported in VGLUT3 knock-out mice. Finally, we used stimulated emission depletion microscopy to analyze how the mutation altered VGLUT3 distribution within the terminals of mice expressing the mutated isoform. The mutation appeared to reduce the expression of the VGLUT3 transporter by simultaneously decreasing the number of VGLUT3-positive synaptic vesicles and the amount of VGLUT3 per synapses. These observations suggested that VGLUT3 global activity is not linearly correlated with VGLUT3 expression. Furthermore, our data unraveled a nonuniform distribution of VGLUT3 in synaptic vesicles. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this complex vesicular sorting will be critical to understand VGLUT's involvement in normal and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; VGLUT3 is an atypical member of the vesicular glutamate transporter family. A point mutation of VGLUT3 (VGLUT3-p.A211V) responsible for a progressive loss of hearing has been identified in humans. We observed that this mutation dramatically reduces VGLUT3 expression in terminals (~70%) without altering its function. Furthermore, using stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we found that reducing the expression levels of VGLUT3 diminished the number of VGLUT3-positive vesicles at synapses. These unexpected findings challenge the vision of a uniform distribution of synaptic vesicles at synapses. Therefore, the overall activity of VGLUT3 is not proportional to the level of VGLUT3 expression. These data will be key in interpreting the role of VGLUTs in human pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alteration of Neuronal Excitability and Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity in the Prefrontal Cortex of a Mouse Model of Mental Illness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using a genetic mouse model that faithfully recapitulates a &lt;i&gt;DISC1&lt;/i&gt; genetic alteration strongly associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, we examined the impact of this mutation within the prefrontal cortex. Although cortical layering, cytoarchitecture, and proteome were found to be largely unaffected, electrophysiological examination of the mPFC revealed both neuronal hyperexcitability and alterations in short-term synaptic plasticity consistent with enhanced neurotransmitter release. Increased excitability of layer II/III pyramidal neurons was accompanied by consistent reductions in voltage-activated potassium currents near the action potential threshold as well as by enhanced recruitment of inputs arising from superficial layers to layer V. We further observed reductions in both the paired-pulse ratios and the enhanced short-term depression of layer V synapses arising from superficial layers consistent with enhanced neurotransmitter release at these synapses. Recordings from layer II/III pyramidal neurons revealed action potential widening that could account for enhanced neurotransmitter release. Significantly, we found that reduced functional expression of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 substantially contributes to both the excitability and short-term plasticity alterations that we observed. The underlying dysregulation of K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 expression was attributable to cAMP elevations in the PFC secondary to reduced phosphodiesterase 4 activity present in Disc1 deficiency and was rescued by pharmacological blockade of adenylate cyclase. Our results demonstrate a potentially devastating impact of Disc1 deficiency on neural circuit function, partly due to K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 dysregulation that leads to a dual dysfunction consisting of enhanced neuronal excitability and altered short-term synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Schizophrenia is a profoundly disabling psychiatric illness with a devastating impact not only upon the afflicted but also upon their families and the broader society. Although the underlying causes of schizophrenia remain poorly understood, a growing body of studies has identified and strongly implicated various specific risk genes in schizophrenia pathogenesis. Here, using a genetic mouse model, we explored the impact of one of the most highly penetrant schizophrenia risk genes, &lt;i&gt;DISC1&lt;/i&gt;, upon the medial prefrontal cortex, the region believed to be most prominently dysfunctional in schizophrenia. We found substantial derangements in both neuronal excitability and short-term synaptic plasticity—parameters that critically govern neural circuit information processing—suggesting that similar changes may critically, and more broadly, underlie the neural computational dysfunction prototypical of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis along the Dorsoventral Axis Contributes Differentially to Environmental Enrichment Combined with Voluntary Exercise in Alleviating Chronic Inflammatory Pain in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy, such as environmental enrichment combined with voluntary exercise (EE-VEx), is under active investigation as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment for chronic pain. However, the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of EE-VEx remain unclear. In mice with intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant, our results revealed that EE-VEx alleviated perceptual, affective, and cognitive dimensions of chronic inflammatory pain. These effects of EE-VEx on chronic pain were contingent on the occurrence of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in a functionally dissociated manner along the dorsoventral axis: neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus participated in alleviating perceptual and affective components of chronic pain by EE-VEx, whereas neurogenesis in the dorsal dentate gyrus was involved in EE-VEx's cognitive-enhancing effects. Chronic inflammatory pain was accompanied by decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus, which were reversed by EE-VEx. Overexpression of BDNF in the dentate gyrus mimicked the effects of EE-VEx. Our results demonstrate distinct contribution of adult hippocampal neurogenesis along the dorsoventral axis to EE-VEx's beneficial effects on different dimensions of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Environmental enrichment combined with voluntary exercise (EE-VEx) is under active investigation as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment for chronic pain, but its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In a mouse model of inflammatory pain, the present study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of EE-VEx on chronic pain depend on adult neurogenesis with a dorsoventral dissociation along the hippocampal axis. Adult neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus participates in alleviating perceptual and affective components of chronic pain by EE-VEx, whereas that in the dorsal pole is involved in EE-VEx's cognitive-enhancing effects in chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gene Expression Profiling with Cre-Conditional Pseudorabies Virus Reveals a Subset of Midbrain Neurons That Participate in Reward Circuitry</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine pathway receives inputs from numerous regions of the brain as part of a neural system that detects rewarding stimuli and coordinates a behavioral response. The capacity to simultaneously map and molecularly define the components of this complex multisynaptic circuit would thus advance our understanding of the determinants of motivated behavior. To accomplish this, we have constructed pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains in which viral propagation and fluorophore expression are activated only after exposure to Cre recombinase. Once activated in Cre-expressing neurons, the virus serially labels chains of presynaptic neurons. Dual injection of GFP and mCherry tracing viruses simultaneously illuminates nigrostriatal and mesolimbic circuitry and shows no overlap, demonstrating that PRV transmission is confined to synaptically connected neurons. To molecularly profile mesolimbic dopamine neurons and their presynaptic inputs, we injected Cre-conditional GFP virus into the NAc of (anti-GFP) nanobody-L10 transgenic mice and immunoprecipitated translating ribosomes from neurons infected after retrograde tracing. Analysis of purified RNA revealed an enrichment of transcripts expressed in neurons of the dorsal raphe nuclei and lateral hypothalamus that project to the mesolimbic dopamine circuit. These studies identify important inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and further show that PRV circuit-directed translating ribosome affinity purification can be broadly applied to identify molecularly defined neurons comprising complex, multisynaptic circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mesolimbic dopamine circuit integrates signals from key brain regions to detect and respond to rewarding stimuli. To further define this complex multisynaptic circuit, we constructed a panel of Cre recombinase-activated pseudorabies viruses (PRVs) that enabled retrograde tracing of neural inputs that terminate on Cre-expressing neurons. Using these viruses and Retro-TRAP (translating ribosome affinity purification), a previously reported molecular profiling method, we developed a novel technique that provides anatomic as well as molecular information about the neural components of polysynaptic circuits. We refer to this new method as PRV-Circuit-TRAP (PRV circuit-directed TRAP). Using it, we have identified major projections to the mesolimbic dopamine circuit from the lateral hypothalamus and dorsal raphe nucleus and defined a discrete subset of transcripts expressed in these projecting neurons, which will allow further characterization of this important pathway. Moreover, the method we report is general and can be applied to the study of other neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FEF-Controlled Alpha Delay Activity Precedes Stimulus-Induced Gamma-Band Activity in Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4117?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent findings in the visual system of nonhuman primates have demonstrated an important role of gamma-band activity (40–100 Hz) in the feedforward flow of sensory information, whereas feedback control appears to be established dynamically by oscillations in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–18 Hz) bands (van Kerkoerle et al., 2014; Bastos et al., 2015). It is not clear, however, how alpha oscillations are controlled and how they interact with the flow of visual information mediated by gamma-band activity. Using noninvasive human MEG recordings in subjects performing a visuospatial attention task, we show that fluctuations in alpha power during a delay period in a spatial attention task preceded subsequent stimulus-driven gamma-band activity. Importantly, these interactions correlated with behavioral performance. Using Granger analysis, we further show that the right frontal-eye field (rFEF) exerted feedback control of the visual alpha oscillations. Our findings suggest that alpha oscillations controlled by the FEF route cortical information flow by modulating gamma-band activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual perception relies on a feedforward flow of information from sensory regions, which is modulated by a feedback drive. We have identified the neuronal dynamics supporting integration of the feedforward and feedback information. Alpha oscillations in early visual regions reflect feedback control when spatial attention is allocated and this control is exercised by the right frontal eye field. Importantly, the alpha-band activity predicted both performance and activity in the gamma band. In particular, gamma activity was modulated by the phase of the alpha oscillations. These findings provide novel insight into how the brain operates as a network and suggest that the integration of feedforward and feedback information is implemented by cross-frequency interactions between slow and fast neuronal oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Connectivity of Multiple Brain Regions Required for the Consolidation of Social Recognition Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social recognition memory is an essential and basic component of social behavior that is used to discriminate familiar and novel animals/humans. Previous studies have shown the importance of several brain regions for social recognition memories; however, the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of social recognition memory at the molecular and anatomic levels remain unknown. Here, we show a brain network necessary for the generation of social recognition memory in mice. A mouse genetic study showed that cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the formation of social recognition memory. Importantly, significant inductions of the CREB target immediate-early genes c-fos and Arc were observed in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 regions), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala (basolateral region) when social recognition memory was generated. Pharmacological experiments using a microinfusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin showed that protein synthesis in these brain regions is required for the consolidation of social recognition memory. These findings suggested that social recognition memory is consolidated through the activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the hippocampus/mPFC/ACC/amygdala. Network analyses suggested that these four brain regions show functional connectivity with other brain regions and, more importantly, that the hippocampus functions as a hub to integrate brain networks and generate social recognition memory, whereas the ACC and amygdala are important for coordinating brain activity when social interaction is initiated by connecting with other brain regions. We have found that a brain network composed of the hippocampus/mPFC/ACC/amygdala is required for the consolidation of social recognition memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here, we identify brain networks composed of multiple brain regions for the consolidation of social recognition memory. We found that social recognition memory is consolidated through CREB-meditated gene expression in the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala. Importantly, network analyses based on c-fos expression suggest that functional connectivity of these four brain regions with other brain regions is increased with time spent in social investigation toward the generation of brain networks to consolidate social recognition memory. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hippocampus functions as a hub to integrate brain networks and generate social recognition memory, whereas ACC and amygdala are important for coordinating brain activity when social interaction is initiated by connecting with other brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors that are crucial for neuronal development and higher cognitive processes. NMDAR dysfunction is involved in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases; however, the mechanistic link between the human pathology and NMDAR dysfunction is poorly understood. Rare missense variants within NMDAR subunits have been identified in numerous patients with mental or neurological disorders. We specifically focused on the GluN2B NMDAR subunit, which is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cortex throughout development. We analyzed several variants located in the GluN2B C terminus and found that three variants in patients with autism (S1415L) or schizophrenia (L1424F and S1452F) (S1413L, L1422F, and S1450F in rodents, respectively) displayed impaired binding to membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins. In addition, we observed a deficit in surface expression for GluN2B S1413L. Furthermore, there were fewer dendritic spines in GluN2B S1413L-expressing neurons. Importantly, synaptic NMDAR currents in neurons transfected with GluN2B S1413L in GluN2A/B-deficient mouse brain slices revealed only partial rescue of synaptic current amplitude. Functional properties of GluN2B S1413L in recombinant systems revealed no change in receptor properties, consistent with synaptic defects being the result of reduced trafficking and targeting of GluN2B S1413L to the synapse. Therefore, we find that GluN2B S1413L displays deficits in NMDAR trafficking, synaptic currents, and spine density, raising the possibility that this mutation may contribute to the phenotype in this autism patient. More broadly, our research demonstrates that the targeted study of certain residues in NMDARs based on rare variants identified in patients is a powerful approach to studying receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We have used a &quot;bedside-to-bench&quot; approach to investigate the functional regulation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Using information from deep sequencing of patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders, we investigated missense variants identified in the intracellular C-terminal domain of the GluN2B NMDAR subunit. We found several variants that displayed altered properties. In particular, one variant identified in a patient with autism, human GluN2B S1415L, displayed reduced surface expression and binding to PSD-95. Furthermore expression of GluN2B S1415L (S1413L in mouse) showed a deficit in rescue of synaptic NMDAR currents and fewer dendritic spines, consistent with other reports of spine abnormalities being associated with autism. More broadly, we demonstrate that using patient data is an effective approach to probing the structure/function relationship of NMDARs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reduction of Ether-Type Glycerophospholipids, Plasmalogens, by NF-{kappa}B Signal Leading to Microglial Activation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation characterized by activation of glial cells is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the reduction of ether-type glycerophospholipids, plasmalogens (Pls), in the brain is reported in AD patients, the mechanism of the reduction and its impact on neuroinflammation remained elusive. In the present study, we found for the first time that various inflammatory stimuli reduced Pls levels in murine glial cells via NF-B activation, which then downregulated a Pls-synthesizing enzyme, glycerone phosphate O-acyltransferase (Gnpat) through increased c-Myc recruitment onto the &lt;i&gt;Gnpat&lt;/i&gt; promoter. We also found that systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide, aging, and chronic restraint stress reduced brain Pls contents that were associated with glial NF-B activation, an increase in c-Myc expression, and downregulation of &lt;i&gt;Gnpat&lt;/i&gt; in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. More interestingly, the reduction of Pls contents in the murine cortex itself could increase the activated phenotype of microglial cells and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting further acceleration of neuroinflammation by reduction of brain Pls. A similar mechanism of &lt;i&gt;Gnpat&lt;/i&gt; reduction was also found in human cell lines, triple-transgenic AD mouse brain, and postmortem human AD brain tissues. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of neuroinflammation that may explain prolonged progression of AD and help us to explore preventive and therapeutic strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ether-type glycerophospholipids, plasmalogens (Pls), are reduced in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. We found that inflammatory stimuli reduced Pls contents by downregulation of the Pls-synthesizing enzyme glycerone phosphate O-acyltransferase (Gnpat) through NF-B-mediated recruitment of c-Myc onto the &lt;i&gt;Gnpat&lt;/i&gt; promoter in both murine and human cell lines. Murine brains after systemic lipopolysaccharide, chronic stress, and aging, as well as triple-transgenic AD mice and postmortem human AD brain tissues all showed increased c-Myc and reduced &lt;i&gt;Gnpat&lt;/i&gt; expression. Interestingly, knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Gnpat&lt;/i&gt; itself activated NF-B in glial cell lines and microglia in mouse cortex. Our findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of neuroinflammation and may help to develop a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: tDCS-Induced Modulation of GABA Levels and Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates human behavior, neuronal patterns, and metabolite concentrations, with exciting potential for neurorehabilitation. However, the understanding of tDCS-induced alterations on the neuronal level is incomplete, and conclusions from young adults, in whom the majority of studies have been conducted, cannot be easily transferred to older populations. Here, we investigated tDCS-induced effects in older adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 48; age range, 50–79 years) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify GABA levels as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess sensorimotor network strength and interhemispheric connectivity. In a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover design, we applied anodal tDCS (atDCS), cathodal tDCS (ctDCS), and sham tDCS (stDCS) over the left sensorimotor region. We observed a significant reduction of GABA levels after atDCS compared with stDCS, reflecting the preserved neuromodulatory effect of atDCS in older adults. Moreover, resting-state functional coupling was decreased during atDCS compared with stDCS, most likely indicating augmented efficiency in brain network functioning. Increased levels of interhemispheric connectivity with age were diminished by atDCS, suggesting stimulation-induced functional decoupling. Further, the magnitude of atDCS-induced local plasticity was related to baseline functional network strength. Our findings provide novel insight into the neuronal correlates underlying tDCS-induced neuronal plasticity in older adults and thus might help to develop tDCS interventions tailored to the aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates human behavior, neuronal patterns, and metabolite concentrations, with exciting potential for neurorehabilitation. However, the understanding of tDCS-induced alterations on the neuronal level is incomplete, and conclusions from young adults cannot be easily transferred to older populations. We used a systematic multimodal imaging approach to investigate the neurophysiological effects of tDCS in older adults and found stimulation-induced effects on GABA levels, reflecting augmented local plasticity and functional connectivity, suggesting modulation of network efficiency. Our findings may help to reconcile some of the recent reports on the variability of tDCS-induced effects, not only implicating age as a crucial modulating factor, but detailing its specific impact on the functionality of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extracellular Signals Induce Glycoprotein M6a Clustering of Lipid Rafts and Associated Signaling Molecules</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lipid raft domains, where sphingolipids and cholesterol are enriched, concentrate signaling molecules. To examine how signaling protein complexes are clustered in rafts, we focused on the functions of glycoprotein M6a (GPM6a), which is expressed at a high concentration in developing mouse neurons. Using imaging of lipid rafts, we found that GPM6a congregated in rafts in a GPM6a palmitoylation-dependent manner, thereby contributing to lipid raft clustering. In addition, we found that signaling proteins downstream of GPM6a, such as Rufy3, Rap2, and Tiam2/STEF, accumulated in lipid rafts in a GPM6a-dependent manner and were essential for laminin-dependent polarity during neurite formation in neuronal development. &lt;i&gt;In utero&lt;/i&gt; RNAi targeting of GPM6a resulted in abnormally polarized neurons with multiple neurites. These results demonstrate that GPM6a induces the clustering of lipid rafts, which supports the raft aggregation of its associated downstream molecules for acceleration of neuronal polarity determination. Therefore, GPM6a acts as a signal transducer that responds to extracellular signals.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Organization of Vestibulo-Ocular Responses in Abducens Motoneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4032?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) are the dominating contributors to gaze stabilization in all vertebrates. During horizontal head movements, abducens motoneurons form the final element of the reflex arc that integrates visuovestibular inputs into temporally precise motor commands for the lateral rectus eye muscle. Here, we studied a possible differentiation of abducens motoneurons into subtypes by evaluating their morphology, discharge properties, and synaptic pharmacology in semi-intact &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; preparations of larval &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt;. Extracellular nerve recordings during sinusoidal head motion revealed a continuum of resting rates and activation thresholds during vestibular stimulation. Differences in the sensitivity to changing stimulus frequencies and velocities allowed subdividing abducens motoneurons into two subgroups, one encoding the frequency and velocity of head motion (Group I), and the other precisely encoding angular velocity independent of stimulus frequency (Group II). Computational modeling indicated that Group II motoneurons are the major contributor to actual eye movements over the tested stimulus range. The segregation into two functional subgroups coincides with a differential activation of glutamate receptor subtypes. Vestibular excitatory inputs in Group I motoneurons are mediated predominantly by NMDA receptors and to a lesser extent by AMPA receptors, whereas an AMPA receptor-mediated excitation prevails in Group II motoneurons. Furthermore, glycinergic ipsilateral vestibular inhibitory inputs are activated during the horizontal VOR, whereas the tonic GABAergic inhibition is presumably of extravestibular origin. These findings support the presence of physiologically and pharmacologically distinct functional subgroups of extraocular motoneurons that act in concert to mediate the large dynamic range of extraocular motor commands during gaze stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Outward-directed gaze-stabilizing eye movements are commanded by abducens motoneurons that combine different sensory inputs including signals from the vestibular system about ongoing head movements (vestibulo-ocular reflex). Using an amphibian model, this study investigates whether different types of abducens motoneurons exist that become active during different types of eye movements. The outcome of this study demonstrates the presence of specific motoneuronal populations with pharmacological profiles that match their response dynamics. The evolutionary conservation of the vestibulo-ocular circuitry makes it likely that a similar motoneuronal organization is also implemented in other vertebrates. Accordingly, the physiological and pharmacological understanding of specific motoneuronal contributions to eye movements might help in designing drug therapies for human eye movement dysfunctions such as abducens nerve palsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Astrocytic LRP1 Mediates Brain A{beta} Clearance and Impacts Amyloid Deposition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4023?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulation and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain represent an early and perhaps necessary step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ accumulation leads to the formation of Aβ aggregates, which may directly and indirectly lead to eventual neurodegeneration. While Aβ production is accelerated in many familial forms of early-onset AD, increasing evidence indicates that impaired clearance of Aβ is more evident in late-onset AD. To uncover the mechanisms underlying impaired Aβ clearance in AD, we examined the role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in astrocytes. Although LRP1 has been shown to play critical roles in brain Aβ metabolism in neurons and vascular mural cells, its role in astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain responsible for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, remains unclear. Here, we show that astrocytic LRP1 plays a critical role in brain Aβ clearance. LRP1 knockdown in primary astrocytes resulted in decreased cellular Aβ uptake and degradation. In addition, silencing of LRP1 in astrocytes led to downregulation of several major Aβ-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteases MMP2, MMP9, and insulin-degrading enzyme. More important, conditional knock-out of the &lt;i&gt;Lrp1&lt;/i&gt; gene in astrocytes in the background of APP/PS1 mice impaired brain Aβ clearance, exacerbated Aβ accumulation, and accelerated amyloid plaque deposition without affecting its production. Together, our results demonstrate that astrocytic LRP1 plays an important role in Aβ metabolism and that restoring LRP1 expression and function in the brain could be an effective strategy to facilitate Aβ clearance and counter amyloid pathology in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Astrocytes represent a major cell type regulating brain homeostasis; however, their roles in brain clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) and underlying mechanism are not clear. In this study, we used both cellular models and conditional knock-out mouse models to address the role of a critical Aβ receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in astrocytes. We found that LRP1 in astrocytes plays a critical role in brain Aβ clearance by modulating several Aβ-degrading enzymes and cellular degradation pathways. Our results establish a critical role of astrocytic LRP1 in brain Aβ clearance and shed light on specific Aβ clearance pathways that may help to establish new targets for AD prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GABA Cells in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala Promote Cataplexy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/15/4007?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cataplexy is a hallmark of narcolepsy characterized by the sudden uncontrollable onset of muscle weakness or paralysis during wakefulness. It can occur spontaneously, but is typically triggered by positive emotions such as laughter. Although cataplexy was identified &amp;gt;130 years ago, its neural mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that a newly identified GABA circuit within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) promotes cataplexy. We used behavioral, electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and chemogenetic strategies to target and manipulate CeA activity selectively in narcoleptic (&lt;i&gt;orexin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice to determine its functional role in controlling cataplexy. First, we show that chemogenetic activation of the entire CeA produces a marked increase in cataplexy attacks. Then, we show that GABA cells within the CeA are responsible for mediating this effect. To manipulate GABA cells specifically, we developed a new mouse line that enables genetic targeting of GABA cells in &lt;i&gt;orexin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We found that chemogenetic activation of GABA CeA cells triggered a 253% increase in the number of cataplexy attacks without affecting their duration, suggesting that GABA cells play a functional role in initiating but not maintaining cataplexy. We show that GABA cell activation only promotes cataplexy attacks associated with emotionally rewarding stimuli, not those occurring spontaneously. However, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of GABA CeA cells does not prevent cataplexy, suggesting these cells are not required for initiating cataplexy attacks. Our results indicate that the CeA promotes cataplexy onset and that emotionally rewarding stimuli may trigger cataplexy by activating GABA cells in the CeA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although cataplexy has been closely linked to positive emotions for &amp;gt;130 years, the neural circuitry that underlies this relationship is poorly understood. Recent work suggests that the amygdala, a brain area important for processing emotion, may be part of this circuit. This study provides the first functional evidence to implicate GABA cells in the amygdala as regulators of cataplexy triggered by positive emotions and identifies the amygdala as the brain region important more for gating the entrance into rather than the exit from cataplexy. We also generated a new mouse model for studying GABA neurons in narcoleptic mice, which could serve as a useful tool for studying the neurobiological underpinnings of narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Narcolepsy is characterized by chronic sleepiness and cataplexy—sudden muscle paralysis triggered by strong, positive emotions. This condition is caused by a lack of orexin (hypocretin) signaling, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that mediate cataplexy. The amygdala regulates responses to rewarding stimuli and contains neurons active during cataplexy. In addition, lesions of the amygdala reduce cataplexy. Because GABAergic neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) target brainstem regions known to regulate muscle tone, we hypothesized that these cells promote emotion-triggered cataplexy. We injected adeno-associated viral vectors coding for Cre-dependent DREADDs or a control vector into the CeA of orexin knock-out mice crossed with vGAT-Cre mice, resulting in selective expression of the excitatory hM3 receptor or the inhibitory hM4 receptor in GABAergic neurons of the CeA. We measured sleep/wake behavior and cataplexy after injection of saline or the hM3/hM4 ligand clozapine&lt;i&gt;-N-&lt;/i&gt;oxide (CNO) under baseline conditions and under conditions that should elicit positive emotions. In mice expressing hM3, CNO approximately doubled the amount of cataplexy in the first 3 h after dosing under baseline conditions. Rewarding stimuli (chocolate or running wheels) also increased cataplexy, but CNO produced no further increase. In mice expressing hM4, CNO reduced cataplexy in the presence of chocolate or running wheels. These results demonstrate that GABAergic neurons of the CeA are sufficient and necessary for the production of cataplexy in mice, and they likely are a key part of the mechanism through which positive emotions trigger cataplexy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cataplexy is one of the major symptoms of narcolepsy, but little is known about how strong, positive emotions trigger these episodes of muscle paralysis. Prior research shows that amygdala neurons are active during cataplexy and cataplexy is reduced by lesions of the amygdala. We found that cataplexy is substantially increased by selective activation of GABAergic neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). We also demonstrate that inhibition of these neurons reduces reward-promoted cataplexy. These results build upon prior work to establish the CeA as a crucial element in the neural mechanisms of cataplexy. These results demonstrate the importance of the CeA in regulating responses to rewarding stimuli, shedding light on the broader neurobiology of emotions and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochastic Spike Synchronization in A Small-World Neural Network with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. (arXiv:1704.03150v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03150</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network consisting of subthreshold
neurons which exhibit noise-induced spikings. This neuronal network has
adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDP, stochastic spike
synchronization (SSS) between noise-induced spikings of subthreshold neurons
was found to occur in a range of intermediate noise intensities through
competition between the constructive and the destructive roles of noise. Here,
we investigate the effect of additive STDP on the SSS by varying the noise
intensity. Occurrence of a &quot;Matthew&quot; effect in synaptic plasticity is found due
to a positive feedback process. As a result, good synchronization gets better
via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad
synchronization gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Emergence of LTP and
LTD of synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via microscopic studies
based on the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IISRs
(instantaneous individual spike rates) as well as the distributions of time
delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times. Furthermore, the
effects of multiplicative STDP (which depends on the states) on the SSS are
also studied and discussed in comparison with the case of additive STDP.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural-like computing with populations of superparamagnetic basis functions. (arXiv:1610.09394v3 [cs.ET] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, population coding theory has demonstrated that
fault-tolerant information processing can be achieved by neural assemblies.
Transposed to nanoelectronics, this strategy could allow computing reliably
with ultimately scaled-down, noisy, imperfect devices. This approach requires
that the response functions to inputs of the population components form a set
of basis functions, thus offering a physical substrate for calculating. For
this purpose, the nanodevice responses should be non-linear, and each tuned to
different values of the input. These strong requirements have until now
prevented a demonstration of population coding with nanodevices. Here we show
that nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can be assembled to exhibit such
neural-like ensemble responses. We demonstrate experimentally that a population
of nine junctions can implement a basis set of functions, allowing, for
instance, the generation of cursive letters. Through simulations, we show that
systems based on interlinked populations of junctions can learn to realize low
power, variability-resilient non-linear transformations through population
coding.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Acute transient cognitive dysfunction and acute brain injury induced by systemic inflammation occur by dissociable IL-1-dependent mechanisms</title>

	<description>Systemic inflammation can impair cognition with relevance to dementia, delirium and post-operative cognitive dysfunction. Acute episodes of delirium also contribute significantly to rates of long-term cognitive decline, implying that de novo pathology occurs during these acute episodes. Whether systemic inflammation-induced acute dysfunction and acute brain injury occur by overlapping or discrete mechanisms has not been investigated. Here we show that systemic inflammation, induced by bacterial LPS, produces both working memory deficits and acute brain injury in the degenerating brain and that these occur by dissociable IL-1-dependent processes. In normal C57BL/6 mice, LPS (100 g/kg) did not affect working memory but robustly impaired contextual fear conditioning (CFC). However prior hippocampal synaptic loss left mice selectively vulnerable to LPS-induced working memory deficits. Systemically administered IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was protective against, and systemic IL-1 beta; replicated, these working memory deficits. Although LPS-induced deficits still occured in IL-1RI-/- mice, systemic TNF-alpha; was sufficient to induce similar deficits, indicating redundancy among these cytokines. Dexamethasone abolished systemic cytokine synthesis and was protective against working memory deficits despite failing to block brain IL-1 beta; synthesis. Direct application of IL-1 beta; to ex vivo hippocampal slices induced non-synaptic depolarisation and irrevesible loss of membrane potential in CA1 neurons from diseased animals and systemic LPS increased apoptosis in the degenerating brain, in an IL-1RI-/- dependent-fashion. The data suggest that LPS induces working memory dysfunction via circulating IL-1 beta; but dysfunction leading to neuronal death is mediated by hippocampal IL-1 beta;. The data suggest that acute systemic inflammation produces both reversible cognitive deficits, resembling delirium, and acute brain injury that may lead to long-term cognitive impairment but that these events are mechanistically dissociable. This would have significant implications for management of cognitive dysfunction and decline during acute illness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Adolescent Tuning Of Association Cortex In Human Structural Brain Networks</title>

	<description>How does human brain organization change over the course of adolescence? Motivated by prior data on local cortical shrinkage and intracortical myelination, we predicted age-related changes in topological organisation of cortical structural networks. We estimated the structural correlation matrix from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cortical thickness at 308 regions in a sample of N=297 healthy participants, aged 14-24 years (inclusive). We used a novel sliding-window analysis to measure age-related changes in network attributes globally, locally and in the context of several community partitions of the network. We found that the strength of structural correlation generally decreased as a function of age. Association cortical regions demonstrated a sharp decrease in nodal degree (hubness) from 14 years, reaching a minimum at approximately 19 years, and then levelling off or even slightly increasing until 24 years. Greater and more prolonged age-related changes in degree of cortical regions within the brain network were associated with faster rates of adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage. The brain regions that demonstrated the greatest age-related changes were concentrated within prefrontal modules. We conclude that human adolescence is associated with biologically plausible changes in structural imaging markers of brain network organization, consistent with the concept of tuning or consolidating anatomical connectivity between frontal cortex and the rest of the connectome.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stereotypical Modulations In Dynamic Functional Connectivity Explained By Changes In BOLD Variance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126524v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126524v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Spontaneous activity measured in human subject under the absence of any task exhibits complex patterns of correlation that largely correspond to large-scale functional topographies obtained with a wide variety of cognitive and perceptual tasks. These &quot;resting state networks&quot; (RSNs) fluctuate over time, forming and dissolving on the scale of seconds to minutes. While these fluctuations, most prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether they index a non-stationary process which could be described as state switching. In this study, we use a sliding windows approach to relate temporal dynamics of RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal. We find that many properties of the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average FC structure. However, we also encounter interesting characteristics that are not explained in this way. In particular, we find that the brain spends more time in the peaks and troughs of modulations than can be expected from stationary dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Assessing the role of inhibition in stabilizing neocortical networks requires large-scale perturbation of the inhibitory population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/123950v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neurons within cortical microcircuits are densely interconnected by recurrent excitatory synaptic connections that are thought to amplify signals (Douglas and Martin, 2007), form selective subnetworks (Ko et al., 2011) and aid feature discrimination. Strong inhibition (Haider et al., 2013) counterbalances excitation, enabling sensory features to be sharpened and represented by sparse codes (Willmore et al., 2011). This &quot;balance&quot; of excitation and inhibition has made it difficult to assess the strength, or gain, of the recurrent excitatory connections within cortical networks, which is key to understanding their operational regime and the computations they can perform. Networks of neurons that combine an unstable high-gain excitatory population with stabilising inhibitory feedback are known as inhibition-stabilized networks (ISNs; Tsodyks et al. 1997). Classical theoretical studies using reduced network models predict that ISNs produce paradoxical responses to perturbation, but in vivo optogenetic perturbations have failed to find evidence for ISNs in cortex (Atallah et al., 2012). We re-examined this question by investigating how rate-based and spiking cortical network models consisting of many neurons behave following perturbations, and found that results obtained from reduced network models fail to predict the effects of perturbations in more realistic networks. Our cortical network models predict that a large proportion of the inhibitory network must be perturbed in order to robustly detect an ISN regime in cortex. We propose that optogenetic suppression of inhibition under a promoter targeting all inhibitory neurons, coupled with wide-field illumination, may provide a sufficient perturbation to reveal the operating regime of cortex. Our results suggest that detailed computational models of optogenetic perturbations are necessary to interpret the results of experimental paradigms.</description>

	<description>Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and/or hepatitis B and C viruses are risk factors for human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Available evidence supports the interpretation that formation of AFB1-DNA adducts in hepatocytes seeds a population of mutations, mainly G:C→T:A, and viral processes synergize to accelerate tumorigenesis, perhaps via inflammation. Responding to a need...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/gdLgakjaPEU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Metabolism mediates the flow of matter and energy through the biosphere. We examined how metabolic evolution shapes ecosystems by reconstructing it in the globally abundant oceanic phytoplankter Prochlorococcus. To understand what drove observed evolutionary patterns, we interpreted them in the context of its population dynamics, growth rate, and light adaptation,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/VEHoiSqZuUw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed a global downregulation of gray matter [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26 ± 26% (mean ± standard deviation) at 3 to 4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-α in blood displayed a reduction (41 ± 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These findings may be related to postsurgical impairments of cognitive function. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Message passing between components of a distributed physical system is
non-instantaneous and contributes to determine the time scales of the emerging
collective dynamics like an effective inertia. In biological neuron networks
this inertia is due in part to local synaptic filtering of exchanged spikes,
and in part to the distribution of the axonal transmission delays. How
differently these two kinds of inertia affect the network dynamics is an open
issue not yet addressed due to the difficulties in dealing with the
non-Markovian nature of synaptic transmission. Here, we develop a mean-field
dimensional reduction yielding to an effective Markovian dynamics of the
population density of the neuronal membrane potential, valid under the
hypothesis of small fluctuations of the synaptic current. The resulting theory
allows us to prove the formal equivalence between local and distributed
inertia, holding for any synaptic time scale, integrate-and-fire neuron model,
spike emission regimes and for different network states even when the neuron
number is finite.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Avalanches and Generalized Memory Associativity in a Network Model for Conscious and Unconscious Mental Functioning. (arXiv:1704.02741v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02741</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02741</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore statistical characteristics of avalanches associated with the
dynamics of a complex-network model, where two modules corresponding to
sensorial and symbolic memories interact, representing unconscious and
conscious mental processes. The model illustrates Freud's ideas regarding the
neuroses and that consciousness is related with symbolic and linguistic memory
activity in the brain. It incorporates the Stariolo-Tsallis generalization of
the Boltzmann Machine in order to model memory retrieval and associativity. In
the present work, we define and measure avalanche size distributions during
memory retrieval, in order to gain insight regarding basic aspects of the
functioning of these complex networks. The avalanche sizes defined for our
model should be related to the time consumed and also to the size of the
neuronal region which is activated, during memory retrieval. This allows the
qualitative comparison of the behaviour of the distribution of cluster sizes,
obtained during fMRI measurements of the propagation of signals in the brain,
with the distribution of avalanche sizes obtained in our simulation
experiments. This comparison corroborates the indication that the Nonextensive
Statistical Mechanics formalism may indeed be more well suited to model the
complex networks which constitute brain and mental structure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is among the most salient of experiences while also, curiously, being
among the most malleable. A large body of research has revealed that a
multitude of explicit strategies can be used to effectively alter the
attention-demanding quality of acute and chronic pains and their associated
neural correlates. However, thoughts that are spontaneous, rather than actively
generated, are common in daily life, and so attention to pain can often
temporally fluctuate because of ongoing self-generated experiences. Classic
pain theories have largely neglected to account for unconstrained fluctuations
in cognition, but new studies have demonstrated the behavioral-relevance,
putative neural basis, and individual variability of interactions between pain
and spontaneous thoughts. In this chapter, I review behavioral studies of
ongoing fluctuations in attention to pain, studies of the neural basis of
spontaneous mind-wandering away from pain, and the clinical implications of
this research.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study proposes an approach to estimate the functional localization and
connectivity from CBF and BOLD signals simultaneously measured by ASL (arterial
spin labeling) MRI, especially using exploratory Structural Equation Modeling
analysis. In a visual task experiment, the primary visual cortices were located
by analyzing the perfusion data. In the resting state experiment, two
structural equation models were estimated at each voxel regarding to the
sensory-motor network and default-mode network. The resulting connectivity maps
indicate that supplementary motor area has significant connections to
left/right primary motor areas, and inferior parietal lobules link
significantly with posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. The
model fitting results imply that BOLD signal is more directly linked to the
underlying cause of functional connectivity than CBF signal.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An often-overlooked characteristic of the human mind is its propensity to
wander. Despite growing interest in the science of mind-wandering, most studies
operationalize mind-wandering by its task-unrelated contents, which may be
orthogonal to the processes constraining how thoughts are evoked and unfold
over time. In this chapter, we emphasize the importance of incorporating such
processes into current definitions of mind-wandering, and proposing that
mind-wandering and other forms of spontaneous thought (such as dreaming and
creativity) are mental states that arise and transition relatively freely due
to an absence of constraints on cognition. We review existing psychological,
philosophical, and neuroscientific research on spontaneous thought through the
lens of this framework, and call for additional research into the dynamic
properties of the mind and brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02351</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization in neural networks is strongly tied to the implementation of
cognitive processes, but abnormal neuronal synchronization has been linked to a
number of brain disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Here we examine
the effects of channel noise on the synchronization of small Hodgkin-Huxley
neuronal networks. The principal feature of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is the
existence of protein channels that transition between open and closed states
with voltage dependent rate constants. The Hodgkin-Huxley model assumes
infinitely many channels, so fluctuations in the number of open channels do not
affect the voltage. However, real neurons have finitely many channels which
lead to fluctuations in the membrane voltage and modify the timing of the
spikes, which may in turn lead to large changes in the degree of
synchronization. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, neurons in the
network reach a steady state synchronization level that depends only on the
number of neurons in the network. The channel noise only affects the time it
takes to reach the steady state synchronization level.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep paralysis is an experience of being temporarily unable to move or talk
during the transitional periods between sleep and wakefulness: at sleep onset
or upon awakening. Feeling of paralysis may be accompanied by a variety of
vivid and intense sensory experiences, including mentation in visual, auditory,
and tactile modalities, as well as a distinct feeling of presence. This chapter
discusses a variety of sleep paralysis experiences from the perspective of
enactive cognition and cultural neurophenomenology. Current knowledge of
neurophysiology and associated conditions is presented, and some techniques for
coping with sleep paralysis are proposed. As an experience characterized by a
hybrid state of dreaming and waking, sleep paralysis offers a unique window
into phenomenology of spontaneous thought in sleep.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has led to significant advances in artificial intelligence, in
part, by adopting strategies motivated by neurophysiology. However, it is
unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that
a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us
to understand how the brain optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical
pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and
higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to
this segregation, the neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate
synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network can learn to categorize
images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our
algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful
representations---the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that
deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which
may help to explain the dendritic morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126763v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The notion that sensitivity to the statistical structure of the environment is pivotal to perception has recently garnered considerable attention. Here we investigated this issue in the context of hearing. Building on previous work (Sohoglu &amp;amp; Chait, 2016b), stimuli were artificial  sound-scapes populated by multiple (up to 14) simultaneous sources  comprised of tone-pip sequences, each with a distinct frequency and temporal pattern. Sequences were either temporally regular or random. Listeners ability to detect abrupt appearance or disappearance of a source is facilitated when scene sources were characterized by a temporally regular fluctuation pattern. The patterning of the changing source as well as that of the background (non-changing) sources contribute independently to this effect. Remarkably, listeners benefit from regularity even when they are not consciously aware of it. These findings establish that perception of acoustic scenes relies on the availability of detailed representations of regularities automatically extracted from each scene source.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126649v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Both the lateral and the central nuclei of the amygdala are required for adaptive behavioral responses to environmental cues predicting threats. While experience-driven synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala is thought to underlie the formation of association between a sensory stimulus and an ensuing threat, how the central amygdala participates in such learning process remains unclear. Here we show that a specific class of central amygdala neurons, the protein kinase C-{delta}-expressing neurons, is essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the lateral amygdala, as it is required for lateral amygdala neurons to respond to unconditioned stimulus, and furthermore carries information about the unconditioned stimulus to instruct learning. Our results uncover an amygdala functional organization that may play a key role in diverse learning processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The influence of Parkinson's disease and neurotypical aging on cognitive performance among volunteers for an exercise-based rehabilitative intervention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126607v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126607v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>PURPOSE: To determine the impact of aging versus combined aging and disease on cognition in older adults with and without Parkinson's disease (PD) who were volunteers for exercise based rehabilitation research. METHODS: We used a multiple linear regression approach to analyze cognitive outcome measures of rehabilitation volunteers with and without PD. RESULTS: Significant associations were identified between increased age and decreased performance on 8 of the 14 outcomes analyzed after controlling for false discovery rate. Of those 8 outcomes, multivariate regression analyses demonstrated an effect of disease on performance in only 4 / 8. In all cases, PD was associated with superior, rather than decreased performance after controlling for age. Results were unaffected by sex and education. Post-hoc comparison with available age norms demonstrated that differences between PD and Non-PD volunteers could be primarily attributed to the Non-PD group substantially underperforming versus age norms. CONCLUSIONS: In rehabilitative exercise studies using volunteers, many cognitive domains decline with increasing age, consistent with previous neuropsychological studies without a rehabilitation component. However, older &quot;neurotypical&quot; volunteers may potentially underperform PD volunteers after controlling for age. This may be an important design consideration for rehabilitation studies with cognitive outcomes.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126490v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The present study examined whether a cognitive process model that is inferred based on group data holds, and is meaningful, at the level of the individual person. Investigation of this issue is tantamount to questioning that the same set and configuration of cognitive processes is present within all individuals, a usually untested assumption in standard group-based experiments. Search from memory as assessed with the Sternberg memory scanning paradigm is among the most widely studied phenomena in cognitive psychology. According to the original memory scanning model, search is serial and exhaustive. Here we critically examined the validity of this model across individuals and practice. 32 younger adults completed 1488 trials of the Sternberg task distributed over eight sessions. In the first session, group data followed the pattern predicted by the original model, replicating earlier findings. However, data from the first session were not sufficiently reliable for identifying whether each individual complied with the serial exhaustive search model. In sessions six to eight, when participants performed near asymptotic levels of performance, between-person differences were reliable, group data deviated substantially from the original memory search model, and the model fit only 13 of the 32 participants' data. Our findings challenge the proposition that one general memory search process exists within a group of healthy younger adults, and questions the testability of this proposition at the individual level in single-session experiments. Implications for cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience are discussed with reference to earlier work emphasizing the explicit consideration of potentially existent individual differences.</description>

	<description>Brain development is a dynamic process that follows a choreographed trajectory during childhood and adolescence with tissue-specific alterations that reflect complex and ongoing biological processes. Accurate identification and modelling of these anatomical processes in vivo with MRI may provide clinically useful imaging markers of individual variability in development. In this study, we build a model of age- and sex-related anatomical variation using multimodal imaging measures and manifold learning. Using publicly-available data from two large, independent developmental cohorts (n=768 and 862), we apply a multimodal machine learning approach combining measures of tissue volume, cortical area and cortical thickness into a low-dimensional data representation. We find that neuroanatomical variation due to age and sex can be captured by two orthogonal patterns of brain development and we use this model to predict age with a mean error of 1.6-2 years and sex with an accuracy of 80-84%. We present a framework for modelling anatomical development during childhood using low-dimensional data representations. This model accurately predicts age and sex based on image-derived markers of cerebral morphology and generalises well to independent populations.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling disordered protein interactions from biophysical principles</title>

Disordered protein-protein interactions (PPIs), those involving a folded protein and an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), are prevalent in the cell, including important signaling and regulatory pathways. IDPs do not adopt a single dominant structure in isolation but often become ordered upon binding. To aid understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disordered PPIs, it is crucial to obtain the tertiary structure of the PPIs. However, experimental methods have difficulty in solving disordered PPIs and existing protein-protein and protein-peptide docking methods are not able to model them. Here we present a novel computational method, IDP-LZerD, which models the conformation of a disordered PPI by considering the biophysical binding mechanism of an IDP to a structured protein, whereby a local segment of the IDP initiates the interaction and subsequently the remaining IDP regions explore and coalesce around the initial binding site. On a dataset of 22 disordered PPIs with IDPs up to 69 amino acids, successful predictions were made for 21 bound and 18 unbound receptors. The successful modeling provides additional support for biophysical principles. Moreover, the new technique significantly expands the capability of protein structure modeling and provides crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms of disordered PPIs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MUyvfhHHVgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Amino acid composition predicts prion activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005465</guid>

Many prion-forming proteins contain glutamine/asparagine (Q/N) rich domains, and there are conflicting opinions as to the role of primary sequence in their conversion to the prion form: is this phenomenon driven primarily by amino acid composition, or, as a recent computational analysis suggested, dependent on the presence of short sequence elements with high amyloid-forming potential. The argument for the importance of short sequence elements hinged on the relatively-high accuracy obtained using a method that utilizes a collection of length-six sequence elements with known amyloid-forming potential. We weigh in on this question and demonstrate that when those sequence elements are permuted, even higher accuracy is obtained; we also propose a novel multiple-instance machine learning method that uses sequence composition alone, and achieves better accuracy than all existing prion prediction approaches. While we expect there to be elements of primary sequence that affect the process, our experiments suggest that sequence composition alone is sufficient for predicting protein sequences that are likely to form prions. A web-server for the proposed method is available at http://faculty.pieas.edu.pk/fayyaz/prank.html, and the code for reproducing our experiments is available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.167136.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rL8SH_vmJu0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of advances in the pathology, genetics and imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there remain no effective treatments that significantly alter its natural history. Several late phase clinical trials, focused largely on amyloid beta metabolism and clearance, have unfortunately demonstrated no significant benefit in early AD patients. Recent work investigating blood-brain barrier opening using focused ultrasound in transgenic animal models has shown that repeated ultrasound administration coupled with microbubble-containing contrast can reduce plaque burden and reverse memory deficits. While the mechanisms underlying plaque clearance are under investigation, this image-guided, noninvasive technique appears promising. This article describes the rationale and underlying principles of focused ultrasound as applied to Alzheimer's disease and suggests that based on promising pre-clinical results, this technology, whether alone or in conjunction with targeted therapies, can be of potential benefit.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At one month post-injury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at one month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1 year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mutation in the Tubb4a gene leads to microtubule accumulation with hypomyelination and demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Our goal was to define the genetic cause of the profound hypomyelination in the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat model and determine its relevance to human white matter disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Based on previous localization of the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; mutation to rat chromosome 9, we tested if the mutation resided within the &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (β-tubulin 4A) gene, since mutations in the &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; gene have been described in patients with CNS hypomyelination. To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2 year old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and MRI evidence of severe hypomyelination was studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: As the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat ages there is progressive loss of myelin in the brain and dorsal column of the spinal cord associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers with accumulation of microtubules. This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat is the first animal model of &lt;em&gt;TUBB4&lt;/em&gt; mutations in humans and a novel system in which to test the mechanism of microtubule accumulation. The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain must robustly store a large number of memories, corresponding to
the many events and scenes a person encounters over a lifetime. However, the
number of memory states in existing neural network models either grows weakly
with network size or recall performance fails catastrophically with vanishingly
little noise. Here we show that it is possible to construct an associative
content-addressable memory (ACAM) with exponentially many stable states and
robust error-correction. The network possesses expander graph connectivity on a
restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. The expansion property allows simple
neural network dynamics to perform at par with modern error-correcting codes.
Appropriate networks can be constructed with sparse random connections combined
with glomerular nodes and a local associative learning rule, using low
dynamic-range weights. Thus, sparse quasi-random constraint structures --
characteristic of an important class of modern error-correcting codes -- may
provide for high-performance computation in artificial neural networks and the
brain.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dose-response relationships for environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005481</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew F. Brouwer, Mark H. Weir, Marisa C. Eisenberg, Rafael Meza, Joseph N. S. Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models provide a mechanistic approach to examining environmental interventions for outbreaks, such as water treatment or surface decontamination. The shift from the classical SIR framework to one incorporating the environment requires codifying the relationship between exposure to environmental pathogens and infection, i.e. the dose–response relationship. Much of the work characterizing the functional forms of dose–response relationships has used statistical fit to experimental data. However, there has been little research examining the consequences of the choice of functional form in the context of transmission dynamics. To this end, we identify four properties of dose–response functions that should be considered when selecting a functional form: low-dose linearity, scalability, concavity, and whether it is a single-hit model. We find that i) middle- and high-dose data do not constrain the low-dose response, and different dose–response forms that are equally plausible given the data can lead to significant differences in simulated outbreak dynamics; ii) the choice of how to aggregate continuous exposure into discrete doses can impact the modeled force of infection; iii) low-dose linear, concave functions allow the basic reproduction number to control global dynamics; and iv) identifiability analysis offers a way to manage multiple sources of uncertainty and leverage environmental monitoring to make inference about infectivity. By applying an environmentally mediated infectious disease model to the 1993 Milwaukee &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; outbreak, we demonstrate that environmental monitoring allows for inference regarding the infectivity of the pathogen and thus improves our ability to identify outbreak characteristics such as pathogen strain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Jzgkl6SGBws&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rigorous spatial statistics for gaze patterns in scene viewing: Effects of repeated viewing. (arXiv:1704.01761v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01761</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01761</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scene viewing is used to study attentional selection in complex but still
controlled environments. One of the main observations on eye movements during
scene viewing is the inhomogeneous distribution of fixation locations: While
some parts of an image are fixated by almost all observers and are inspected
repeatedly by the same observer, other image parts remain unfixated among
observers even after long exploration intervals. Here, we apply spatial point
processes to investigate the correlations between pairs of points. More
technically, the pair correlation function (PCF) is a powerful statistical tool
to evaluate how individual scanpaths deviate from the inhomogeneity observed
across participants. We demonstrate that aggregation of fixation locations
within four degrees is stronger during individual trials than expected by the
inhomogeneity of the distribution. Furthermore, the PCF reveals stronger
aggregation of fixations when the same image is presented a second time. We use
simulations of a dynamical model to show that a reduced attentional span may
explain differences in spatial correlations between first and second inspection
of the same image.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Conserved Ising Model on the Human Connectome. (arXiv:1509.02697v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02697</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02697</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamical models implemented on the large scale architecture of the human
brain may shed light on how function arises from the underlying structure. This
is the case notably for simple abstract models, such as the Ising model. We
compare the spin correlations of the Ising model and the empirical functional
brain correlations, both at the single link level and at the modular level, and
show that their match increases at the modular level in anesthesia, in line
with recent results and theories. Moreover, we show that at the peak of the
specific heat (the \it{critical state}) the spin correlations are minimally
shaped by the underlying structural network, explaining how the best match
between structure and function is obtained at the onset of criticality, as
previously observed. These findings confirm that brain dynamics under
anesthesia shows a departure from criticality and could open the way to novel
perspectives when the conserved magnetization is interpreted in terms of an
homeostatic principle imposed to neural activity.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this article was to evaluate in normal older adults and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) the impact of amyloid and regional tauopathy on cerebral glucose metabolism and subsequent memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We acquired positron emission tomography using F18 flortaucipir (tau), C11 Pittsburgh compound B (amyloid), and F18 fluorodeoxyglucose in 90 clinically normal elderly of the Harvard Aging Brain Study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posterior cingulate metabolism decreased when both amyloid and neocortical tau were high and predicted subsequent memory decline in a larger sample of normal elderly. In contrast, frontal hypometabolism related to the common age-related entorhinal tauopathy, but this dysfunction was independent of amyloid, and did not predict significant memory decline. Neocortical tauopathy was positively associated with metabolism in individuals with subthreshold amyloid, suggesting that glucose metabolism increases before decreasing in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study identified a synergistic effect of amyloid and tau deposits and demonstrated, for the first time, in normal elderly its link to AD-like hypometabolism and to AD-like memory decline. The amyloid effect was observed with tau in neocortex, but not with tau in entorhinal cortex, which is the common site of age-related tauopathy. Entorhinal tau was associated with frontal hypometabolism, but this dysfunction was not associated with memory loss. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess the possibility of using a noninvasive screening method for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis by means of abdominal fat ultrasonography. Quantitative analysis of ultrasound B-mode images demonstrated a significant increase in mean echogenicity and a loss of the normal structure of the layers of fat tissue in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (n = 19). The ultrasound features of the fat tissue and the degree of amyloid deposition seen histopathologically showed a significant correlation. These results suggest that abdominal fat ultrasonography may be a valuable method for screening for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Comment on &quot;Biologically inspired protection of deep networks from adversarial attacks&quot;. (arXiv:1704.01547v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent paper suggests that Deep Neural Networks can be protected from
gradient-based adversarial perturbations by driving the network activations
into a highly saturated regime. Here we analyse such saturated networks and
show that the attacks fail due to numerical limitations in the gradient
computations. A simple stabilisation of the gradient estimates enables
successful and efficient attacks. Thus, it has yet to be shown that the
robustness observed in highly saturated networks is not simply due to numerical
limitations.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to KCNC1 mutation: Analysis of 20 cases and K+ channel properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed clinical, electroclinical and neuroimaging data for twenty patients with MEAK due to recurrent KCNC1 p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms began between 3-15 years (median 9.5) with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic-clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; ten patients were wheelchair-bound by late teenage. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. EEG showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG-EMG studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking co-activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. MRI revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, that appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in six patients. To explore this, we performed high temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures there was a robust left-shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 increasing channel availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation resembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent left-shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 subunit containing channels that would counter the loss-of-function observed for mutant channels, highlighting KCNC1 as a potential target for precision therapeutics.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized clinical trial of deep brain stimulation for post-stroke pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24927</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24927</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The experience with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for pain is largely based on uncontrolled studies targeting the somatosensory pathways, with mixed results. We hypothesized that targeting limbic neural pathways would modulate the affective sphere of pain and alleviate suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of DBS targeting the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule (VS/ALIC) in 10 patients with post-stroke pain syndrome. One month after bilateral DBS, patients were randomized to active DBS or sham for 3 months, followed by cross-over for another 3-month period. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50% improvement in the Pain Disability Index in 50% of patients with active DBS compared to sham. This 6-month blinded phase was followed by an 18-month open-stimulation phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Nine participants completed randomization. Although this trial was negative for its primary and secondary endpoints, we did observe significant differences in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain (e.g. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Affective Pain Rating Index of the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire). 14 serious adverse events were recorded and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: VS/ALIC DBS to modulate the affective sphere of pain represents a paradigm shift in chronic pain management. While this exploratory study was negative for its primary endpoint, VS/ALIC DBS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and statistically-significant improvements in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain. Therefore, we believe these results justify further work in neuromodulation therapies targeting the affective sphere of pain. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tailoring epilepsy surgery with fast ripples in the intra-operative electrocorticogram</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) can be used to delineate the resection area in epilepsy surgery. High frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and post-resection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs, 250-500Hz) and ripples (80-250Hz), and spikes in pre- and post-resection ECoG sampled at 2048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of EEG-event occurrence: pre+post- (+/-), pre+post+ (+/+), pre-post+ (-/+) and pre-post- (-/-). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement, lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG-events, the time to recurrence and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free versus recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We included 54 patients (median age 15.5y, 25 months follow-up, 30 seizure-free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/-,+/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio: 3.13 (CI=1.22-6.25); p=0.01). Seven out of eight patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure-free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was the presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: FRs which persists before and after resection predict poor post-surgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intra-operative ECoG measurements. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mesoscale Architecture Shapes Initiation and Richness of Spontaneous Network Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3972?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3972?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous activity in the absence of external input, including propagating waves of activity, is a robust feature of neuronal networks &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The neurophysiological and anatomical requirements for initiation and persistence of such activity, however, are poorly understood, as is their role in the function of neuronal networks. Computational network studies indicate that clustered connectivity may foster the generation, maintenance, and richness of spontaneous activity. Since this mesoscale architecture cannot be systematically modified in intact tissue, testing these predictions is impracticable &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigate how the mesoscale structure shapes spontaneous activity in generic networks of rat cortical neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In these networks, neurons spontaneously arrange into local clusters with high neurite density and form fasciculating long-range axons. We modified this structure by modulation of protein kinase C, an enzyme regulating neurite growth and cell migration. Inhibition of protein kinase C reduced neuronal aggregation and fasciculation of axons, i.e., promoted uniform architecture. Conversely, activation of protein kinase C promoted aggregation of neurons into clusters, local connectivity, and bundling of long-range axons. Supporting predictions from theory, clustered networks were more spontaneously active and generated diverse activity patterns. Neurons within clusters received stronger synaptic inputs and displayed increased membrane potential fluctuations. Intensified clustering promoted the initiation of synchronous bursting events but entailed incomplete network recruitment. Moderately clustered networks appear optimal for initiation and propagation of diverse patterns of activity. Our findings support a crucial role of the mesoscale architectures in the regulation of spontaneous activity dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Computational studies predict richer and persisting spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneous activity in neuronal networks with neuron clustering. To test this, we created networks of varying architecture &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Supporting these predictions, the generation and spatiotemporal patterns of propagation were most variable in networks with intermediate clustering and lowest in uniform networks. Grid-like clustering, on the other hand, facilitated spontaneous activity but led to degenerating patterns of propagation. Neurons outside clusters had weaker synaptic input than neurons within clusters, in which increased membrane potential fluctuations facilitated the initiation of synchronized spike activity. Our results thus show that the intermediate level organization of neuronal networks strongly influences the dynamics of their activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

	<description>Grima et al. describe a new fundamental defect in nucleocytoplasmic transport in Huntington’s disease using multiple model systems and independent lines of evidence. This defect can be mitigated with agents that alter nuclear pore complex O-GlcNAcylation and/or transport functions.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30204-0?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Jiang et al. demonstrate that odor elicits theta activity within human piriform cortex. Additionally, the time-frequency dynamics of piriform can decode odor content within the first few hundred milliseconds of sampling. Finally, presence of odor promotes piriform-hippocampal theta phase locking.</description>

	<description>Temkin et al. demonstrate that the endosomal sorting complex, the retromer, is required for delivery of AMPA receptors during LTP. As retromer malfunction is linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, this finding has implications for understanding the pathophysiology of these common neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Hamm et al. studied sensory cortical populations in two established mouse models of schizophrenia pathophysiology and risk, chronic ketamine and Df(16)A+/−. They identify a disorganization of neuronal ensembles, distinct from alterations in neuronal or global activity levels or pairwise correlations, that could constitute the common pathophysiology of the disease.</description>

They are also frequently observed after acute ischemic stroke (AIS), indicating poor functional outcome and increased mortality. However, recent evidence showed that, in most AIS patients, myocardial injury is not caused by coronary ischemia. Instead, stroke lesion location has been suggested to precipitate myocardial injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was used in 299 patients who had a magnetic resonance imaging–confirmed acute ischemic stroke within the anterior circulation and a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) acquired on the day of admission. Of these, 228 had a second troponin measurement during the acute phase. The absolute hs-cTnT levels above the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population (≥14ng/l) as well as their relative temporal changes were used as continuous variables of interest in the VLSM model, including a multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insular cortex of the right hemisphere, in particular its dorsal subregion, was significantly associated with the relative temporal changes of hs-cTnT (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, the baseline hs-cTnT levels on admission were not related to lesion location anywhere within the anterior circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results amplify recent evidence from functional neuroimaging, which suggests a prominent role of dorsal anterior insular cortex in the parasympathetic control of cardiac and autonomic function. Acute vascular damage of this insular subregion might lead to autonomic dysbalance and an upregulation of sympathetic function, thereby resulting in myocardial injury.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathomechanisms of anti–cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A autoantibodies in sporadic inclusion body myositis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), an intractable progressive muscle disease, frequently occurs in older persons. sIBM pathogenesis may involve protein degradation dysfunction and immune abnormalities. Autoantibodies recognizing cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) were found in plasma and serum from sIBM patients. However, whether anti-cN1A autoantibodies play a pathogenic role in sIBM is controversial. This study investigated the pathogenic properties of anti-cN1A autoantibodies in sIBM pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a cell-based assay to detect anti-cN1A autoantibodies, which we found in serum from patients with neuromuscular diseases including sIBM. We also investigated the clinicopathological differences between sIBM patients with and without the autoantibodies. We used passive in vitro and in vivo immunization models to evaluate the pathogenic role of the autoantibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 67 patients with sIBM, 24 (35.8%) possessed anti-cN1A autoantibodies as determined via our cell-based assay. In the anti-cN1A–positive group, the percentage of patients with hepatitis C virus antibodies was significantly lower and the mean area of type 2 myofibers was significantly smaller compared with the autoantibody-negative group. In the in vitro passive immunization model, p62/SQSTM1 significantly increased in anti-cN1A–positive sIBM immunoglobulin G (IgG)-supplemented cells. In the in vivo passive immunization model, anti-cN1A–positive sIBM IgG-injected mice demonstrated p62/SQSTM1-positive sarcoplasmic aggregates in myofibers, associated with macrophage infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our cell-based assay is useful for anti-cN1A autoantibodies detection. Patients with anti-cN1A autoantibodies demonstrated unique clinicopathological features. In vitro and in vivo passive immunization model results suggest that anti-cN1A autoantibodies may affect protein degradation in myofibers. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Homozygous mutations in VAMP1 cause a presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 families with undiagnosed recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Whole exome or genome sequencing identified segregating homozygous variants in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;: c.51_64delAGGTGGGGGTCCCC in a Kuwaiti family and c.146G&amp;gt;C in an Israeli family. &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; is crucial for vesicle fusion at presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Electrodiagnostic examination showed severely low compound muscle action potentials and presynaptic impairment. We assessed the effect of the nonsense mutation on mRNA levels and evaluated the NMJ transmission in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;lew/lew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, observing neurophysiological features of presynaptic impairment, similar to the patients. Taken together, our findings highlight &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; homozygous mutations as a cause of presynaptic CMS. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Kristina Valentinova &amp;amp; Manuel Mameli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addictive substances hijack the reward system partly via synaptic plasticity onto dopamine neurons. Cadherins may contribute to cocaine-evoked adaptations, supporting the notion that drug addiction is a synaptic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are traditionally thought to represent locations where animals currently are or predict where they are headed. However, new results reveal that place cells also represent distant places that are actively avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily Regulate Synapse Formation, Maintenance, and Function</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30032-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Albouy et al. show that driving brain oscillations with rhythmic stimulation can specifically improve auditory working memory performance and modulate brain activity and connectivity patterns. These findings suggest that oscillations can serve as targets for controlled interventions into brain function.</description>

	<description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans have shown that many behaviors engage processes that suppress excitability within the corticospinal tract. Inhibition of the motor output pathway has been extensively studied in the context of action stopping, where a planned movement needs to be abruptly aborted. Recent TMS work has also revealed markers of motor inhibition during the preparation of movement. Here, we review the evidence for motor inhibition during action stopping and action preparation, focusing on studies that have used TMS to monitor changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway.</description>

	<description>Obesity is now a worldwide health issue. Far from being limited to weight gain, obesity is generally associated with low-grade inflammation and with a cluster of disorders collectively known as the ‘metabolic syndrome’. When considering obesity and the subsequent neuroinflammation, the focus was long set on the hypothalamus. More recently, obesity-derived neuroinflammation has been shown to affect other brain structures such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, or amygdala. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with increased occurrence of central disorders such as depression and impaired cognitive function.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Monoamine Transporters as Ionotropic Receptors</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30023-1?rss=yes</link>
	<description>It is well established that glutamate and GABA signal through both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Conversely, it is thought that, with one exception, monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) signal via metabotropic receptors. Given their capacity to generate fast-acting currents, I suggest that the monoamine transporters should be considered as ionotropic receptors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors are preeminent neurotransmitter-gated channels in the CNS, which respond to glutamate in a manner that integrates multiple external and internal cues. They belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family and fulfil unique and crucial roles in neuronal development and function. These roles depend &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern optogenetics can be tuned to evoke activity that corresponds to naturally occurring local or global activity in timing, magnitude or individual-cell patterning. This outcome has been facilitated not only by the development of core features of optogenetics over the past 10 years (microbial-opsin variants, &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Where Does EEG Come From and What Does It Mean?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30024-3?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) has been instrumental in making discoveries about cognition, brain function, and dysfunction. However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Insula: An Underestimated Brain Area in Clinical Neuroscience, Psychiatry, and Neurology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30017-6?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30017-6?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Supported by recent human neuroimaging studies, the insula is re-emerging as an important brain area not only in the physiological understanding of the brain, but also in pathological contexts in clinical research. In this opinion article, we briefly introduce the anatomical and histological features of the human insula. We then summarize the physiological functions of the insula and underscore its pathological roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders that have long been underestimated. We finally propose possible strategies through which the role of the insula may be further understood for both basic and clinical neuroscience.</description>
