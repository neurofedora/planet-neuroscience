	<title>The Cerebellum: Spinocerebellar Ataxia-Like Presentation of the M233V PSEN1 Mutation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Upward Gaze Palsy: a Valuable Sign to Distinguish Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01154-2</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01154-2</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Feasibility and Acceptability of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment in Progressive Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01153-3</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Treatment of Primary Autoimmune Cerebellar Ataxia with Mycophenolate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Acoustic Speech Analytics Are Predictive of Cerebellar Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01151-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Trehalose in Machado-Joseph Disease: Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: EMG Rectification Is Detrimental for Identifying Abnormalities in Corticomuscular and Intermuscular Coherence in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01149-z</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01149-z</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Intermittent Cerebellar Theta Burst Stimulation Improves Visuo-motor Learning in Stroke Patients: a Pilot Study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Are Vermal Lobules VI–VII Smaller in Autism Spectrum Disorder?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01143-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Shh-Mediated Increase in β-Catenin Levels Maintains Cerebellar Granule Neuron Progenitors in Proliferation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents one of the main forms of dementia that afflicts our society. The expression of several genes has been associated with disease development. Despite this, the number of genes known to be capable of discriminating between AD patients according to sex remains deficient. In our study, we performed a transcriptomes meta-analysis on a large court of brains of healthy control subjects (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2139) (NDHC) and brains of AD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1170). Our aim was to verify the brain expression levels of CHI3L2 and its correlation with genes associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (IBA1), alteration of the blood–brain barrier (PECAM1), and neuronal damage (CALB1). We showed that the CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 expression levels were modulated in the brains of patients with AD compared to NDHC subjects. Furthermore, both in NDHC and in AD patient’s brains, the CHI3L2 expression levels were directly correlated with IBA1 and PECAM1 and inversely with CALB1. Additionally, the expression levels of CHI3L2, PECAM1, and CALB1 but not of IBA1 were sex-depended. By stratifying the samples according to age and sex, correlation differences emerged between the expression levels of CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 and the age of NDHC subjects and AD patients. CHI3L2 represents a promising gene potentially involved in the key processes underlying Alzheimer’s disease. Its expression in the brains of sex-conditioned AD patients opens up new possible sex therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling imbalance in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To explore plasma protein panels as potential biomarkers to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among elderly Chinese individuals with different educational backgrounds. Forty-four illiterate, 36 lower education (1–6 years), and 55 higher education (7 years or more) elderly individuals were included in the present study. Among all subjects, 67 were healthy individuals and 68 were diagnosed with MCI. Fifty plasma proteins in blood samples collected from these subjects were analyzed via the Luminex assay. Binary logistic regression was utilized to explore diagnostic models for MCI among the three educational subgroups. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted for the clinical validity of the MCI models. Among the analyzed proteins, clusterin was used in the model of MCI among the total sample with a sensitivity (se) of 67.6%, a specificity (sp) of 59.7%, and a classification rate of 63.68%. The MCI model for the illiterate group included cystatin C, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and apolipoprotein A-I (se: 71.4%, sp.: 82.6%, accuracy: 77.25%). The sensitivity, specificity, and classification rate of the diagnostic model of MCI in elderly adults with lower education (human serum albumin) were each 75.0%. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate of the diagnostic model for MCI elderly individuals with higher education (alpha-acid glycoprotein + soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 + pancreatic polypeptide) were 77.8%, 89.3%, and 83.60%, respectively. The performance of diagnostic models for MCI based on different educational levels is superior to that of diagnostic models for MCI without grouping by educational level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Downregulation of Cancer-Associated lncRNAs in Peripheral Blood of Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have shown contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on the role of these transcripts in the regulation of immune response, peripheral levels of lncRNAs can reflect the level of immune activation. In the present study, we quantified expression of four lncRNAs namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPRY4-IT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt; in venous blood of MS patients and controls using quantitative real-time PCR method. Relative expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPRY4-IT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt; were significantly lower in female MS patients compared with female healthy subjects. For &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt;, this pattern of expression was also observed in male subjects. However, for other lncRNAs, no significant difference was detected between male patients and male controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt; was correlated with progression index (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.36, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Besides, there was a significant correlation between expression of this lncRNA and expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt; in MS patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.44, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). There was no other correlation between expression of lncRNAs and clinical data in MS patients. In control group, expressions of none of lncRNAs were correlated with age of persons. Notably, significant correlations were demonstrated between expression levels of all lncRNAs in healthy subjects with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; values ranging from 0.23 to 0.42. The current investigation shows dysregulation of lncRNAs in MS patients in a sex-specific manner and warrants further studies to unravel the clinical and therapeutic implications of such dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Combination Therapy with Nanomicellar-Curcumin and Temozolomide for In Vitro Therapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme via Wnt Signaling Pathways</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most serious brain tumor and shows a high rate of drug resistance. Wnt signaling is a very important pathway in GBM that can activate/inhibit other pathways, such as apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a combination of temozolomide (TMZ) plus curcumin or nanomicellar-curcumin on the inhibition of GBM growth in vitro, via effects on autophagy, apoptosis, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Two concentrations of curcumin and nanomicellar-curcumin (i.e., 20 μM and 50 μM) alone, and in combination with TMZ (50 μM) were used to induce cytotoxicity in the U87 GBM cell line. Wnt signaling–, autophagy-, and apoptosis-related genes were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blots. All treatments (except 20 μM curcumin alone) significantly decreased the viability of U87 cells compared to controls. Curcumin (50 μM), nanomicellar-curcumin alone and in combination with TMZ significantly decreased the invasion and migration of U87 cells. Autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, LC3-I, LC3-II) were significantly increased. Apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and caspase 8) were also significantly increased, while Bax protein was significantly decreased. The expression levels of Wnt pathway–associated genes (β-catenin, cyclin D1, Twist, and ZEB1) were significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Serine Incorporator 2 (SERINC2) Expression Predicts an Unfavorable Prognosis of Low-Grade Glioma (LGG): Evidence from Bioinformatics Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serine Incorporator 2 (SERINC2) is a transmembrane protein that incorporates serine into membrane lipids. The function of SERINC2 in tumors has been reported, but the role of SERINC2 in gliomas is not fully understood. RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (530 cases of low-grade glioma (LGG) and 173 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) and microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Accession No. GSE16011, 284 cases gliomas were included) were acquired. Bioinformatics analysis was performed as the primary method to examine the function of SERINC2 and its correlated genes in glioma. SERINC2 was highly expressed in GBM compared with LGG and normal brain tissues. Elevated SERINC2 expression predicted shorter 5-, 10-, and 15-year overall survival (OS) of LGG patients and isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) mutation-type LGG patients but had no effect on the OS of GBM patients. Cox regression analysis showed that SERINC2 was an independent factor in LGG OS. Methylation analysis found that 13 CpG methylation sites (methylation450k) correlated with SERINC2 expression in LGG. The mRNA expression level of SERINC2 was significant lower in the DNA deletion group than in the intact and amplification groups. A total of 390 copositive and 244 conegative correlation genes with SERINC2 were obtained from LGG in TCGA-LGG and GSE16011. Gene ontology (GO) category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the copositive correlation genes were primarily enriched in the mitotic process and cell cycle. Combining the results from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SERINC2 correlation genes and CytoHubba led to the selection of 10 hub genes (CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE). OncoLnc analysis confirmed that high expression levels of these hub genes were associated with poor OS in LGG. Our results suggested that aberrant SERINC2 expression existed in glioma and that its expression might be a potential prognostic marker in LGG patients. CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LGG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: MicroRNA-330 Directs Downregulation of the GABA B R2 in the Pathogenesis of Pancreatic Cancer Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and deadly malignancies with a very poor prognosis. Pancreatic cancer-induced visceral pain is very common and is generally presented among the initial symptoms in patients; such pain is strongly associated with poor quality of life, impaired functional activity, and decreased survival. However, the principal neurobiological mechanisms of pain caused by pancreatic cancer have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating studies have shown that miRNAs play a major role in chronic pain by suppressing key molecules involved in nociception. In the present study, we report that microRNA (miR)-330 is highly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain. Mimicking pancreatic carcinoma-induced SDH miR-330 upregulation by microinjection of miR-330 mimic into the SDH significantly induced abdominal mechanical allodynia in normal nude mice. Additionally, we found that the expression of GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 was significantly decreased in the SDH of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain and was regulated directly by miR-330 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-330 rescued the expression of GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 and alleviated pancreatic carcinoma-induced abdominal pain hypersensitivity in nude mice with pancreatic carcinoma. These results show that miR-330 participates in the genesis of pancreatic carcinoma-induced pain hypersensitivity by inhibiting GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 expression in the SDH and might be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent representation of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the degenerative disturbance of the central nervous system. Previous studies have indicated that miR-107 is reduced in the brain neocortex of patients with AD; however, its underlying mechanism is not clear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the question of whether miR-107 participates in AD development. The study confirmed that the miR-107 expression levels were dramatically decreased in patients with AD and in beta-amyloid (Aβ) (Aβ)-treated SH-SY5Y cells compared with control groups. Upregulation of miR-107 reversed the inhibitory role of Aβ on cell proliferation and viability. In addition, miR-107 upregulation also ameliorated the Aβ-induced inflammation and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, using bioinformatic prediction, dual-luciferase reporter assay (DLRA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot (WB), miR-107 was confirmed to reduce the expression level of FGF7, and it subsequently deactivated the FGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, FGF7 overexpression counteracted the role of miR-107 in the viability, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis of Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common type of dementia that accounts for 15 to 30%. To date, VCI still lacks an effective therapeutic strategy and an objective diagnostic tool. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the post-translational level, playing an essential role in the pathogenesis of VCI. Moreover, accumulating evidence has indicated that miRNAs could be used as therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers of diseases. In this review, we summarize various mechanisms of miRNA-based therapeutics and candidate miRNAs for clinical diagnosis in VCI. Results showed that miRNAs participate in VCI via different mechanisms, including neuronal death, inflammation, oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier permeability, and synaptic translation. Circulating miRNAs of VCI have been detected in serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid with various diagnostic power. Taking together, miRNAs are a potential biomarker for being a therapeutic agent and a diagnostic tool of VCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mutations in the dystrophin gene could cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is the most common muscular disorder in pediatrics. Considering the growing evidence on appropriateness of gene therapies for DMD, precise genetic diagnosis seems essential. Hence, we conducted a study to determine mutational patterns in Iranian children with DMD. To detect all probable large mutations in the dystrophin gene, 314 DMD patients were evaluated using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Subjects who were MLPA-negative underwent the next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify potential point mutations. MLPA detected deletions (79.93%) and duplications (5.41%) along the dystrophin gene of 268 patients. Distribution of large mutations was heterogeneous and followed hotspot pattern throughout the gene. From 46 patients who were MLPA-negative, 43 exhibited point mutations including nonsense in 7.64%, frameshifts in 4.77%, splicing in 0.96%, and missense variations in 0.32% of participants. Most of the point mutations were located between exons 19 and 40. In three patients (1%), no mutation was found using either MLPA or NGS. Two subjects had novel nonsense mutations (L1675X and E1199X) in their dystrophin gene, which were considered as the possible reason for elimination of major domains of the gene. The results of this study provided invaluable information regarding the distribution of various large and small mutations in Iranian individuals with DMD. Besides, the novel nonsense mutations L1675X and E1199X were identified within the highly conserved residues, leading to elimination of significant domains of the dystrophin gene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in humans and the most deadly. Stem cells, which are characterized by therapeutic resistance and self-renewal, play a critical role in glioma, and therefore the identification of stem cell-related genes in glioma is important. In this study, we collected and evaluated the epigenetically regulated-mRNA expression-based stemness index (EREG-mRNAsi) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, &lt;a class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) for glioma patient samples, corrected through tumor purity. After EREG-mRNAsi correction, glioma pathological grade and survival were analyzed. The differentially expressed gene (DEG) co-expression network was constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in TCGA glioma samples to find modules of interest and key genes. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway-enrichment analysis were performed to identify the function of significant genetic modules. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) and co-expression network analysis of key genes was performed for further analysis. In this experiment, we found that corrected EREG-mRNAsi was significantly up-regulated in glioma samples and increased with glioma grade, with G4 having the highest stemness index. Patients with higher corrected EREG-mRNAsi scores had worse overall survival. Fifty-one DEGs in the brown gene module were found to be positively related to EREG-mRNAsi via WGCNA. GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that chromosome segregation and cell cycle molecular function were the major functions in key DEGs. Among these key DEGs, BUB1 showed high connectivity and co-expression, and also high connectivity in PPI. Fifty-one key genes were verified to play a critical role in glioma stem cells. These genes may serve as primary therapeutic targets to inhibit the activity of glioma stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Environmental deformations dynamically shift human spatial memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23265?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23265?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place and grid cells in the hippocampal formation are commonly thought to support a unified and coherent cognitive map of space. This mapping mechanism faces a challenge when a navigator is placed in a familiar environment that has been deformed from its original shape. Under such circumstances, many transformations could plausibly serve to map a navigator's familiar cognitive map to the deformed space. Previous empirical results indicate that the firing fields of rodent place and grid cells stretch or compress in a manner that approximately matches the environmental deformation, and human spatial memory exhibits similar distortions. These effects have been interpreted as evidence that reshaping a familiar environment elicits an analogously reshaped cognitive map. However, recent work has suggested an alternative explanation, whereby deformation‐induced distortions of the grid code are attributable to a mechanism that dynamically anchors grid fields to the most recently experienced boundary, thus causing history‐dependent shifts in grid phase. This interpretation raises the possibility that human spatial memory will exhibit similar history‐dependent dynamics. To test this prediction, we taught participants the locations of objects in a virtual environment and then probed their memory for these locations in deformed versions of this environment. Across three experiments with variable access to visual and vestibular cues, we observed the predicted pattern, whereby the remembered locations of objects were shifted from trial to trial depending on the boundary of origin of the participant's movement trajectory. These results provide evidence for a dynamic anchoring mechanism that governs both neuronal firing and spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Revisiting the idea that amyloid-β peptide acts as an agonist for P2X7</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00166</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00166</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The P2X7 receptor is a cell surface ligand-gated ion channel, activated by its physiological nucleotide agonist ATP and a synthetic analogue (BzATP). However, it has also been suggested that there may be structurally unrelated, non-nucleotide agonists such as the amyloidogenic β peptide. Here we aimed to reassess the effect of amyloid β peptides in various in vitro cell models, namely HEK293 overexpressing human P2X7, the microglial BV-2 cell line, and BV-2 cells lacking P2X7. We measured YO-PRO-1 dye uptake in response to full-length amyloid β peptide (1-42) or the shorter amyloid β peptide (25-35) and there was a concentration-dependent increase in YOPRO-1 dye uptake in HEK-hP2X7 cells. However, these amyloid β peptide-induced increases in YOPRO-1 dye uptake were also identical in non-transfected HEK-293 cells. We could observe small transient increases in [Ca2+]i induced by amyloid β peptides in BV-2 cells, however these were identical in BV-2 cells lacking P2X7. Furthermore, our metabolic viability and LDH release experiments suggest no significant change in viability or cell membrane damage in HEK-hP2X7 cells. In the BV-2 cells we found that high concentrations of amyloid β peptides (1-42) and (25-35) could reduce cell viability by up to 35% but this was also seen in BV-2 cells lacking P2X7. We found no evidence of LDH release by amyloid β peptides. In summary, we found no evidence that amyloid β peptides act as agonists of P2X7 in our in vitro models. Our study raises the possibility that amyloid β peptides simply mimic features of P2X7 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Developmental Distribution of Primary Cilia in the Retinofugal Visual Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25029?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25029?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Developmental Distribution of Primary Cilia in the Retinofugal Visual Pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c810d72c-285f-43b3-b402-8c77e7d10310/cne25029-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we show that both the number of primary cilia and the number of ciliated neurons declines with age in major retinorecipient targets. Our data suggests that the maturation timing of neuronal and non‐neural cilia differs with maturation of neuronal cilia occurring over a longer postnatal period.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system is composed of circuitry connecting sensory input from the retina to the processing core of the visual cortex. The two main retinorecipient brain targets, the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), bridge retinal input and visual output. The primary cilium is a conserved organelle increasingly viewed as a critical sensor for the regulation of developmental and homeostatic pathways in most mammalian cell types. Moreover, cilia have been described as crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and survival in the cortex and retina. However, cilia in the visual relay center remain to be fully described. In this study, we characterized the ciliation profile of the SC and dLGN and found that the overall number of ciliated cells declined during development. Interestingly, shorter ciliated cells in both regions were identified as neurons, whose numbers remained stable over time, suggesting that cilia retention is a critical feature for optimal neuronal function in SC and dLGN. Our study suggests that primary cilia are important for neuronal maturation and function in cells of the SC and dLGN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience has shown great progress in recent years. Several of the
theoretical bases have arisen from the examination of dynamic systems, using
Neural Mass Models (NMMs). Due to the largescale brain dynamics of NMMs and the
difficulty of studying nonlinear systems, the local linearization approach to
discretize the state equation was used via an algebraic formulation, as it
intervenes favorably in the speed and efficiency of numerical integration. To
study the spacetime organization of the brain and generate more complex
dynamics, three structural levels (cortical unit, population and system) were
defined and assumed, in which the new assumed representation for conduction
delays and new ways of connecting were defined. This is a new time-delay NMM,
which can simulate several types of EEG activities since kinetics information
was considered at three levels of complexity. Results obtained in this analysis
provide additional theoretical foundations and indicate specific
characteristics for understanding neurodynamic.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An Extensive Experimental Evaluation of Automated Machine Learning Methods for Recommending Classification Algorithms (Extended Version). (arXiv:2009.07430v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07430</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07430</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents an experimental comparison among four Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) methods for recommending the best classification algorithm
for a given input dataset. Three of these methods are based on Evolutionary
Algorithms (EAs), and the other is Auto-WEKA, a well-known AutoML method based
on the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter optimisation (CASH)
approach. The EA-based methods build classification algorithms from a single
machine learning paradigm: either decision-tree induction, rule induction, or
Bayesian network classification. Auto-WEKA combines algorithm selection and
hyper-parameter optimisation to recommend classification algorithms from
multiple paradigms. We performed controlled experiments where these four AutoML
methods were given the same runtime limit for different values of this limit.
In general, the difference in predictive accuracy of the three best AutoML
methods was not statistically significant. However, the EA evolving
decision-tree induction algorithms has the advantage of producing algorithms
that generate interpretable classification models and that are more scalable to
large datasets, by comparison with many algorithms from other learning
paradigms that can be recommended by Auto-WEKA. We also observed that Auto-WEKA
has shown meta-overfitting, a form of overfitting at the meta-learning level,
rather than at the base-learning level.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that brain network dynamics is a key determinant of brain
function and dysfunction. Here we propose a new framework to assess the
dynamics of brain networks based on recurrence analysis. Our framework uses
recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis to characterize dynamic
networks. For resting-state magnetoencephalographic dynamic functional networks
(dFNs), we have found that functional networks recur more quickly in people
with epilepsy than healthy controls. This suggests that recurrence of dFNs may
be used as a biomarker of epilepsy. For stereo electroencephalography data, we
have found that dFNs involved in epileptic seizures emerge before seizure
onset, and recurrence analysis allows us to detect seizures. We further observe
distinct dFNs before and after seizures, which may inform neurostimulation
strategies to prevent seizures. Our framework can also be used for
understanding dFNs in healthy brain function and in other neurological
disorders besides epilepsy.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Early Disruption of Cortical Sleep-Related Oscillations in a Mouse Model of Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB) Expressing Human Mutant (A30P) Alpha-Synuclein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579867</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579867</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes in sleep behavior and sleep-related cortical activity have been reported in conditions associated with abnormal alpha-synuclein (α-syn) expression, in particular Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Notably, changes can occur in patients years before the onset of cognitive decline. Sleep-related network oscillations play a key role in memory function, but how abnormal α-syn impacts the generation of such activity is currently unclear. To determine whether early changes in sleep-related network activity could also be observed, prior to any previously reported cognitive dysfunction, we used mice that over-express human mutant α-syn (A30P). Recordings in vivo were performed under urethane anesthesia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and CA1 region of the hippocampus in young male (2.5 – 4 months old) A30P and age-matched wild type (WT) mice. We found that the slow oscillation (SO) &amp;lt; 1 Hz frequency was significantly faster in both the mPFC and hippocampus in A30P mice, and Up-state-associated fast oscillations at beta (20 – 30 Hz) and gamma (30 – 80 Hz) frequencies were delayed relative to the onset of the Up-state. Spindle (8 – 15 Hz) activity in the mPFC was also altered in A30P mice, as spindles were shorter in duration and had reduced density compared to WT. These changes demonstrate that dysregulation of sleep-related oscillations occurs in young A30P mice long before the onset of cognitive dysfunction. Our data suggest that, as seen in patients, changes in sleep-related oscillations are an early consequence of abnormal α-syn aggregation in A30P mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mapping the Interactive Effects of ApoE Gene Polymorphism on Caudate Functional Connectivity in Mild Cognitive Impairment Associated With Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment (CI) is a frequent non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Caudate and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) are biomarkers linked to CI in PD. There is little known about whether ApoE affects caudate in mild CI of PD (PD-MCI). We investigated the possible interactive effect of ApoE genotypes on caudate functional connectivity (FC) in PD-MCI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 95 PD-MCI patients and 99 matched healthy controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. The two groups were separated into three subgroups according to their genotyping. Functional data were analyzed with FC analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Decreased FC between the caudate and the bilateral inferior orbit frontal gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus (MOG) was found between groups, along with poor performance in general, executive, episodic memory, language, and visual–spatial function. Decreased FC between the caudate and right MOG, right middle temporal gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus was found as an interaction effect. The FC values of ε4 carriers with PD-MCI were much lower than the other carriers, and FC was positively correlated with the impairment of global and language function.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results support the idea that altered FC between the bilateral caudate and posterior cortical regions was interactively influenced by ApoE genotype and PD-MCI status, and the ε4 subtype associated with underlying pathology of global cognitive decline and semantic fluency impairment in an interactive manner. Gene-based imaging approaches might strengthen the credibility in imaging genetic associations, which might provide new powerful insights into the neural mechanisms underlying PD-MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Identification and Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Patients Using Novel Fractional Motion Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques use the mono-exponential model to describe the diffusion process of water in the brain. However, the observed dMRI signal decay curve deviates from the mono-exponential form. To solve this problem, the fractional motion (FM) model has been developed, which is regarded as a more appropriate model for describing the complex diffusion process in brain tissue. It is still unclear in the identification and classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients using the FM model. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential feasibility of FM model for differentiating AD patients from healthy controls and grading patients with AD. Twenty-four patients with AD and 11 healthy controls were included. The left and right hippocampus were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and FM-related parameters, including the Noah exponent (α), the Hurst exponent (H), and the memory parameter (μ=H−1/α), were calculated and compared between AD patients and healthy controls and between mild AD and moderate AD patients using a two-sample t-test. The correlations between FM-related parameters α, H, μ, and ADC values and the cognitive functions assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scales were investigated using Pearson partial correlation analysis in patients with AD. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the differential performance. We found that the FM-related parameter α could be used to distinguish AD patients from healthy controls (P &amp;lt; 0.05) with greater sensitivity and specificity (left ROI, 0.917 and 0.636; right ROI, 0.917 and 0.727) and grade AD patients (P &amp;lt; 0.05) showed higher sensitivity and specificity (right ROI, 0.917, 0.75). The α was found to be positively correlated with MMSE (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and MoCA (P &amp;lt; 0.05) scores in patients with AD, indicating that the α values in the bilateral hippocampus were a potential MRI-based biomarker of disease severity in AD patients. This novel diffusion model may be useful for further understanding neuropathologic changes in patients with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Machine-Based Prediction Model of ADHD Using CPT Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560021</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560021</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of the continuous performance test (CPT) in the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its specificity, sensitivity, and ecological validity are still debated. To address some of the known shortcomings of traditional analysis and interpretation of CPT data, the present study applied a machine learning-based model (ML) using CPT indices for the Prediction of ADHD.Using a retrospective factorial fitting, followed by a bootstrap technique, we trained, cross-validated, and tested learning models on CPT performance data of 458 children aged 6–12 years (213 children with ADHD and 245 typically developed children). We used the MOXO-CPT version that included visual and auditory stimuli distractors. Results showed that the ML proposed model performed better and had a higher accuracy than the benchmark approach that used clinical data only. Using the CPT total score (that included all four indices: Attention, Timeliness, Hyperactivity, and Impulsiveness), as well as four control variables [age, gender, day of the week (DoW), time of day (ToD)], provided the most salient information for discriminating children with ADHD from their typically developed peers. This model had an accuracy rate of 87%, a sensitivity rate of 89%, and a specificity rate of 84%. This performance was 34% higher than the best-achieved accuracy of the benchmark model. The ML detection model could classify children with ADHD with high accuracy based on CPT performance. ML model of ADHD holds the promise of enhancing, perhaps complementing, behavioral assessment and may be used as a supportive measure in the evaluation of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Abnormal Spatial Patterns of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head: A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common condition that is encountered in clinical practice, and yet, little is known about its characteristics and manifestations in the brain. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the spatial patterns of spontaneous brain activity in the brain of ONFH patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The study included ONFH patients and healthy controls. The pattern of intrinsic brain activity was measured by examining the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals using rs-fMRI. Meanwhile, we also used Harris hip scores to evaluate the functional performance of ONFH patients and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Ten ONFH patients and 10 health controls were investigated. We found global ALFF differences between the two groups throughout the occipital, parietal, frontal, prefrontal, and temporal cortices. In the ONFH patients, altered brain activity was found in the brain regions in the sensorimotor network, pain-related network, and emotion and cognition network. The results of the correlation investigations also demonstrated that the regions with ALFF changes had significant correlations with the functional performance of the patients evaluated by Harris hip scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study has revealed the abnormal pattern of brain activity in ONFH patients, and our findings could be used to aid in understanding the mechanisms behind the gait abnormality and intractable pain associated with ONFH at the central level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: K+ Channels in Primary Afferents and Their Role in Nerve Injury-Induced Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.566418</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory abnormalities generated by nerve injury, peripheral neuropathy or disease are often expressed as neuropathic pain. This type of pain is frequently resistant to therapeutic intervention and may be intractable. Numerous studies have revealed the importance of enduring increases in primary afferent excitability and persistent spontaneous activity in the onset and maintenance of peripherally induced neuropathic pain. Some of this activity results from modulation, increased activity and /or expression of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) include delayed rectifiers (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1, 1.2), A-channels (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3), KCNQ or M-channels (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5), ATP-sensitive channels (K&lt;sub&gt;IR&lt;/sub&gt;6.2), Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1), Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;4.1 and 4.2) and two pore domain leak channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2p&lt;/sub&gt;; TWIK related channels). Function of all K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel types is reduced via a multiplicity of processes leading to altered expression and/or post-translational modification. This also increases excitability of DRG cell bodies and nociceptive free nerve endings, alters axonal conduction and increases neurotransmitter release from primary afferent terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Correlation of these cellular changes with behavioral studies provides almost indisputable evidence for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction in the onset and maintenance of neuropathic pain. This idea is underlined by the observation that selective impairment of just one subtype of DRG K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel can produce signs of pain in vivo. Whilst it is established that various mediators, including cytokines and growth factors bring about injury-induced changes in DRG function and excitability, evidence presently available points to a seminal role for interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in control of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel function. Despite the current state of knowledge, attempts to target K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels for therapeutic pain management have met with limited success. This situation may change with the advent of personalized medicine. Identification of specific sensory abnormalities and genetic profiling of individual patients may predict therapeutic benefit of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel activators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Integration of Within-Cell Experimental Data With Multi-Compartmental Modeling Predicts H-Channel Densities and Distributions in Hippocampal OLM Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00277</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining biophysical details of spatially extended neurons is a challenge that needs to be overcome if we are to understand the dynamics of brain function from cellular perspectives. Moreover, we now know that we should not average across recordings from many cells of a given cell type to obtain quantitative measures such as conductance since measures can vary multiple-fold for a given cell type. In this work we examine whether a tight combination of experimental and computational work can address this challenge. The oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) interneuron operates as a “gate” that controls incoming sensory and ongoing contextual information in the CA1 of the hippocampus, making it essential to understand how its biophysical properties contribute to memory function. OLM cells fire phase-locked to the prominent hippocampal theta rhythms, and we previously used computational models to show that OLM cells exhibit high or low theta spiking resonance frequencies that depend respectively on whether their dendrites have hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (h-channels) or not. However, whether OLM cells actually possess dendritic h-channels is unknown at present. We performed a set of whole-cell recordings of OLM cells from mouse hippocampus and constructed three multi-compartment models using morphological and electrophysiological parameters extracted from the same OLM cell, including per-cell pharmacologically isolated h-channel currents. We found that the models best matched experiments when h-channels were present in the dendrites of each of the three model cells created. This strongly suggests that h-channels must be present in OLM cell dendrites and are not localized to their somata. Importantly, this work shows that a tight integration of model and experiment can help tackle the challenge of characterizing biophysical details and distributions in spatially extended neurons. Full spiking models were built for two of the OLM cells, matching their current clamp cell-specific electrophysiological recordings. Overall, our work presents a technical advancement in modeling OLM cells. Our models are available to the community to use to gain insight into cellular dynamics underlying hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Synapses are fundamental information processing units that rely on voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) channels to trigger Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent neurotransmitter release. Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels also play Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent roles in other biological contexts, but whether they do so in axon terminals is unknown. Here, we addressed this unknown with respect to the requirement for Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 L-type channels for the formation of rod photoreceptor synapses in the retina. Using a mouse strain expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, we report that the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 protein, but not its Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, is required for the molecular assembly of rod synapses; however, Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.4 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals are needed for the appropriate recruitment of postsynaptic partners. Our results support a model in which presynaptic Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels serve both as organizers of synaptic building blocks and as sources of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in building the first synapse of the visual pathway and perhaps more broadly in the nervous system.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alkylative damage of mRNA leads to ribosome stalling and rescue by trans translation in bacteria</title>

	<description>Similar to DNA replication, translation of the genetic code by the ribosome is hypothesized to be exceptionally sensitive to small chemical changes to its template mRNA. Here we show that addition of common alkylating agents to growing cultures of &lt;i&gt;E. coli &lt;/i&gt;leads to accumulation of several adducts within RNA, including N(1)-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A). As expected, the introduction of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A to model mRNAs was found to reduce the rate of peptide-bond formation by three orders of magnitude in a well-defined &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; system. These observations suggest that alkylative stress is likely to stall translation &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;and necessitates activation of ribosome-rescue pathways. Indeed, the addition of alkylation agents was found to robustly activate the transfer-messenger RNA system, even when transcription was inhibited. Our findings suggest that bacteria carefully monitor the chemical integrity of their mRNA and they evolved rescue pathways to cope with its effect on translation.</description>

	<description>JCPyV polyomavirus, a member of the human virome, causes Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), an oft-fatal demyelinating brain disease in individuals receiving immunomodulatory therapies. Mutations in the major viral capsid protein, VP1, are common in JCPyV from PML patients (JCPyV-PML) but whether they confer neurovirulence or escape from virus-neutralizing antibody (nAb) &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is unknown. A mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) with a sequence-equivalent JCPyV-PML VP1 mutation replicated poorly in the kidney, a major reservoir for JCPyV persistence, but retained the CNS infectivity, cell tropism, and neuropathology of the parental virus. This mutation rendered MuPyV resistant to a monoclonal Ab (mAb), whose specificity overlapped the endogenous anti-VP1 response. Using cryo EM and a custom sub-particle refinement approach, we resolved an MuPyV:Fab complex map to 3.2 Å resolution. The structure revealed the mechanism of mAb evasion. Our findings demonstrate convergence between nAb evasion and CNS neurovirulence &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by a frequent JCPyV-PML VP1 mutation.</description>

	<title>eLife: MAPK activity dynamics regulate non-cell autonomous effects of oncogene expression</title>

	<description>A large fraction of human cancers contain genetic alterations within the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling network that promote unpredictable phenotypes. Previous studies have shown that the temporal patterns of MAPK activity (i.e. signaling dynamics) differentially regulate cell behavior. However, the role of signaling dynamics in mediating the effects of cancer driving mutations has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that oncogene expression leads to either pulsatile or sustained ERK activity that correlate with opposing cellular behaviors (i.e. proliferation vs. cell cycle arrest, respectively). Moreover, sustained–but not pulsatile–ERK activity triggers ERK activity waves in unperturbed neighboring cells that depend on the membrane metalloprotease ADAM17 and EGFR activity. Interestingly, the ADAM17-EGFR signaling axis coordinates neighboring cell migration toward oncogenic cells and is required for oncogenic cell extrusion. Overall, our data suggests that the temporal patterns of MAPK activity differentially regulate cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of oncogene expression.</description>

	<title>eLife: Quantitative mapping of transcriptome and proteome dynamics during polarization of human iPSC-derived neurons</title>

	<description>The differentiation of neuronal stem cells into polarized neurons is a well-coordinated process which has mostly been studied in classical non-human model systems, but to what extent these findings are recapitulated in human neurons remains unclear. To study neuronal polarization in human neurons, we cultured hiPSC-derived neurons, characterized early developmental stages, measured electrophysiological responses, and systematically profiled transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics during these steps. The neuron transcriptome and proteome shows extensive remodeling, with differential expression profiles of ~1100 transcripts and ~2200 proteins during neuronal differentiation and polarization. We also identified a distinct axon developmental stage marked by the relocation of axon initial segment proteins and increased microtubule remodeling from the distal (stage 3a) to the proximal (stage 3b) axon. This developmental transition coincides with action potential maturation. Our comprehensive characterization and quantitative map of transcriptome and proteome dynamics provides a solid framework for studying polarization in human neurons.</description>

	<title>eLife: miRNA profile is altered in a modified EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis featuring cortical lesions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56916</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56916</link>
	<description>Cortical lesions represent a hallmark of multiple sclerosis and are proposed as a predictor of disease severity. microRNAs are suggested to be important players in the disease pathogenesis and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model. We implemented a mouse model recapitulating more closely the human pathology as it is characterized by both an autoimmune heterogeneity and the presence of cortical lesions, two parameters missing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In our model, mice clustered in two groups displaying high or low clinical scores. Upon cortical cytokine injection, lesions appeared with a specific topography while cortical miRNA profiles were altered. These two features differed according to disease severity. We evidenced changes in miRNA regulators and targets suggesting that miRNA alteration had functional repercussions that could explain the differences in cortical lesions. This model represents a crucial tool for the study of both miRNA involvement and cortical lesion formation in disease pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Training deep neural density estimators to identify mechanistic models of neural dynamics</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56261</link>
	<description>Mechanistic modeling in neuroscience aims to explain observed phenomena in terms of underlying causes. However, determining which model parameters agree with complex and stochastic neural data presents a significant challenge. We address this challenge with a machine learning tool which uses deep neural density estimators- trained using model simulations- to carry out Bayesian inference and retrieve the full space of parameters compatible with raw data or selected data features. Our method is scalable in parameters and data features, and can rapidly analyze new data after initial training. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach on receptive fields, ion channels, and Hodgkin-Huxley models. We also characterize the space of circuit configurations giving rise to rhythmic activity in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, and use these results to derive hypotheses for underlying compensation mechanisms. Our approach will help close the gap between data-driven and theory-driven models of neural dynamics.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55585</link>
	<description>The insular cortex (IC) plays key roles in emotional and regulatory brain functions and is affected across psychiatric diseases. However, the brain-wide connections of the mouse IC have not been comprehensively mapped. Here we traced the whole-brain inputs and outputs of the mouse IC across its rostro-caudal extent. We employed cell-type specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracings to characterize afferent connections onto either excitatory or inhibitory IC neurons, and adeno-associated viral tracings to label excitatory efferent axons. While the connectivity between the IC and other cortical regions was highly bidirectional, the IC connectivity with subcortical structures was often unidirectional, revealing prominent cortical-to-subcortical or subcortical-to-cortical pathways. The posterior and medial IC exhibited resembling connectivity patterns, while the anterior IC connectivity was distinct, suggesting two major functional compartments. Our results provide insights into the anatomical architecture of the mouse IC and thus a structural basis to guide investigations into its complex functions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Topological constraints in early multicellularity favor reproductive division of labor</title>

	<description>Reproductive division of labor (e.g., germ-soma specialization) is a hallmark of the evolution of multicellularity, signifying the emergence of a new type of individual and facilitating the evolution of increased organismal complexity. A large body of work from evolutionary biology, economics, and ecology has shown that specialization is beneficial when further division of labor produces an accelerating increase in absolute productivity (i.e., productivity is a convex function of specialization). Here we show that reproductive specialization is qualitatively different from classical models of resource sharing, and can evolve even when the benefits of specialization are saturating (i.e., productivity is a concave function of specialization). Through analytical theory and evolutionary individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that reproductive specialization is strongly favored in sparse networks of cellular interactions that reflect the morphology of early, simple multicellular organisms, highlighting the importance of restricted social interactions in the evolution of reproductive specialization.</description>

	<description>Recent work has implicated the primate basal ganglia in visual perception and attention, in addition to their traditional role in motor control. The basal ganglia, especially the caudate nucleus 'head' (CDh) of the striatum, receive indirect anatomical connections from the superior colliculus, a midbrain structure that is known to play a crucial role in the control of visual attention. To test the possible functional relationship between these subcortical structures, we recorded CDh neuronal activity of macaque monkeys before and during unilateral superior colliculus (SC) inactivation in a spatial attention task. SC inactivation significantly altered the attention-related modulation of CDh neurons and strongly impaired the classification of task epochs based on CDh activity. Only inactivation of SC on the same side of the brain as recorded CDh neurons, not the opposite side, had these effects. These results demonstrate a novel interaction between SC activity and attention-related visual processing in the basal ganglia.</description>

	<description>The thalamus is a key brain structure engaged in attentional functions, such as selectively amplifying task-relevant signals of one sensory modality while filtering distractors of another. To investigate computational mechanisms of attentional modulation, we developed a biophysically grounded thalamic reticular circuit model, comprising excitatory thalamocortical and inhibitory reticular neurons, which captures characteristic neurophysiological observations from the alert behaving animals. Top-down attentional control inputs onto reticular neurons effectively modulate thalamic gain and enhance downstream readout, to improve performance across detection, discrimination, and cross-modal task paradigms. Heterogeneity of thalamic responses plays an essential role in downstream decoding during attentional modulation. Dynamical systems analysis explains why reticular neurons are an especially potent site for top-down control, as implicated by experiments. Perturbation analysis reveals excitation-inhibition ratio as an effective parameter governing thalamic processing. These findings establish experimentally testable circuit mechanisms for attentional control in thalamus, with implications for distributed neural control of cognitive processing.</description>

	<description>Multiple circadian clocks dynamically regulate mammalian physiology. In retina, rhythmic gene expression serves to align vision and tissue homeostasis with daily light changes. Photic input is relayed to the suprachiasmatic nucleus to entrain the master clock, which matches behaviour to environmental changes. Circadian organization of the mouse retina involves coordinated, layer-specific oscillators, but so far little is known about the cone photoreceptor clock and its role in the circadian system. Using the cone-only Nrl-/- mouse model we show that cones contain a functional self-sustained molecular clockwork. By bioluminescence-combined imaging we also show that cones provide substantial input to the retinal clock network. Furthermore, we found that light entrainment and negative masking in cone-only mice are subtly altered and that constant light displayed profound effects on their central clock. Thus, our study demonstrates the contribution of cones to retinal circadian organisation and their role in finely tuning behaviour to environmental conditions.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: DeepHE: Accurately predicting human essential genes based on deep learning</title>

Accurately predicting essential genes using computational methods can greatly reduce the effort in finding them via wet experiments at both time and resource scales, and further accelerate the process of drug discovery. Several computational methods have been proposed for predicting essential genes in model organisms by integrating multiple biological data sources either via centrality measures or machine learning based methods. However, the methods aiming to predict human essential genes are still limited and the performance still need improve. In addition, most of the machine learning based essential gene prediction methods are lack of skills to handle the imbalanced learning issue inherent in the essential gene prediction problem, which might be one factor affecting their performance. We propose a deep learning based method, DeepHE, to predict human essential genes by integrating features derived from sequence data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A deep learning based network embedding method is utilized to automatically learn features from PPI network. In addition, 89 sequence features were derived from DNA sequence and protein sequence for each gene. These two types of features are integrated to train a multilayer neural network. A cost-sensitive technique is used to address the imbalanced learning problem when training the deep neural network. The experimental results for predicting human essential genes show that our proposed method, DeepHE, can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average performance of AUC higher than 94%, the area under precision-recall curve (AP) higher than 90%, and the accuracy higher than 90%. We also compare DeepHE with several widely used traditional machine learning models (SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Adaboost) using the same features and utilizing the same cost-sensitive technique to against the imbalanced learning issue. The experimental results show that DeepHE significantly outperforms the compared machine learning models. We have demonstrated that human essential genes can be accurately predicted by designing effective machine learning algorithm and integrating representative features captured from available biological data. The proposed deep learning framework is effective for such task.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cdGfRU0auNQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

CRISPR screens are a powerful technology for the identification of genome sequences that affect cellular phenotypes such as gene expression, survival, and proliferation. By targeting non-coding sequences for perturbation, CRISPR screens have the potential to systematically discover novel functional sequences, however, a lack of purpose-built analysis tools limits the effectiveness of this approach. Here we describe RELICS, a Bayesian hierarchical model for the discovery of functional sequences from CRISPR screens. RELICS specifically addresses many of the challenges of non-coding CRISPR screens such as the unknown locations of functional sequences, overdispersion in the observed single guide RNA counts, and the need to combine information across multiple pools in an experiment. RELICS outperforms existing methods with higher precision, higher recall, and finer-resolution predictions on simulated datasets. We apply RELICS to published CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation screens to predict and experimentally validate novel regulatory sequences that are missed by other analysis methods. In summary, RELICS is a powerful new analysis method for CRISPR screens that enables the discovery of functional sequences with unprecedented resolution and accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gx9Jskj0jyA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Diet choice: The two-factor host acceptance system of silkworm larvae</title>

Many herbivorous insects are mono- or oligophagous, having evolved to select a limited range of host plants. They specifically identify host-plant leaves using their keen sense of taste. Plant secondary metabolites and sugars are thought to be key chemical cues that enable insects to identify host plants and evaluate their quality as food. However, the neuronal and behavioral mechanisms of host-plant recognition are poorly understood. Here, we report a two-factor host acceptance system in larvae of the silkworm &lt;i&gt;Bombyx mori&lt;/i&gt;, a specialist on several mulberry species. The first step is controlled by a chemosensory organ, the maxillary palp (MP). During palpation at the leaf edge, the MP detects trace amounts of leaf-surface compounds, which enables host-plant recognition without biting. Chemosensory neurons in the MP are tuned with ultrahigh sensitivity (thresholds of attomolar to femtomolar) to chlorogenic acid (CGA), quercetin glycosides, and β-sitosterol (βsito). Only if these 3 compounds are detected does the larva make a test bite, which is evaluated in the second step. Low-sensitivity neurons in another chemosensory organ, the maxillary galea (MG), mainly detect sucrose in the leaf sap exuded by test biting, allowing larvae to accept the leaf and proceed to persistent biting (feeding). The two-factor host acceptance system reported here may commonly underlie stereotyped feeding behavior in many phytophagous insects and determine their feeding habits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cbLNpcTi0PE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Morphological and physiological properties of Rohon‐Beard neurons along the zebrafish spinal cord&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/149071cf-fbcf-4ae6-bbe2-1504d1488477/cne25033-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory afferents serve as the first level of signal processing at the somatosensory periphery and provide information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Here, we show that the mechanosensory Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons in larval zebrafish are rapidly adapting cells that can signal stimulus onset and offset and encode stimulus intensity implementing rate and temporal coding mechanisms. We also revealed a rostrocaudal variation in both morphology and physiology within the RB neuron population, which offers insights on what signals RBs carry into central circuits and on their role in locomotor behaviors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location, which can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sympathetic innervation of inguinal white adipose tissue in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/216152c7-c93a-4e2b-8b3b-8e1b094f12ce/cne25031-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre‐and postganglionic sympathetic iWAT inputs are anatomically distinct from iBAT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsolumbar and inguinal iWAT portions are innervated by anatomically distinct sympathetic nerves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sympathetic postganglionic iWAT innervation reaches its target organ via lateral cutaneous rami of intercostal nerves T11‐L1 and anterior cutaneous femoral nerve (as part of the lumbar plexus, L1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White adipocytes are sparsely innervated (sparse varicosities), while brown adipocytes (beige islands) show dense innervation (dense varicosities) in iWAT


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and its prominent role as endocrine organ is now well‐recognized. Adipose tissue is controlled via the sympathetic nervous system. New viral, molecular‐genetic tools will soon allow a more detailed study of adipose tissue innervation in metabolic function, yet, the precise anatomical extent of pre‐and postganglionic inputs to the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is limited. Furthermore, several viral, molecular‐genetic tools will require the use of cre/loxP mouse models, while the available studies on sympathetic iWAT innervation were established in larger species. In this study, we generated a detailed map for the sympathetic innervation of iWAT in male and female mice. We adapted iDISCO tissue clearing to process large, whole‐body specimens for an unprecedented view of the natural abdominal sympathetic nervous system. Combined with pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing from the iWAT, we defined the pre‐and postganglionic sympathetic input to iWAT. We used fluorescence‐guided anatomical dissections of sympathetic nerves in reporter mice to further clarify that postganglionic axons connect to iWAT via lateral cutaneous rami (dorsolumbar iWAT portion) and the lumbar plexus (inguinal iWAT portion). Importantly, these rami carry axons that branch to iWAT, as well as axons that travel further to innervate the skin and vasculature, and their functional impact will require consideration in denervation studies. Our study may serve as a comprehensive map for future experiments that employ virally‐driven neuromodulation techniques to predict anatomy‐based viral labeling.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differential development of myelin in zebra finch song nuclei</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differential development of myelin in zebra finch song nuclei&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/47712654-ffbf-410b-a7e1-03257b77f6d5/cne25019-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (&lt;i&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/i&gt;) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Lesion Age Imaging in Acute Stroke: Water Uptake in CT Versus DWI‐FLAIR Mismatch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25903?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25903?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset, MR‐based diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) estimates lesion age to guide intravenous thrombolysis. CT‐based quantitative net water uptake (NWU) may be a potential alternative. The purpose of this study was to directly compare CT‐based NWU to MRI at identifying patients with lesion age &amp;lt;4.5h from symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 acute anterior circulation stroke patients were analyzed with both imaging modalities at admission between 0.5h‐8.0h after known symptom onset. DWI‐FLAIR lesion mismatch was rated and NWU was measured in admission‐CT. An established NWU‐threshold (11.5%) was used to classify patients within and beyond 4.5h. Multiparametric MRI signal was compared to NWU using logistic regression analyses. The empirical distribution of NWU was analyzed in a consecutive cohort of wake‐up stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median time between CT and MRI was 35 minutes (IQR: 24‐50). The accuracy of DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was 68.8% (95%CI: 53.7‐81.3%) with a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 82%. The accuracy of NWU‐threshold was 86.0% (95%CI: 73.3‐94.2%) with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 78%. The AUC of multiparametric MRI to classify lesion age &amp;lt;4.5h was 0.86 (95%CI: 0.64‐0.97), and the AUC of quantitative NWU was 0.91 (95%CI: 0.78‐0.98). Among 87 wake‐up stroke patients, 46 patients (53%) showed low NWU (&amp;lt;11.5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predictive power of CT‐based lesion water imaging to identify patients within the time window of thrombolysis was comparable to multiparametric DWI‐FLAIR MRI. A significant proportion of wake‐up stroke patients with low NWU may be potentially suitable for thrombolysis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Biallelic intronic AAGGG expansion of RFC1 is related to multiple system atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25902?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25902?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, in the &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late‐onset ataxia. For cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the recessive biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype was present in approximately 92% of cases. This study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to multiple system atrophy (MSA) which shared a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; repeat and five other PNRs in Chinese 104 sporadic adult‐onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) patients, 282 MSA patients and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular genetic tests were used, including long‐range PCR, RP‐PCR, Sanger sequencing and Southern blot. Comprehensive clinical assessments were conducted including neurological examination, neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology and vestibular function examination.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in one SAOA patient and three MSA patients. Additionally, an MSA patient had the (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;/(AAAGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype with uncertain pathogenicity. The carrier frequency for different PNRs in our cohorts was also described. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; could be associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic workflow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum of &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the same genetic background with CANVAS, which was crucial for re‐evaluating the current CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Functional Connectivity Decreases with Metabolic Stress in Sickle Cell Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25891?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25891?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience cognitive deficits even when unaffected by stroke. Using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a potential biomarker of cognitive function, we tested our hypothesis that children with SCD would have decreased functional connectivity, and that children experiencing the greatest metabolic stress, indicated by elevated oxygen extraction fraction, would have the lowest connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively obtained brain MRIs and cognitive testing in healthy controls and children with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 60 participants (20 controls and 40 with sickle cell disease). There was no difference in global cognition or cognitive subdomains between cohorts. However, we found decreased functional connectivity within the sensory‐motor, lateral sensory‐motor, auditory, salience, and subcortical networks in participants with SCD compared with controls. Further, as white matter oxygen extraction fraction increased, connectivity within the visual (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008, parameter estimate = −0.760 [95% CI = −1.297, −0.224]), default mode (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, parameter estimate = −0.417 [95% CI = −0.731, −0.104]), and cingulo‐opercular (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, parameter estimate = −0.883 [95% CI = −1.517, −0.250]) networks decreased.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that there is diminished functional connectivity within these anatomically contiguous networks in children with SCD compared with controls, even when differences are not seen with cognitive testing. Increased white matter oxygen extraction fraction was associated with decreased connectivity in select networks. These data suggest that elevated oxygen extraction fraction and disrupted functional connectivity are potentially presymptomatic neuroimaging biomarkers for cognitive decline in SCD.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07233</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown a clear relationship between sleep and memory,
examining the impact of sleep deprivation on key cognitive processes over very
short durations or in special populations. Here, we show, in a longitudinal 16
week study, that naturalistic, unfettered sleep modulations in healthy adults
have significant impacts on the brain. Using a dynamic networks approach
combined with hierarchical statistical modelling, we show that the flexibility
of particular brain regions that span a large network including regions in
occipital, temporal, and frontal cortex increased when participants performed a
working memory task following low sleep episodes. Critically, performance
itself did not change as a function of sleep, implying adaptability in brain
networks to compensate for having a poor night's sleep by recruiting the
necessary resources to complete the task. We further explore whether this
compensatory effect is driven by a (i) increase in the recruitment of network
resources over time and/or (ii) an expansion of the network itself. Our results
add to the literature linking sleep and memory, provide an analytical framework
in which to investigate compensatory modulations in the brain, and highlight
the brain's resilience to day-to-day fluctuations of external pressures to
performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spectral clustering (SC) is one of the most popular clustering methods and
often outperforms traditional clustering methods. SC uses the eigenvectors of a
Laplacian matrix calculated from a similarity matrix of a dataset. SC has
serious drawbacks that are the significant increase in the computational
complexity derived from the eigendecomposition and the memory space
complexities to store the similarity matrix. To address the issues, I develop a
new approximate spectral clustering using the network generated by growing
neural gas (GNG), called ASC with GNG in this study. The proposed method uses
not only reference vectors for vector quantization but also the topology of the
network for extraction of the topological relationship between data points in a
dataset. The similarity matrix used by ASC with GNG is made from both the
reference vectors and the topology of the network generated by GNG. Using the
network generated from a dataset by GNG, we achieve to reduce the computational
and space complexities and to improve clustering quality. This paper
demonstrates that the proposed method effectively reduces the computational
time. Moreover, the results of this study show that the proposed method
displays equal to or better performance of clustering than SC.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brains are organized into hierarchically modular networks
facilitating efficient and stable information processing and supporting diverse
cognitive processes during the course of development. While the remarkable
reconfiguration of functional brain network has been firmly established in
early life, all these studies investigated the network development from a
&quot;single-scale&quot; perspective, which ignore the richness engendered by its
hierarchical nature. To fill this gap, this paper leveraged a longitudinal
infant resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset from birth
to 2 years of age, and proposed an advanced methodological framework to
delineate the multi-scale reconfiguration of functional brain network during
early development. Our proposed framework is consist of two parts. The first
part developed a novel two-step multi-scale module detection method that could
uncover efficient and consistent modular structure for longitudinal dataset
from multiple scales in a completely data-driven manner. The second part
designed a systematic approach that employed the linear mixed-effect model to
four global and nodal module-related metrics to delineate scale-specific
age-related changes of network organization. By applying our proposed
methodological framework on the collected longitudinal infant dataset, we
provided the first evidence that, in the first 2 years of life, the brain
functional network is co-evolved at different scales, where each scale displays
the unique reconfiguration pattern in terms of modular organization.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A plethora of research advances have emerged in the fields of optics and
photonics that benefit from harnessing the power of machine learning.
Specifically, there has been a revival of interest in optical computing
hardware, due to its potential advantages for machine learning tasks in terms
of parallelization, power efficiency and computation speed. Diffractive Deep
Neural Networks (D2NNs) form such an optical computing framework, which
benefits from deep learning-based design of successive diffractive layers to
all-optically process information as the input light diffracts through these
passive layers. D2NNs have demonstrated success in various tasks, including
e.g., object classification, spectral-encoding of information, optical pulse
shaping and imaging, among others. Here, we significantly improve the inference
performance of diffractive optical networks using feature engineering and
ensemble learning. After independently training a total of 1252 D2NNs that were
diversely engineered with a variety of passive input filters, we applied a
pruning algorithm to select an optimized ensemble of D2NNs that collectively
improve their image classification accuracy. Through this pruning, we
numerically demonstrated that ensembles of N=14 and N=30 D2NNs achieve blind
testing accuracies of 61.14% and 62.13%, respectively, on the classification of
CIFAR-10 test images, providing an inference improvement of &amp;gt;16% compared to
the average performance of the individual D2NNs within each ensemble. These
results constitute the highest inference accuracies achieved to date by any
diffractive optical neural network design on the same dataset and might provide
a significant leapfrog to extend the application space of diffractive optical

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biological neural networks operate with extraordinary energy efficiency,
owing to properties such as spike-based communication and synaptic plasticity
driven by local activity. When emulated in silico, such properties also enable
highly energy-efficient machine learning and inference systems. However, it is
unclear whether these mechanisms only trade off performance for efficiency or
rather they are partly responsible for the superiority of biological
intelligence. Here, we first address this theoretically, proving rigorously
that indeed the optimal prediction and inference of randomly but continuously
transforming environments, a common natural setting, relies on adaptivity
through short-term spike-timing dependent plasticity, a hallmark of biological
neural networks. Secondly, we assess this theoretical optimality via
simulations and also demonstrate improved artificial intelligence (AI). For the
first time, a largely biologically modelled spiking neural network (SNN)
surpasses state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) in all relevant
aspects, in an example task of recognizing video frames transformed by moving
occlusions. The SNN recognizes the frames more accurately, even if trained on
few, still, and untransformed images, with unsupervised and synaptically-local
learning, binary spikes, and a single layer of neurons - all in contrast to the
deep-learning-trained ANNs. These results indicate that on-line adaptivity and
spike-based computation may optimize natural intelligence for natural
environments. Moreover, this expands the goal of exploiting biological
neuro-synaptic properties for AI, from mere efficiency, to computational
supremacy altogether.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Variable Binding for Sparse Distributed Representations: Theory and Applications. (arXiv:2009.06734v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Symbolic reasoning and neural networks are often considered incompatible
approaches. Connectionist models known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs)
can potentially bridge this gap. However, classical VSAs and neural networks
are still considered incompatible. VSAs encode symbols by dense pseudo-random
vectors, where information is distributed throughout the entire neuron
population. Neural networks encode features locally, often forming sparse
vectors of neural activation. Following Rachkovskij (2001); Laiho et al.
(2015), we explore symbolic reasoning with sparse distributed representations.
The core operations in VSAs are dyadic operations between vectors to express
variable binding and the representation of sets. Thus, algebraic manipulations
enable VSAs to represent and process data structures in a vector space of fixed
dimensionality. Using techniques from compressed sensing, we first show that
variable binding between dense vectors in VSAs is mathematically equivalent to
tensor product binding between sparse vectors, an operation which increases
dimensionality. This result implies that dimensionality-preserving binding for
general sparse vectors must include a reduction of the tensor matrix into a
single sparse vector. Two options for sparsity-preserving variable binding are
investigated. One binding method for general sparse vectors extends earlier
proposals to reduce the tensor product into a vector, such as circular
convolution. The other method is only defined for sparse block-codes,
block-wise circular convolution. Our experiments reveal that variable binding
for block-codes has ideal properties, whereas binding for general sparse
vectors also works, but is lossy, similar to previous proposals. We demonstrate
a VSA with sparse block-codes in example applications, cognitive reasoning and
classification, and discuss its relevance for neuroscience and neural networks.

Here, the authors identify IRF1-PGC1α axis-mediated myocardial energy metabolism remodeling as a contributor to CRS4 pathogenesis, thus providing potential new targets for reducing cardiovascular events in CKD patients.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/Y3WLq732bbc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Here, the authors identify RREB1 underlying a 6p microdeletion RASopathy-like syndrome and show that RREB1, SIN3A and KDM1A form a transcriptional repressive complex to control methylation of MAPK pathway genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/jH2wUo85gYc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Here, the authors compare human RNASeq patient data from DFU, oral mucosa and skin acute wounds, identifying FOXM1 as a mediator of macrophage and neutrophil recruitment, which contributes to disease pathogenesis and is dysregulated in patients.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/gYVkDgxHeuY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Paramagnetic Metal Accumulation in the Deep Gray Matter Nuclei Is Associated With Neurodegeneration in Wilson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.573633</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Neuropathological studies have revealed copper and iron accumulation in the deep gray matter (DGM) nuclei of patients with Wilson’s disease (WD). However, the association between metal accumulation and neurodegeneration in WD has not been well studied in vivo. The study was aimed to investigate whether metal accumulation in the DGM was associated with the structural and functional changes of DGM in neurological WD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventeen neurological WD patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Mean bulk susceptibility values and volumes of DGM were obtained from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Regions of interest including the head of the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus were manually segmented. The susceptibility values and volumes of DGM in different groups were compared using a linear regression model. Correlations between susceptibility values and volumes of DGM and Unified Wilson’s Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) neurological subscores were investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The susceptibility values of all examined DGM in WD patients were higher than those in healthy controls (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Volume reductions were observed in the head of the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, and substantia nigra of WD patients (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Susceptibility values were negatively correlated with the volumes of the head of the caudate nucleus (r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.657, P = 0.037), putamen (r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.667, P = 0.037), and thalamus (r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.613, P = 0.046) in WD patients. UWDRS neurological subscores were positively correlated with the susceptibility values of all examined DGM. The susceptibility values of putamen, head of the caudate nucleus, and dentate nucleus could well predict UWDRS neurological subscores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study provided in vivo evidence that paramagnetic metal accumulation in the DGM was associated with DGM atrophy and neurological impairment. The susceptibility of DGM could be used as a biomarker to assess the severity of neurodegeneration in WD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Initial Experience of Challenge-Free MRI-Based Oxygen Extraction Fraction Mapping of Ischemic Stroke at Various Stages: Comparison With Perfusion and Diffusion Mapping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.535441</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;MRI-based oxygen extraction fraction imaging has a great potential benefit in the selection of clinical strategies for ischemic stroke patients. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a challenge-free oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) mapping in a cohort of acute and subacute ischemic stroke patients. Consecutive ischemic stroke patients (a total of 30 with 5 in the acute stage, 19 in the early subacute stage, and 6 in the late subacute stage) were recruited. All subjects underwent MRI including multi-echo gradient echo (mGRE), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and 3D-arterial spin labeling (ASL). OEF maps were generated from mGRE phase + magnitude data, which were processed using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) + quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent (qBOLD) imaging with cluster analysis of time evolution. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reconstructed from 3D-ASL and DWI, respectively. Further, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated as the product of CBF and OEF. OEF, CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CBF, and ADC values in the ischemic cores (absolute values) and their contrasts to the contralateral regions (relative values) were evaluated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare OEF, CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CBF, and ADC values and their relative values among different stroke stages. The OEF value of infarct core showed a trend of decrease from acute, to early subacute, and to late subacute stages of ischemic stroke. Significant differences among the three stroke stages were only observed in the absolute OEF (F = 6.046, p = 0.005) and relative OEF (F = 5.699, p = 0.009) values of the ischemic core, but not in other measurements (absolute and relative CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CBF, ADC values, all values of p &amp;gt; 0.05). In conclusion, the challenge-free QSM + qBOLD-generated OEF mapping can be performed on stroke patients. It can provide more information on tissue viability that was not available with CBF and ADC and, thus, may help to better manage ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Movement Kinematics and Interjoint Coordination Are Influenced by Target Location and Arm in 6-Year-Old Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.554378</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rapid aiming movements are typically used to study upper limb motor control and development. Despite the large corpus of work in this area, few studies have examined kinematic manual asymmetries in children who have just started formal schooling and until now, none have characterized how children coordinate their joints to complete these movements (i.e., interjoint coordination). In the present study, manual asymmetries in kinematics and interjoint coordination in strongly right-handed 6-year-old children were investigated when reaching for ipsilateral and contralateral targets with their dominant right arm and the non-dominant left arm. Overall, manual asymmetries in interjoint coordination are apparent for both 6-year-old children and young adults, although young children completed the task by adopting a different strategy than adults. Also, control strategies employed by 6-year-old children were influenced by both the location of the target as well as the arm used to perform the task. Specifically, compared to all other conditions, children’s trajectories were more curved when performing contralateral movements with the non-dominant left arm, which were driven by smaller shoulder excursions combined with larger elbow excursions for this condition. Based on these results, we argue that the differences in interjoint coordination reflect the stage of development of 6-year-old children, the origin of which derives from maturational (e.g., hand dominance) and environmental factors (e.g., school-based experience).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Dendritic Spine Formation in the Hippocampus and Animal Behaviors in a Mouse Model of Hyperthyroidism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00268</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00268</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Thyroid hormones are critical for the regulation of development and differentiation of neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). We have previously reported the sex-dependent changes of glial morphology in the brain under the state of hyperthyroidism. Here, we examined sex-dependent changes in spine structure of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus in male and female mice with hyperthyroidism. Using FIB/SEM (focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy), three-dimensional reconstructed structures of dendritic spines in dentate granule cells were analyzed. Dendritic spine density in granule cells increased significantly in both male and female mice with hyperthyroidism. The decrease in spine volume was observed only in female mice. These findings suggest that hyperthyroidism induces the formation of spines with normal size in male mice but the formation of spines with small size in female mice. To evaluate an outcome of neuronal and previously observed glial changes, behavioral tests were performed. Male mice with hyperthyroidism showed increased locomotor activity in the open field test, while female mice showed elevated immobility time in the tail suspension test, reflecting depression-like behavior. Although direct link between changes in spine and behavioral modifications requires further analysis, our results may help to understand gender-dependent neurological and psychological symptoms observed in patients with hyperthyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Morphologic Characterization of Trigeminothalamic Terminal Arbors Arising From the Principal Nucleus in the Macaque</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.562673</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) is amandatory relay for orofacial sensory information targeting the primary somatosensory cortex. We characterized the morphology of VPM axons arising in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (pV) through injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) placed in pV of Macaca fascicularis and mulatta monkeys. Labeled terminals formed a patchy bilateral distribution. Within contralateral VPM, patches were found primarily, but not exclusively, within the laterally located, vertical segment, and in ipsilateral VPM, primarily, but not exclusively, in the medially located, horizontal segment. Two fiber types were labeled: thin and thick. Thin fibers were poorly branched and diffusely distributed. They were studded with small en passant boutons. Most labeled fibers were thick and they branched extensively to form distinctive terminal arbors decorated with numerous boutons that varied in size and shape. Quantitative analysis of thick fiber arbor features showed little difference between the sides, although contralateral boutons were significantly larger than ipsilateral ones. Bouton distribution with respect to counterstained somata suggests that proximal dendrites are their main target. Indeed, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that they provide large diameter dendrites with numerous contacts. Direct comparison of thick fiber terminal arbors to cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining revealed that these arbors are much smaller than individual CO-rich patches believed to designate rods containing discrete body area representations. Thus, each terminal arbor appears to heavily innervate a small number of VPM neurons within a rod. This relationship would serve to maintain relatively small receptive fields within the topographic representation of the face.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: White Matter Integrity Is Associated With the Amount of Physical Activity in Older Adults With Super-aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.549983</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.549983</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have introduced the concept of “SuperAgers,” defined as older adults with youthful memory performance associated with the increased cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex. Given that age-related structural brain changes are observed earlier in the white matter (WM) than in the cortical areas, we investigated whether WM integrity is different between the SuperAgers (SA) and typical agers (TA) and whether it is associated with superior memory performance as well as a healthy lifestyle. A total of 35 SA and 55 TA were recruited for this study. Further, 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological tests, and lifestyle factors related to cognitive function, such as physical activity and duration of sleep, were evaluated in all participants. SA was defined as individuals demonstrating the youthful performance of verbal and visual memory, as measured by the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), respectively. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis was used to compare the diffusion values such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) between the SA and TA. SA exhibited better performance in memory, attention, visuospatial, and frontal executive functions than the TA did. SA also exhibited greater amounts of physical activity than the TA did. As compared to TA, SA demonstrated higher FA with lower MD, RD, and AD in the corpus callosum and higher FA and lower RD in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), which is significantly associated with memory function. Interestingly, FA values of the body of corpus callosum were correlated with the amount of physical activity. Our findings suggest that WM integrity of the corpus callosum is associated with superior memory function and a higher level of physical activities in SA compared to TA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Optogenetic activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by LOV2GIVe, a rationally engineered modular protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60155</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60155</link>
	<description>Heterotrimeric G-proteins are signal transducers involved in mediating the action of many natural extracellular stimuli as well as of many therapeutic agents. Non-invasive approaches to manipulate the activity of G-proteins with high precision are crucial to understand their regulation in space and time. Here, we developed LOV2GIVe, an engineered modular protein that allows the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins with blue light. This optogenetic construct relies on a versatile design that differs from tools previously developed for similar purposes, i.e. metazoan opsins, which are light-activated GPCRs. Instead, LOV2GIVe consists of the fusion of a G-protein activating peptide derived from a non-GPCR regulator of G-proteins to a small plant protein domain, such that light uncages the G-protein activating module. Targeting LOV2GIVe to cell membranes allowed for light-dependent activation of Gi proteins in different experimental systems. In summary, LOV2GIVe expands the armamentarium and versatility of tools available to manipulate heterotrimeric G-protein activity.</description>

	<title>eLife: IER5, a DNA damage response gene, is required for Notch-mediated induction of squamous cell differentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58081</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58081</link>
	<description>Notch signaling regulates squamous cell proliferation and differentiation and is frequently disrupted in squamous cell carcinomas, in which Notch is tumor suppressive. Here, we show that conditional activation of Notch in squamous cells activates a context-specific gene expression program through lineage-specific regulatory elements. Among direct Notch target genes are multiple DNA damage response genes, including &lt;i&gt;IER5&lt;/i&gt;, which we show is required for Notch-induced differentiation of squamous carcinoma cells and TERT-immortalized keratinocytes. &lt;i&gt;IER5&lt;/i&gt; is epistatic to &lt;i&gt;PPP2R2A&lt;/i&gt;, a gene that encodes the PP2A B55a subunit, which we show interacts with IER5 in cells and in purified systems. Thus, Notch and DNA-damage response pathways converge in squamous cells on common genes that promote differentiation, which may serve to eliminate damaged cells from the proliferative pool. We further propose that crosstalk involving Notch and PP2A enables tuning and integration of Notch signaling with other pathways that regulate squamous differentiation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Wnt effector TCF7l2 promotes oligodendroglial differentiation by repressing autocrine BMP4-mediated signaling</title>

	<description>Promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation represents a promising option for remyelination therapy for treating the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). The Wnt effector TCF7l2 was upregulated in MS lesions and had been proposed to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation. Recent data suggest the opposite yet underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we unravel a previously unappreciated function of TCF7l2 in controlling autocrine bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4)-mediated signaling. Disrupting TCF7l2 results in oligodendroglial-specific BMP4 upregulation and canonical BMP4 signaling activation in vivo. Mechanistically, TCF7l2 binds to Bmp4 gene regulatory element and directly represses its transcriptional activity. Functionally, enforced TCF7l2 expression promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation by reducing autocrine BMP4 secretion and dampening BMP4 signaling. Importantly, compound genetic disruption demonstrates that oligodendroglial-specific BMP4 deletion rescues arrested oligodendrocyte differentiation elicited by TCF7l2 disruption in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals a novel connection between TCF7l2 and BMP4 in oligodendroglial lineage and provides new insights into augmenting TCF7l2 for promoting remyelination in demyelinating disorders such as MS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Rhythmic expression of Neurofibromin 1 in mushroom body neurons mediates circadian wake drive through activating cAMP-PKA signaling</title>

	<description>Various behavioral and cognitive states exhibit circadian variations in animals across phyla including Drosophila, in which only ~0.1% of the entire brain neurons contain circadian clocks. This suggests that clock neurons communicate with a plethora of non-clock neurons to transmit the timing information to gate various behavioral outputs in Drosophila. Here, we address the molecular underpinning of this phenomenon by performing circadian RNA-seq analysis of non-clock neurons that constitute the mushroom body (MB), the center of information processing and sleep regulation. We identify hundreds of genes rhythmically expressed in the MB, including the Drosophila ortholog of Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1), the gene responsible for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Rhythmic expression of Nf1 promotes daytime wakefulness by activating cAMP-PKA signaling and increasing excitability of the MB. These findings reveal the pervasive, non-cell-autonomous circadian regulation of gene expression in the brain and its role in sleep, with implications in the pathology of NF1.</description>

	<description>Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation via reactivation of prior experiences, with particular electrophysiological sleep signatures (slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles) gating the information flow between relevant brain areas. However, empirical evidence for a role of endogenous memory reactivation (i.e., without experimentally delivered memory cues) for consolidation in humans is lacking. Here, we devised a paradigm in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. Multivariate decoding was then used to capture endogenous memory reactivation during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Results revealed reactivation of learning material during SO-spindle complexes, with the precision of SO-spindle coupling predicting reactivation strength. Critically, reactivation strength in turn predicted the level of consolidation across participants. These results elucidate the memory function of sleep in humans and emphasize the importance of SOs and spindles in clocking endogenous consolidation processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Mimicry is associated with procedural learning, not social bonding, neural systems in autism</title>

	<description>Mimicry facilitates social bonding throughout the lifespan. Mimicry impairments in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are widely reported, including differentiation of the brain networks associated with its social bonding and learning functions. This study examined associations between volumes of brain regions associated with social bonding versus procedural skill learning, and mimicry of gestures during a naturalistic interaction in ASC and neurotypical (NT) children. Consistent with predictions, results revealed reduced mimicry in ASC relative to the NT children. Mimicry frequency was negatively associated with autism symptom severity. Mimicry was predicted predominantly by the volume of procedural skill learning regions in ASC, and by bonding regions in NT. Further, bonding regions contributed significantly less to mimicry in ASC than in NT, while the contribution of learning regions was not different across groups. These findings suggest that associating mimicry with skill learning, rather than social bonding, may partially explain observed communication difficulties in ASC.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Mean-field modeling of brain-scale dynamics for the evaluation of EEG source-space networks</title>

	<description>Understanding the dynamics of brain-scale functional networks at rest and during cognitive tasks is the subject of intense research efforts to unveil fundamental principles of brain functions. To estimate these large-scale brain networks, the emergent method called electroencephalography (EEG) source connectivity has generated increasing interest in the network neuroscience community, due to its ability to identify cortical brain networks with good spatio-temporal resolution, while reducing mixing and volume conduction effects. However, the method is still immature and several methodological issues should be carefully accounted for to avoid pitfalls. Therefore, optimizing the EEG source connectivity pipelines is required, which involves the evaluation of several parameters. One key issue to address those evaluation aspects is the availability of a ground truth. In this paper, we show how a recently developed large-scale model of brain-scale activity, named COALIA, can provide to some extent such ground truth by providing realistic simulations (epileptiform activity) of source-level and scalp-level activity. Using a bottom-up approach, the model bridges cortical micro-circuitry and large-scale network dynamics. Here, we provide an example of the potential use of COALIA to analyze the effect of three key factors involved in the EEG source connectivity pipeline: (i) EEG sensors density, (ii) algorithm used to solve the inverse problem, and (iii) functional connectivity measure. Results show that a high electrode density (at least 64 channels) is needed to accurately estimate cortical networks. Regarding the inverse solution/connectivity measure combination, the best performance at high electrode density was obtained using the weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE) combined with the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). The COALIA model and the simulations used in this paper are freely available and made accessible for the community. We believe that this model-based approach will help researchers to address some current and future cognitive and clinical neuroscience questions, and ultimately transform EEG brain network imaging into a mature technology.</description>

	<description>Endogenous brain processes play a paramount role in shaping up perceptual phenomenology, as illustrated by the alternations experienced by humans (and other animals) when watching perceptually ambiguous, static images. Here, we hypothesised that endogenous alpha fluctuations in the visual cortex pace the accumulation of sensory information leading to perceptual outcomes. We addressed this hypothesis using binocular rivalry combined with visual entrainment and electroencephalography in humans (42 female, 40 male). The results revealed a correlation between the individual frequency of alpha oscillations in the occipital cortex and perceptual alternation rates experienced during binocular rivalry. In subsequent experiments we show that regulating endogenous brain activity via entrainment produced corresponding changes in perceptual alternation rate, which were observed only in the alpha range but not at lower entrainment frequencies. Overall, rhythmic alpha stimulation resulted in faster perceptual alternation rates, compared to arrhythmic or no stimulation. These findings support the notion that visual information is accumulated via alpha cycles to promote the emergence of conscious perceptual representations. We suggest that models of binocular rivalry incorporating posterior alpha as a pacemaker can provide an important advance in the comprehension of the dynamics of visual awareness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Disruption of Glial Ca2+ Oscillations at the Drosophila Blood-Brain Barrier Predisposes to Seizure-Like Behavior</title>

	<description>Glia play key roles in regulating multiple aspects of neuronal development and function from invertebrates to humans. We recently found microdomain Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila cortex glia and astrocytes regulate extracellular K+ buffering and neurotransmitter uptake, respectively. Here we identify a role for ER store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in perineurial glia (PG), a distinct population that contributes to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). PG show a diverse range of Ca2+ oscillatory activity that varies based on their locale within the brain. Unlike cortex glia and astrocytes, PG Ca2+ oscillations do not require extracellular Ca2+ and are blocked by inhibition of SOCE or gap junctions. Disruption of these components triggers heat shock and mechanical-induced seizure-like episodes without effecting PG morphology or large molecule BBB permeability. These findings indicate SOCE-mediated Ca2+ oscillations in PG increase the susceptibility of seizure-like episodes in Drosophila, providing an additional link between glial Ca2+ signaling and neuronal activity.</description>

	<description>The imaging of neuronal activity using calcium indicators has become a staple of modern neuroscience. However, without ground truths, there is a real risk of missing a significant portion of the real responses. Here, we show that a common assumption, the non-negativity of the neuronal responses as detected by calcium indicators, biases all levels of the frequently used analytical methods for these data. From the extraction of meaningful fluorescence changes to spike inference and the analysis of inferred spikes, each step risks missing real responses because of the assumption of non-negativity. We first show that negative deviations from baseline can exist in calcium imaging of neuronal activity. Then, we use simulated data to test three popular algorithms for image analysis, finding that suite2p may be the best suited to large datasets. Spike inference algorithms also showed their limitations in dealing with inhibited neurons, and new approaches may be needed to address this problem. We further suggest avoiding data analysis approaches that may ignore inhibited responses in favor of a first exploratory step to ensure that none are present. Taking these steps will ensure that inhibition, as well as excitation, is detected in calcium imaging datasets.</description>

	<description>The spatial accuracy of TMS may be as small as a few millimeters. Despite such great potential, navigated TMS (nTMS) mapping is still underused for the assessment of motor plasticity, particularly in clinical settings. Here we investigate the within-limb somatotopy gradient as well as absolute and relative reliability of three hand muscle cortical representations (MCRs) using a comprehensive grid-based sulcus-informed nTMS motor mapping. We enrolled 22 young healthy male volunteers. Two nTMS mapping sessions were separated by 5-10 days. Motor evoked potentials were obtained from abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi, and extensor digitorum communis. In addition to individual MRI-based analysis, we studied MNI normalized MCRs. For the reliability assessment, we calculated intra-class correlation and the smallest detectable change. Our results revealed a somatotopy gradient reflected by APB MCR having the most lateral location. Reliability analysis showed that the commonly used metrics of MCRs, such as areas, volumes, centers of gravity (COGs), and hotspots had a high relative and low absolute reliability for all three muscles. For within-limb TMS somatotopy, the most common metrics such as the shifts between MCR COGs and hotspots had poor relative reliability. However, overlaps between different muscle MCRs were highly reliable. We thus provide novel evidence that inter-muscle MCR interaction can be reliably traced using MCR overlaps while shifts between the COGs and hotspots of different MCRs are not suitable for this purpose. Our results have implications for the interpretation of nTMS motor mapping results in healthy subjects and patients with neurological conditions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Latency and amplitude of the stop-signal P3 event-related potential are related to inhibitory GABAa activity in primary motor cortex</title>

	<description>By stopping actions even after their initiation, humans can adapt their ongoing behavior rapidly to changing environmental circumstances. The neural processes underlying the implementation of rapid action-stopping are still controversially discussed. In the early 1990s, a fronto-central P3 event-related potential (ERP) was identified in the human EEG response following stop-signals in the classic stop-signal task, accompanied by the proposal that this ERP reflects the 'inhibitory' side of the purported horse-race underlying successful action-stopping. Later studies have lent support to this interpretation by finding that the amplitude and onset of the stop-signal P3 relate to both overt behavior and to movement-related EEG activity in ways predicted by the race model. However, such studies are limited by the ability of EEG to allow direct inferences about the presence (or absence) of true, physiologically inhibitory signaling at the neuronal level. To address this, we here present a cross-modal individual differences investigation of the relationship between the features stop-signal P3 ERP and GABAergic neurotransmission in primary motor cortex (M1, as measured by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation). Following recent work, we measured short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), a marker of inhibitory GABAa activity in M1, in a group of 41 human participants who also performed the stop-signal task while undergoing EEG recordings. In line with the P3-inhibition hypothesis, we found that subjects with stronger inhibitory GABA activity in M1 also showed both faster onsets and larger amplitudes of the stop-signal P3. This provides direct evidence linking the properties of this ERP to a true physiological index of motor system inhibition. We discuss these findings in the context of recent theoretical developments and empirical findings regarding the neural implementation of inhibitory control during action-stopping.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neural selectivity for visual motion in macaque area V3A</title>

	<description>The processing of visual motion is carried out by dedicated pathways in the primate brain. These pathways originate with populations of direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex, which project to dorsal structures like the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas. Anatomical and imaging studies have suggested that area V3A might also be specialized for motion processing, but there have been very few studies of single-neuron direction selectivity in this area. We have therefore performed electrophysiological recordings from V3A neurons in two macaque monkeys (one male and one female) and measured responses to a large battery of motion stimuli that includes translation motion, as well as more complex optic flow patterns. For comparison, we simultaneously recorded the responses of MT neurons to the same stimuli. Surprisingly, we find that overall levels of direction selectivity are similar in V3A and MT and moreover that the population of V3A neurons exhibits somewhat greater selectivity for optic flow patterns. These results suggest that V3A should be considered as part of the motion processing machinery of the visual cortex, in both human and non-human primates.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Predicting MEG resting-state functional connectivity using microstructural information</title>

	<description>Understanding the role that human brain microstructure plays in the formation of functional connectivity is an important endeavor that could inform therapies for patients with neurological disorders. In this work, magnetic resonance imaging data from ninety healthy participants were used to perform tractography and calculate structural connectivity matrices, using four microstructural metrics to assign connection strength: number of streamlines, fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and a myelin measure (derived from the myelin water fraction computed from multi-component relaxometry). Unweighted binarized structural connectivity matrices, marking with 1 existing structural connections and with 0 non-existing ones, and assigning no specific strength to the connections, were also constructed. Magnetoencephalography resting-state data from the same participants were used to calculate their functional connectivity matrices, via correlations of the Hilbert envelopes of the beamformer time series, at four frequency bands: delta (1 - 4 Hz), theta (3 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz). Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was then performed to identify the components of the observed resting-state functional connectivity in those bands. Shortest-path-length and search-information analyses of the structural connectomes were used to predict functional connectivity patterns for both the total resting-state functional connectivity and its NMF components. The observed functional connectivity was stronger for brain areas that were closer to each other. The microstructurally-informed algorithms predicted the NMF-derived components of the observed functional connectivity more accurately than they predicted the total (non-factorized) observed functional connectivity. The shortest-path-length algorithm outperformed the search- information algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy. When comparing the weights of the structural connectivity matrices, the number of streamlines and the myelin measure gave the most accurate predictions of functional connectivity, while the fractional anisotropy consistently performed poorly. Overall, different structural metrics paint very different pictures of the human structural connectome, of its relationship to functional connectivity, and of which white matter tracts are implicated in the communication between brain areas.</description>

	<description>Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) can enhance vision in the healthy and diseased brain. Yet, the impact of tRNS on large-scale cortical networks is still unknown. We investigated the impact of tRNS coupled with behavioral training on resting-state functional connectivity and attention. We trained human subjects for four consecutive days on two attention tasks, while receiving tRNS over the intraparietal sulci, the middle temporal areas, or sham stimulation. We measured resting state functional connectivity of nodes of the dorsal and ventral attention network (DVAN) before and after training. We found a strong behavioral improvement and increased connectivity within the DVAN after parietal stimulation only. Crucially, behavioral improvement positively correlated with connectivity measures. We conclude changes in connectivity is a marker for the enduring effect of tRNS upon behavior. Our results suggest that tRNS has strong potential to augment cognitive capacity in healthy individuals and promote recovery in the neurological population.</description>

	<description>The brains functional architecture changes considerably across multiple timescales. While the role of variations over long timescales (e.g., years) is widely documented, the functional relevance of microtemporal (i.e., second-level) fluctuations is still debated. Using fMRI data collected during movie watching from two independent samples, we demonstrate that the adaptiveness of variability in functional brain architecture fluctuates across the adult lifespan (18-88 years) due to age-related differences in the associated profiles of network communication. Greater coupling between changes in brain architecture and concrete environmental features is stronger at younger ages and linked to poorer cognitive-affective outcomes. Whole-brain communication pathways anchored in regions key to episodic and semantic context creation contribute to greater brain reconfiguration in response to abstract contextual changes and stronger coupling between changes in brain architecture and concrete environmental features. Our results provide new insights into age-related differences in brain-environment alignment and their relevance to cognitive adaptability and psychopathology.</description>

	<description>Interactions of large numbers of spiking neurons give rise to complex neural dynamics with fluctuations occurring at multiple scales. Understanding the dynamical mechanisms underlying such complex neural dynamics is a long-standing topic of interest in neuroscience, statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics. Conventionally, fluctuating neural dynamics are formulated as balanced, uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory inputs with Gaussian properties. However, heterogeneous, non-Gaussian properties have been widely observed in both neural connections and neural dynamics. Here, based on balanced neural networks with heterogeneous, non-Gaussian features, our analysis reveals that in the limit of large network size, synaptic inputs possess power-law fluctuations, leading to a remarkable relation of complex neural dynamics to the fractional diffusion formalisms of non-equilibrium physical systems. By uniquely accounting for the leapovers caused by the fluctuations of spiking activity, we further develop a fractional Fokker-Planck equation with absorbing boundary conditions. This body of formalisms represents a novel fractional diffusion theory of heterogeneous neural networks and results in an exact description of the network activity states. This theory is further implemented in a biologically plausible, balanced neural network and identifies a novel type of network state with rich, nonlinear response properties, providing a unified account of a variety of experimental findings on neural dynamics at the individual neuron and the network levels, including fluctuations of membrane potentials and population firing rates. We illustrate that this novel state endows neural networks with a fundamental computational advantage; that is, the neural response is maximised as a function of structural connectivity. Our theory and its network implementations provide a framework for investigating complex neural dynamics emerging from large networks of spiking neurons and their functional roles in neural processing.</description>

	<description>How does spontaneous activity during development prepare cortico-cortical connections for sensory input? We here analyse the development of sequence memory, an intrinsic feature of recurrent networks that supports temporal perception. We use a recurrent neural network model with homeostatic and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). This model has been shown to learn specific sequences from structured input. We show that development even under unstructured input increases unspecific sequence memory. Moreover, networks pre-shaped by such unstructured input subsequently learn specific sequences faster. The key structural substrate is the emergence of strong and directed synapses due to STDP and synaptic competition. These construct self-amplifying preferential paths of activity, which can quickly encode new input sequences. Our results suggest that memory traces are not printed on a tabula rasa, but instead harness building blocks already present in the brain.</description>

	<description>Individual human brains plastically reorganize over extended timescales ranging from days to years, which makes these changes difficult to track. One promising tracking indicator is the neural activity at rest. However, the rest state (RS) is vulnerable to incidental inter-day cognitive variability that can confound the detection of changes to underlying neurophysiology. Here we show that this confounding is minimized by tracking changes to the distinctiveness of an individuals RS activity, which is shaped by individual neurophysiology. Using longitudinal (5-day)RS acquired with EEG, we devised empirical simulations of distinctiveness changes confounded by cognitive variation. These inter-day changes were correctly classified with over 96% accuracy from 2-second snapshots of instantaneous oscillatory power from RS and confounded-RS. Surprisingly, the individual indicators of distinctiveness were concentrated at characteristic fronto-central and occipital zones. These findings support the suitability of longitudinal RS for individualized inferences about neurophysiological change in health and disease.</description>

	<description>We have identified the brain areas involved in Manual Preference (MP) in 143 left-handers (LH) and 144 right-handers (RH)). First, we selected the pairs of homotopic regions of interest (hROIs) of the AICHA atlas with significant contralateral activation and asymmetry during the right-hand and the left-hand Finger-Tapping (FT) both in RH and LH. Thirteen hROIs were selected, including the primary and secondary sensorimotor, and premotor cortices, thalamus, dorsal putamen and cerebellar lobule IV. Both contralateral activations and ipsilateral deactivations (reversed for the cerebellum) were seen in primary motor and somatosensory areas, with stronger asymmetries when the preferred hand was used. Comparing the prediction of MP with different combinations of BOLD variations in these 13 hROIs, the differences between movement of the preferred hand versus that of the non- preferred hand within the contralateral and/or ipsilateral cortices of 11 hROIS performed best at explaining handedness distribution, Handedness is thus supported by: 1- between-hand variations of ipsilateral deactivations of hand primary sensorimotor and secondary somatosensory cortices and 2- variations in regions showing the same profile in left and right-handers during the right or left FT. The present study demonstrates that right and left- handedness are not based on mirrored organization of hand control areas.</description>

	<description>The hexanucleotide G4C2 repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene explains the majority of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases. Numerous studies have indicated the toxicity of dipeptide repeats (DPRs) which are produced via repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation from the repeat expansion and accumulate in the brain of C9FTD/ALS patients. Mouse models expressing the human C9ORF72 repeat and/or DPRs show variable pathological, functional and behavioral characteristics of FTD and ALS. Here, we report a new Tet-on inducible mouse model that expresses 36x pure G4C2 repeats with 100bp upstream and downstream human flanking regions. Brain specific expression causes the formation of sporadic sense DPRs aggregates upon 6 months dox induction but no apparent neurodegeneration. Expression in the rest of the body evokes abundant sense DPRs in multiple organs, leading to weight loss, neuromuscular junction disruption, myopathy and a locomotor phenotype within the time frame of four weeks. We did not observe any RNA foci or pTDP-43 pathology. Accumulation of DPRs and the myopathy phenotype could be prevented when 36x G4C2 repeat expression was stopped after 1 week. After 2 weeks of expression, the phenotype could not be reversed, even though DPR levels were reduced. In conclusion, expression of 36x pure G4C2 repeats including 100bp human flanking regions is sufficient for RAN translation of sense DPRs and evokes a functional locomotor phenotype. Our inducible mouse model highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for C9FTD/ALS patients.</description>

	<description>Many different functions are regulated by circadian rhythms, including those orchestrated by discrete clock neurons within animal brains. To comprehensively characterize and assign cell identity to the 75 pairs of Drosophila circadian neurons, we optimized a single cell RNA sequencing method and assayed clock neuron gene expression at different times of day. The data identify at least 17 clock neuron categories with striking spatial regulation of gene expression. Transcription factor regulation is prominent and likely contributes to the robust circadian oscillation of many transcripts, including those that encode cell-surface proteins previously shown to be important for cell recognition and synapse formation during development. We suggest that these molecules orchestrate the temporal regulation of synapse formation and/or strength. The many other clock-regulated genes also constitute an important resource for future mechanistic and functional studies between clock neurons and/or for temporal signaling to circuits elsewhere in the fly brain.</description>

	<description>Opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a leading cause of death in the US, yet current therapeutic strategies remain highly inadequate. To identify novel potential treatments for OUD, we screened a targeted selection of over 100 drugs, using a recently developed opioid self-administration assay in zebrafish. This paradigm showed that finasteride, a steroidogenesis inhibitor approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenetic alopecia, reduced self-administration of multiple opioids without affecting locomotion or feeding behavior. These findings were confirmed in rats; furthermore, finasteride did not interfere with the antinociceptive effect of opioids in rat models of neuropathic pain. Steroidomic analyses of the brains of fish treated with finasteride revealed a significant increase in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Treatment with precursors of DHEAS reduced opioid self-administration in zebrafish, in a fashion akin to the effects of finasteride. Our results highlight the importance of steroidogenic pathways as a rich source of therapeutic targets for OUD and point to the potential of finasteride as a new option for this disorder.</description>

Calcium imaging with fluorescent protein sensors is widely used to record activity in neuronal populations. The transform between neural activity and calcium-related fluorescence involves nonlinearities and low-pass filtering, but the effects of the transformation on analyses of neural populations are not well understood. We compared neuronal spikes and fluorescence in matched neural populations in behaving mice. We report multiple discrepancies between analyses performed on the two types of data, including changes in single-neuron selectivity and population decoding. These were only partially resolved by spike inference algorithms applied to fluorescence. To model the relation between spiking and fluorescence we simultaneously recorded spikes and fluorescence from individual neurons. Using these recordings we developed a model transforming spike trains to synthetic-imaging data. The model recapitulated the differences in analyses. Our analysis highlights challenges in relating electrophysiology and imaging data, and suggests forward modeling as an effective way to understand differences between these data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfFiXxFx2eI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances in experimental biology allow creation of datasets where several genome-wide data types (called omics) are measured per sample. Integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets in general, and clustering of samples in such datasets specifically, can improve our understanding of biological processes and discover different disease subtypes. In this work we present MONET (Multi Omic clustering by Non-Exhaustive Types), which presents a unique approach to multi-omic clustering. MONET discovers modules of similar samples, such that each module is allowed to have a clustering structure for only a subset of the omics. This approach differs from most existent multi-omic clustering algorithms, which assume a common structure across all omics, and from several recent algorithms that model distinct cluster structures. We tested MONET extensively on simulated data, on an image dataset, and on ten multi-omic cancer datasets from TCGA. Our analysis shows that MONET compares favorably with other multi-omic clustering methods. We demonstrate MONET's biological and clinical relevance by analyzing its results for Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma. We also show that MONET is robust to missing data, can cluster genes in multi-omic dataset, and reveal modules of cell types in single-cell multi-omic data. Our work shows that MONET is a valuable tool that can provide complementary results to those provided by existent algorithms for multi-omic analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ML7KYz11EQ0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Centrioles are amplified in cycling progenitors of olfactory sensory neurons</title>

Olfaction in most animals is mediated by neurons bearing cilia that are accessible to the environment. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in chordates usually have multiple cilia, each with a centriole at its base. OSNs differentiate from stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, and how the epithelium generates cells with many centrioles is not yet understood. We show that centrioles are amplified via centriole rosette formation in both embryonic development and turnover of the olfactory epithelium in adult mice, and rosette-bearing cells often have free centrioles in addition. Cells with amplified centrioles can go on to divide, with centrioles clustered at each pole. Additionally, we found that centrioles are amplified in immediate neuronal precursors (INPs) concomitant with elevation of mRNA for polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and SCL/Tal1-interrupting locus gene (Stil), key regulators of centriole duplication. These results support a model in which centriole amplification occurs during a transient state characterized by elevated Plk4 and Stil in early INP cells. These cells then go on to divide at least once to become OSNs, demonstrating that cell division with amplified centrioles, known to be tolerated in disease states, can occur as part of a normal developmental program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3ahmJn3nuIU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Network localization of alien limb in patients with corticobasal syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25901?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perirolandic atrophy occurs in corticobasal syndrome (CBS) but is not specific vs. progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). There is heterogeneity in the locations of atrophy outside perirolandic cortex and it remains unknown why atrophy in different locations would cause the same CBS‐specific symptoms. In prior work, we used a wiring diagram of the brain called the human connectome to localize lesion‐induced disorders to symptom‐specific brain networks. Here, we use a similar technique termed &lt;i&gt;atrophy network mapping&lt;/i&gt; to localize single‐subject atrophy maps to symptom‐specific brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐subject atrophy maps were generated by comparing cortical thickness in CBS patients vs. controls. Next, we performed seed‐based functional connectivity using a large normative connectome to determine brain regions functionally connected to each patient's atrophied locations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS patients had perirolandic atrophy vs. controls at the group level, but locations of atrophy in CBS were heterogeneous outside of perirolandic cortex at the single‐subject level (mean spatial correlation = 0.04). In contrast, atrophy occurred in locations functionally connected to the perirolandic cortex in all CBS patients (spatial correlation = 0.66). Compared with PSP, CBS patients had atrophy connected to a network of higher‐order sensorimotor regions beyond perirolandic cortex, matching a CBS atrophy network from a recent meta‐analysis. Finally, atrophy network mapping identified a symptom‐specific network for alien limb, matching a lesion‐induced alien limb network and a network associated with agency in normal subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a syndrome‐specific network for CBS and symptom‐specific network for alien limb using single‐subject atrophy maps and the human connectome.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>The small GTPase ARL4C participates in the regulation of cell migration, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and vesicular trafficking in epithelial cells. The ARL4C signaling cascade starts by the recruitment of the ARF–GEF cytohesins to the plasma membrane, which, in turn, bind and activate the small GTPase ARF6. However, the role of ARL4C–cytohesin–ARF6...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/FPG2J2w_Zwk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Humans have an extraordinary ability to interact and cooperate with others. Despite the social and evolutionary significance of collaboration, research on finding its neural correlates has been limited partly due to restrictions on the simultaneous neuroimaging of more than one participant (also known as hyperscanning).

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Polyethylene glycol‐fusion repair of sciatic allografts in female rats achieves immunotolerance via attenuated innate and adaptive responses&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/940c2c54-e6be-46f2-af00-c55c5270ea46/jnr24720-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate and adaptive immune responses to sciatic nerve allografts treated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐fusion repair protocol were compared to those in negative control allografts untreated by PEG. By 21 days PO, PEG‐fused allografts showed significantly reduced major histocompatibility complex class I expression and T cell (CD3) infiltration. PEG‐fused allografts more closely resembled unoperated nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ablation/segmental loss peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) exhibit poor functional recovery due to slow and inaccurate outgrowth of regenerating axons. Viable peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) as growth‐guide conduits are immunologically rejected and all anucleated donor/host axonal segments undergo Wallerian degeneration. In contrast, we report that ablation‐type sciatic PNIs repaired by neurorrhaphy of viable sciatic PNAs and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐fusion protocol using PEG immediately restored axonal continuity for many axons, reinnervated/maintained their neuromuscular junctions, and prevented much Wallerian degeneration. PEG‐fused PNAs permanently restored many sciatic‐mediated behaviors within 2–6 weeks. PEG‐fused PNAs were not rejected even though host/donors were neither immunosuppressed nor tissue‐matched in outbred female Sprague Dawley rats. Innate and adaptive immune responses to PEG‐fused sciatic PNAs were analyzed using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for morphological features, T cell and macrophage infiltration, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, apoptosis, expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic effectors. PEG‐fused PNAs exhibited attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses by 14–21 days postoperatively, as evidenced by (a) many axons and cells remaining viable, (b) significantly reduced infiltration of cytotoxic and total T cells and macrophages, (c) significantly reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and MHC proteins, (d) consistently low apoptotic response. Morphologically and/or biochemically, PEG‐fused sciatic PNAs often resembled sciatic &lt;i&gt;autografts&lt;/i&gt; or intact sciatic nerves. In brief, PEG‐fused PNAs are an unstudied, perhaps unique, example of immune tolerance of viable allograft tissue in a nonimmune‐privileged environment and could greatly improve the clinical outcomes for PNIs relative to current protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Disrupted brain functional networks in patients with end‐stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e6a83640-053d-455f-8d1f-3c5a8f9a0395/jnr24725-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using graph theory‐based approach, we investigated the topological organization of functional brain networks in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Disrupted brain functional networks were identified in patients with ESRD, and HD patients showed further disruptions in functional network organization compared with nondialysis patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterns of change in whole‐brain functional networks remain poorly understood in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We conducted a prospective research to investigate the topological properties of whole‐brain functional networks in those patients using a graph‐based network analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 51 ESRD patients (25 HD and 26 nondialysis patients) and 36 healthy controls (HCs). We compared the topological properties of brain functional networks among the three groups, and analyzed the relationships between those significant parameters and clinical variables in ESRD patients. Progressively disrupted global topological organizations were observed from nondialysis patients to HD patients compared with HCs (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). HD patients, relative to HCs, showed significantly decreased nodal centralities in the left temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus, bilateral median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral amygdala, and showed increased nodal centralities in the orbital part of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left cuneus, and left superior occipital gyrus (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Furthermore, nodal centralities in the bilateral hippocampus were significantly decreased in HD patients compared with nondialysis patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Dialysis duration negatively correlated with global efficiency in ESRD patients undergoing HD (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = −0.676, FDR &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). This study indicates that ESRD patients exhibit disruptions in brain functional networks, which are more severe in HD patients, and these alterations are correlated with cognitive performance and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental disorder that affects millions of people around the world. However, depressive symptoms can be seen in other psychiatric and medical conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of DHEA treatment on depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and/or other clinical conditions in which depressive symptoms are present. An electronic search was performed until October 2019, with no restrictions on language or year of publication in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DHEA versus placebo were included if the depressive symptoms were assessed. Fifteen studies with 853 female and male individuals were included in this review. To conduct the meta‐analysis, data were extracted from 14 studies. In comparison with placebo, DHEA improved depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.28, 95% (CI) −0.45 to −0.11, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; =.001, 12 studies, 742 individuals (375 in the experimental group and 367 in the placebo group), &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), very low quality of evidence, 2 of 14 studies reporting this outcome were removed in a sensitivity analysis as they were strongly influencing heterogeneity between studies. No hormonal changes that indicated any risk to the participants' health were seen. Side effects observed were uncommon, mild, and transient, but commonly related to androgyny. In conclusion, DHEA was associated with a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms compared to placebo. However, these results should be viewed with caution, since the quality of evidence for this outcome was considered very low according to the GRADE criteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Delirium case–no delirium control (n = 108) pairs were matched by age, sex, surgery type, cognition, and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers were measured in plasma collected preoperatively (PREOP), and 2 days (POD2) and 30 days postoperatively (PO1MO) using Simoa technology (Quanterix, Lexington, MA). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM‐S (Severity) were used to measure delirium and delirium severity, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with General Cognitive Performance (GCP) scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium cases had higher NfL on POD2 and PO1MO (median matched pair difference = 16.2pg/ml and 13.6pg/ml, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Patients with PREOP and POD2 NfL in the highest quartile (Q4) had increased risk for incident delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1–12.6] and 4.6 [95% CI = 1.2–18.2], respectively) and experienced more severe delirium, with sum CAM‐S scores 7.8 points (95% CI = 1.6–14.0) and 9.3 points higher (95% CI = 3.2–15.5). At PO1MO, delirium cases had continued high NfL (adjusted OR = 9.7, 95% CI = 2.3–41.4), and those with Q4 NfL values showed a −2.3 point decline in GCP score (−2.3 points, 95% CI = −4.7 to −0.9).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with the highest PREOP or POD2 NfL levels were more likely to develop delirium. Elevated NfL at PO1MO was associated with delirium and greater cognitive decline. These findings suggest NfL may be useful as a predictive biomarker for delirium risk and long‐term cognitive decline, and once confirmed would provide pathophysiological evidence for neuroaxonal injury following delirium.

&lt;p&gt;Graph illustrating the heterogeneity within the mesodiencephalic dopaminergic nuclei, in the proportion of cells immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that expressed the vesicular glutamatergic transporter 2 (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) during their lifetime according to a cell fate mapping strategy. Each dot illustrates the proportion measured from one mouse.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co‐transmission of glutamate by brain dopaminergic (DA) neurons was recently proposed as a potential factor influencing cell survival in models of Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, brain DA nuclei are differentially affected in Parkinson's disease. Whether this is associated with different patterns of co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype along the rostrocaudal brain axis is unknown in mammals. We hypothesized that, as in zebrafish, the glutamatergic phenotype is present preferentially in the caudal mesodiencephalic DA nuclei. Here, we used in mice a cell fate mapping strategy based on reporter protein expression (ZsGreen) consecutive to previous expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) gene, coupled with immunofluorescence experiments against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT). We found three expression patterns in DA cells, organized along the rostrocaudal brain axis. The first pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐positive, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A8–A10. The second pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A11. The third pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐negative) was found in A12–A13. These patterns should help to refine the establishment of the homology of DA nuclei between vertebrate species. Our results also uncover that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed at some point during cell lifetime in DA nuclei known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease and largely absent from those that are preserved, suggesting that co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype in DA cells influences their survival in Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Remodeling of projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5f452e44-09b5-44bb-9e57-d2ba4aa27959/cne25032-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon terminal branches, originating from the ventral hippocampus and distributed in the prefrontal cortex, undergo more frequent bifurcation but bear less numerous varicosities, which are putative synaptic sites, in Alzheimer's than wild‐type mice. This projection appears to be more widely spread, with scantier synapses, and therefore diluted in Alzheimer's mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional dysregulation often accompanies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus, most notably damaged by AD pathology, is classified into the cognition‐bound posterior and emotion‐bound anterior hippocampi. Since the anterior hippocampus or its rodent counterpart, the ventral hippocampus (VH), sends dense afferents to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the two structures implicated in fear responses, we investigated whether these afferents are modified in 3xTg AD model mice. An anterograde dextrin tracer injected into VH revealed that axons in PFC were more ramified in 3xTg than wild‐type (WT) mice, with the synaptic density reduced. The VH projections to BLA were not affected. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) or Aβ‐like immunoreactivity was found in PFC and BLA neurons alike. Behaviorally, in the 2‐way active avoidance test, the frequency of chamber change was higher, with the test performance better, in 3xTg than WT mice, suggesting a distorted contextual fear in the 3xTg group. Given the essential involvement of parts of PFC in contextual fear responses and that of BLA in fear responses in general, the observed remodeling of VH‐to‐PFC afferents and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ in BLA and PFC pyramidal cells might exercise critical influences on enhanced avoidance behavior in 3xTg mice.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameter optimisation is a crucial process in searching the optimal
machine learning model. The efficiency of finding the optimal hyperparameter
settings has been a big concern in recent researches since the optimisation
process could be time-consuming, especially when the objective functions are
highly expensive to evaluate. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent
evolutionary optimisation algorithm which applies machine learning technique to
the traditional evolutionary algorithm to accelerate the overall optimisation
process of tuning machine learning models in classification problems. We
demonstrate our Intelligent Evolutionary Optimisation (IEO)in a series of
controlled experiments, comparing with traditional evolutionary optimisation in
hyperparameter tuning. The empirical study shows that our approach accelerates
the optimisation speed by 30.40% on average and up to 77.06% in the best
scenarios.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many deep neural networks are built by using stacked convolutional layers of
fixed and single size (often 3$\times$3) kernels. This paper describes a method
for training the size of convolutional kernels to provide varying size kernels
in a single layer. The method utilizes a differentiable, and therefore
backpropagation-trainable Gaussian envelope which can grow or shrink in a base
grid. Our experiments compared the proposed adaptive layers to ordinary
convolution layers in a simple two-layer network, a deeper residual network,
and a U-Net architecture. The results in the popular image classification
datasets such as MNIST, MNIST-CLUTTERED, CIFAR-10, Fashion, and ``Faces in the
Wild'' showed that the adaptive kernels can provide statistically significant
improvements on ordinary convolution kernels. A segmentation experiment in the
Oxford-Pets dataset demonstrated that replacing a single ordinary convolution
layer in a U-shaped network with a single 7$\times$7 adaptive layer can improve
its learning performance and ability to generalize.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Differentiable neural computers extend artificial neural networks with an
explicit memory without interference, thus enabling the model to perform
classic computation tasks such as graph traversal. However, such models are
difficult to train, requiring long training times and large datasets. In this
work, we achieve some of the computational capabilities of differentiable
neural computers with a model that can be trained extremely efficiently, namely
an echo state network with an explicit memory without interference. This
extension raises the computation power of echo state networks from strictly
less than finite state machines to strictly more than finite state machines.
Further, we demonstrate experimentally that our model performs comparably to
its fully-trained deep version on several typical benchmark tasks for
differentiable neural computers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been observed that certain loss functions can render deep-learning
pipelines robust against flaws in the data. In this paper, we support these
empirical findings with statistical theory. We especially show that
empirical-risk minimization with unbounded, Lipschitz-continuous loss
functions, such as the least-absolute deviation loss, Huber loss, Cauchy loss,
and Tukey's biweight loss, can provide efficient prediction under minimal
assumptions on the data. More generally speaking, our paper provides
theoretical evidence for the benefits of robust loss functions in deep
learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art Neural Network Architectures (NNAs) are challenging to
design and implement efficiently in hardware. In the past couple of years, this
has led to an explosion in research and development of automatic Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) tools. AutomML tools are now used to achieve state of
the art NNA designs and attempt to optimize for hardware usage and design. Much
of the recent research in the auto-design of NNAs has focused on convolution
networks and image recognition, ignoring the fact that a significant part of
the workload in data centers is general-purpose deep neural networks. In this
work, we develop and test a general multilayer perceptron (MLP) flow that can
take arbitrary datasets as input and automatically produce optimized NNAs and
hardware designs. We test the flow on six benchmarks. Our results show we
exceed the performance of currently published MLP accuracy results and are
competitive with non-MLP based results. We compare general and common GPU
architectures with our scalable FPGA design and show we can achieve higher
efficiency and higher throughput (outputs per second) for the majority of
datasets. Further insights into the design space for both accurate networks and
high performing hardware shows the power of co-design by correlating accuracy
versus throughput, network size versus accuracy, and scaling to
high-performance devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits are characterized by exquisitely complex connectivity
patterns that emerge during development from undifferentiated networks. The
development of these circuits is governed by a combination of precise molecular
cues that dictate neuronal identity and location along with activity dependent
mechanisms that help establish, refine, and maintain neuronal connectivity.
Here we ask whether simple plasticity mechanisms can lead to assembling a
cortical microcircuit with canonical inter-laminar connectivity, starting from
a network with all-to-all connectivity. The target canonical microcircuit is
based on the pattern of connections between cortical layers typically found in
multiple cortical areas in rodents, cats and monkeys. We use a computational
model as a proof-of-principle to demonstrate that classical and reverse
spike-timing dependent plasticity rules lead to a formation of networks that
resemble canonical microcircuits. The model converges to biologically
reasonable solutions provided that there is a balance between potentiation and
depression and enhanced inputs to layer 4, only for a small combination of
plasticity rules. The model makes specific testable predictions about the
learning computations operant across cortical layers and their dynamic
deployment during development.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning ensembles by bagging can substantially improve the generalization
performance of low-bias high-variance estimators, including those evolved by
Genetic Programming (GP). Yet, the best way to learn ensembles in GP remains to
be determined. This work attempts to fill the gap between existing GP ensemble
learning algorithms, which are often either simple but expensive, or efficient
but complex. We propose a new algorithm that is both simple and efficient,
named Simple Simultaneous Ensemble Genetic Programming (2SEGP). 2SEGP is
obtained by relatively minor modifications to fitness evaluation and selection
of a classic GP algorithm, and its only drawback is an (arguably small)
increase of the fitness evaluation cost from the classic $\mathcal{O}(n \ell)$
to $\mathcal{O}(n(\ell + \beta))$, with $n$ the number of observations and
$\ell$/$\beta$ the estimator/ensemble size. Experimental comparisons on
real-world datasets between supervised classification and regression show that,
despite its simplicity, 2SEGP fares very well against state-of-the-art
(ensemble and not) GP algorithms. We further provide insights into what matters
in 2SEGP by (i) scaling $\beta$, (ii) ablating the proposed selection method,
(iii) observing the evolvability induced by traditional subtree variation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Constrained Optimization solution algorithms are restricted to point based
solutions. In practice, single or multiple objectives must be satisfied,
wherein both the objective function and constraints can be non-convex resulting
in multiple optimal solutions. Real world scenarios include intersecting
surfaces as Implicit Functions, Hyperspectral Unmixing and Pareto Optimal
fronts. Local or global convexification is a common workaround when faced with
non-convex forms. However, such an approach is often restricted to a strict
class of functions, deviation from which results in sub-optimal solution to the
original problem. We present neural solutions for extracting optimal sets as
approximate manifolds, where unmodified, non-convex objectives and constraints
are defined as modeler guided, domain-informed $L_2$ loss function. This
promotes interpretability since modelers can confirm the results against known
analytical forms in their specific domains. We present synthetic and realistic
cases to validate our approach and compare against known solvers for
bench-marking in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the unprecedented demand for location-based services in indoor
scenarios, wireless indoor localization has become essential for mobile users.
While GPS is not available at indoor spaces, WiFi RSS fingerprinting has become
popular with its ubiquitous accessibility. However, it is challenging to
achieve robust and efficient indoor localization with two major challenges.
First, the localization accuracy can be degraded by the random signal
fluctuations, which would influence conventional localization algorithms that
simply learn handcrafted features from raw fingerprint data. Second, mobile
users are sensitive to the localization delay, but conventional indoor
localization algorithms are computation-intensive and time-consuming. In this
paper, we propose EdgeLoc, an edge-IoT framework for efficient and robust
indoor localization using capsule networks. We develop a deep learning model
with the CapsNet to efficiently extract hierarchical information from WiFi
fingerprint data, thereby significantly improving the localization accuracy.
Moreover, we implement an edge-computing prototype system to achieve a nearly
real-time localization process, by enabling mobile users with the deep-learning
model that has been well-trained by the edge server. We conduct a real-world
field experimental study with over 33,600 data points and an extensive
synthetic experiment with the open dataset, and the experimental results
validate the effectiveness of EdgeLoc. The best trade-off of the EdgeLoc system
achieves 98.5% localization accuracy within an average positioning time of only
2.31 ms in the field experiment.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagation algorithms on recurrent artificial neural networks require an
unfolding of accumulated states over time. These states must be kept in memory
for an undefined period of time which is task-dependent. This paper uses the
reservoir computing paradigm where an untrained recurrent neural network layer
is used as a preprocessor stage to learn temporal and limited data. These
so-called reservoirs require either extensive fine-tuning or neuroplasticity
with unsupervised learning rules. We propose a new local plasticity rule named
P-CRITICAL designed for automatic reservoir tuning that translates well to
Intel's Loihi research chip, a recent neuromorphic processor. We compare our
approach on well-known datasets from the machine learning community while using
a spiking neuronal architecture. We observe an improved performance on tasks
coming from various modalities without the need to tune parameters. Such
algorithms could be a key to end-to-end energy-efficient neuromorphic-based
machine learning on edge devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In deep learning, it is usually assumed that the shape of the loss surface is
fixed. Differently, a novel concept of deformation operator is first proposed
in this paper to deform the loss surface, thereby improving the optimization.
Deformation function, as a type of deformation operator, can improve the
generalization performance. Moreover, various deformation functions are
designed, and their contributions to the loss surface are further provided.
Then, the original stochastic gradient descent optimizer is theoretically
proved to be a flat minima filter that owns the talent to filter out the sharp
minima. Furthermore, the flatter minima could be obtained by exploiting the
proposed deformation functions, which is verified on CIFAR-100, with
visualizations of loss landscapes near the critical points obtained by both the
original optimizer and optimizer enhanced by deformation functions. The
experimental results show that deformation functions do find flatter regions.
Moreover, on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, popular convolutional neural
networks enhanced by deformation functions are compared with the corresponding
original models, where significant improvements are observed on all of the
involved models equipped with deformation functions. For example, the top-1
test accuracy of ResNet-20 on CIFAR-100 increases by 1.46%, with insignificant
additional computational overhead.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models.
Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities,
we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via
nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems
with varying (i.e., \emph{liquid}) time-constants coupled to their hidden
state, with outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers.
These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior
expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and
give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To
demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find
bounds over their dynamics, and compute their expressive power by the
\emph{trajectory length} measure in a latent trajectory space. We then conduct
a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation
capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to modern RNNs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel modular object detection convolutional neural network that
significantly improves the accuracy of object detection. The network consists
of two stages in a hierarchical structure. The first stage is a network that
detects general classes. The second stage consists of separate networks to
refine the classification and localization of each of the general classes
objects. Compared to a state of the art object detection networks the
classification error in the modular network is improved by approximately 3-5
times, from 12% to 2.5 %-4.5%. This network is easy to implement and has a 0.94
mAP. The network architecture can be a platform to improve the accuracy of
widespread state of the art object detection networks and other kinds of deep
learning networks. We show that a deep learning network initialized by transfer
learning becomes more accurate as the number of classes it later trained to
detect becomes smaller.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures are
primarily driven by human expertise and by elaborate design processes.
Recently, neural architecture search was proposed with the aim of automating
the network design process and generating task-dependent architectures. While
existing approaches have achieved competitive performance in image
classification, they are not well suited to problems where the computational
budget is limited for two reasons: (1) the obtained architectures are either
solely optimized for classification performance, or only for one deployment
scenario; (2) the search process requires vast computational resources in most
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we propose an evolutionary algorithm
for searching neural architectures under multiple objectives, such as
classification performance and floating-point operations (FLOPs). The proposed
method addresses the first shortcoming by populating a set of architectures to
approximate the entire Pareto frontier through genetic operations that
recombine and modify architectural components progressively. Our approach
improves computational efficiency by carefully down-scaling the architectures
during the search as well as reinforcing the patterns commonly shared among
past successful architectures through Bayesian model learning. The integration
of these two main contributions allows an efficient design of architectures
that are competitive and in most cases outperform both manually and
automatically designed architectures on benchmark image classification
datasets: CIFAR, ImageNet, and human chest X-ray. The flexibility provided from
simultaneously obtaining multiple architecture choices for different compute
requirements further differentiates our approach from other methods in the
literature. Code is available at https://github.com/mikelzc1990/nsganetv1

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Built to Last: Functional and structural mechanisms in the moth olfactory network mitigate effects of neural injury. (arXiv:1808.01279v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01279</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most organisms suffer neuronal damage throughout their lives, which can
impair performance of core behaviors. Their neural circuits need to maintain
function despite injury, which in particular requires preserving key system
outputs. In this work, we explore whether and how certain structural and
functional neuronal network motifs act as injury mitigation mechanisms.
Specifically, we examine how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise,
and (iii) parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to the
robustness of the olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth. We simulate
injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory network
calibrated to in vivo data. The injuries are modeled on focal axonal swellings,
a ubiquitous form of axonal pathology observed in traumatic brain injuries and
other brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon, reducing the effective neural firing rate delivered
to downstream neurons. All three of the network motifs examined significantly
mitigate the effects of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's
impact on readout neuron responses or by restoring these responses to
pre-injury levels. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their value
as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural injury.
More generally, robustness to injury is a vital design principle to consider
when analyzing neural systems.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mechanism of Zinc Excitotoxicity: A Focus on AMPK</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577958</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577958</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 20 years, it has been shown that complex signaling cascades are involved in zinc excitotoxicity. Free zinc rapidly induces PKC activation, which causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at least in part through NADPH oxidase. It also promotes neuronal nitric oxide synthase, thereby increasing nitric oxide (NO) production. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and Egr-1 transcription factor activity were quickly induced by zinc, too. These concurrent actions of kinases consequently produce oxygen free radical, ROS, and NO, which may cause severe DNA damage. Following the excessive activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 depletes NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/ATP in the cells. Zinc excitotoxicity exhibits distinct characteristics of apoptosis, too. Activation of caspase-3 is induced by liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-Bim cascade signaling and induction of p75NTR receptors and p75NTR-associated Death Executor. Thus, zinc excitotoxicity is a mechanism of neuronal cell death showing various cell death patterns. In addition to the above signaling cascades, individual intracellular organelles also play a crucial role in zinc excitotoxicity. Mitochondria and lysosomes function as zinc reservoirs, and as such, are capable of regulating zinc concentration in the cytoplasm. However, when loaded with too much zinc, they may undergo mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), both of which are well-established mechanisms of cell death. Since zinc excitotoxicity has been reported to be associated with acute brain injuries, including stroke, trauma, and epilepsy, we performed to find the novel AMPK inhibitors as therapeutic agents for these diseases. Since we thought acute brain injury has complicated neuronal death pathways, we tried to see the neuroprotection against zinc excitotoxicity, calcium-overload excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. We found that two chemicals showed significant neuroprotection against all cellular neurotoxic models we tested. Finally, we observed the reduction of infarct volume in a rat model of brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this review, we introduced the AMPK-mediated cell death mechanism and novel strategy for the development of stroke therapeutics. The hope is that this understanding would provide a rationale for acute brain injury and eventually find new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Manganese (Mn), an essential micronutrient, acts as a cofactor for multiple enzymes. Epidemiological investigations have shown that an excessive level of Mn is an important environmental factor involved in neurotoxicity. Frequent pollution of air and water by Mn is a serious threat to the health of the population. Overexposure to Mn is particularly detrimental to the central nervous system, leading to symptoms similar to several neurological disorders. Many different mechanisms have been implicated in Mn-induced neurotoxicity, including oxidative/nitrosative stress, toxic protein aggregation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of autophagy, and the apoptotic cascade, which together promote the progressive neurodegeneration of nerve cells. As a compensatory regulatory mechanism, autophagy plays dual roles in various biological activities under pathological stress conditions. Dysregulation of autophagy is involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, with recent emerging evidence indicating a strong, complex relationship between autophagy and Mn-induced neurotoxicity. This review discusses the connection between autophagy and Mn-induced neurotoxicity, especially alpha-synuclein oligomerization, ER stress, and aberrated protein S-nitrosylation, which will provide new insights to profoundly explore the precise mechanisms of Mn-induced neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cold Exposure After Exercise Impedes the Neuroprotective Effects of Exercise on Thermoregulation and UCP4 Expression in an MPTP-Induced Parkinsonian Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderate exercise and mild hypothermia have protective effects against brain injury and neurodegeneration. Running in a cold environment alters exercise-induced hyperthermia and outcomes; however, evaluations of post-exercise cold exposure related to exercise benefits for the brain are relatively rare. We investigated the effects of 4°C cold exposure after exercise on exercise-induced thermal responses and neuroprotection in an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced Parkinsonian mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with MPTP for five consecutive days and follow-up treadmill exercise for 4 weeks. After 1-h running at a 22°C temperature, the mice were exposed to a 4°C environment for 2 h. An MPTP injection induced a transient drop in body and brain temperatures, while mild brain hypothermia was found to last for 4 weeks after MPTP treatment. Preventing brain hypothermia by exercise or 4°C exposure was associated with an improvement in MPTP-induced striatal uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4) downregulation and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, 4°C exposure after exercise abrogated the exercise-induced beneficial effects and thermal responses in MPTP-treated mice, including a low amplitude of exercise-induced brain hyperthermia and body temperature while at rest after exercise. Our findings elucidate that post-exercise thermoregulation and UCP4 expression are important in the neuroprotective effects of exercise against MPTP toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To investigate the baseline values and differences for susceptibility and volume of the mammillary bodies between mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients and healthy controls (HCs), and further explore their differences in relation to gender, MCI subtypes and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T1-weighted and multi-echo gradient echo imaging sequences were acquired on a 3T MR scanner to evaluate the T1W based volume and susceptibility differences in the mammillary body for 47 MCI and 47 HCs. T-tests were performed to compare volume and susceptibility between groups, and right and left hemispheres. Correlation analysis was used to relate the volume and mean susceptibility as a function of age in MCI and HC groups separately, and to investigate the relationship of susceptibility with the neuro-psychological scales in the MCI group.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Susceptibility was found to be elevated within the right mammillary body in MCI patients compared to HCs (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were no differences for the mammillary body volumes between the MCI and HC groups, although there was a reduction in volume with age for the MCI group (p = 0.007). Women showed decreased mammillary body volume compared to men in the HC group (p = 0.004). No significant differences were found in relation to MCI subtypes and APOE genotypes. No significant correlations were observed between mammillary body susceptibility with neuro-psychological scales.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This work provides a quantitative baseline for both the volume and susceptibility of the mammillary body which can be used for future studies of cognitive impairment patients underlying the pathology of the Papez circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroanatomical and Microglial Alterations in the Striatum of Levodopa-Treated, Dyskinetic Hemi-Parkinsonian Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dyskinesia associated with chronic levodopa treatment in Parkinson’s disease is associated with maladaptive striatal plasticity. The objective of this study was to examine whether macroscale structural changes, as captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accompany this plasticity and to identify plausible cellular contributors in a rodent model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered hemi-parkinsonian by stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the left medial forebrain bundle prior to chronic treatment with saline (control) or levodopa to induce abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), reflective of dyskinesia. Perfusion-fixed brains underwent ex vivo structural MRI before sectioning and staining for cellular markers. Chronic treatment with levodopa induced significant AIMs (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 versus saline). The absolute volume of the ipsilateral, lesioned striatum was increased in levodopa-treated rats resulting in a significant difference in percentage volume change when compared to saline-treated rats (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between this volume change and AIMs scores for individual levodopa-treated rats (r = 0.96; p &amp;lt; 0.01). The density of Iba1+ cells was increased within the lesioned versus intact striatum (p &amp;lt; 0.01) with no difference between treatment groups. Conversely, Iba1+ microglia soma size was significantly increased (p &amp;lt; 0.01) in the lesioned striatum of levodopa-treated but not saline-treated rats. Soma size was not, however, significantly correlated with either AIMs or MRI volume change. Although GFAP+ astrocytes were elevated in the lesioned versus intact striatum (p &amp;lt; 0.001), there was no difference between treatment groups. No statistically significant effects of either lesion or treatment on RECA1, a marker for blood vessels, were observed. Collectively, these data suggest chronic levodopa treatment in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats is associated with increased striatal volume that correlates with the development of AIMs. The accompanying increase in number and size of microglia, however, cannot alone explain this volume expansion. Further multi-modal studies are warranted to establish the brain-wide effects of chronic levodopa treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Derangements in brain glutamate, glutathione, and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) are implicated in a range of neurological disorders. Reliable methods to measure these compounds non-invasively in vivo are needed. We evaluated the reproducibility of their measurements in brain regions involved in the default mode network using quantitative MRS at 7-Tesla in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Ten right-handed healthy volunteers underwent 7-Tesla MRI scans on 2 separate days, not more than 2 weeks apart. On each day two scanning sessions took place, with a re-positioning break in between. High-resolution isotropic anatomical scans were acquired prior to each scan, followed by single-voxel &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS using the STEAM pulse sequence on an 8 mL midline cubic voxel, positioned over the posterior cingulate and precuneus regions. Concentrations were corrected for partial-volume effects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Maximal Cramér-Rao lower bounds for glutamate, glutathione, and GABA were 2.0, 8.0, and 14.0%, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation within sessions were 5.9 ± 4.8%, 9.3 ± 7.6%, and 11.5 ± 8.8%, and between sessions were 4.6 ± 4.5%, 8.3 ± 5.7%, and 9.2 ± 8.7%, respectively. The mean (±SD) Dice’s coefficient for voxel overlap was 90 ± 4% within sessions and 86 ± 7% between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Glutamate, glutathione, and GABA can be reliably quantified using STEAM MRS at 7-Tesla from the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices of healthy human subjects. STEAM MRS at 7-Tesla may be used to study the metabolic behavior of this important resting-state hub in various disease states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Electrophysiological and Neuroimaging Studies – During Resting State and Sensory Stimulation in Disorders of Consciousness: A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.555093</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A severe brain injury may lead to a disorder of consciousness (DOC) such as coma, vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state (MCS) or locked-in syndrome (LIS). Till date, the diagnosis of DOC relies only on clinical evaluation or subjective scoring systems such as Glasgow coma scale, which fails to detect subtle changes and thereby results in diagnostic errors. The high rate of misdiagnosis and inability to predict the recovery of consciousness for DOC patients have created a huge research interest in the assessment of consciousness. Researchers have explored the use of various stimulation and neuroimaging techniques to improve the diagnosis. In this article, we present the important findings of resting-state as well as sensory stimulation methods and highlight the stimuli proven to be successful in the assessment of consciousness. Primarily, we review the literature based on (a) application/non-use of stimuli (i.e., sensory stimulation/resting state-based), (b) type of stimulation used (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, or mental-imagery), (c) electrophysiological signal used (EEG/ERP, fMRI, PET, EMG, SCL, or ECG). Among the sensory stimulation methods, auditory stimulation has been extensively used, since it is easier to conduct for these patients. Olfactory and tactile stimulation have been less explored and need further research. Emotionally charged stimuli such as subject’s own name or narratives in a familiar voice or subject’s own face/family pictures or music result in stronger responses than neutral stimuli. Studies based on resting state analysis have employed measures like complexity, power spectral features, entropy and functional connectivity patterns to distinguish between the VS and MCS patients. Resting-state EEG and fMRI are the state-of-the-art techniques and have a huge potential in predicting the recovery of coma patients. Further, EMG and mental-imagery based studies attempt to obtain volitional responses from the VS patients and thus could detect their command-following capability. This may provide an effective means to communicate with these patients. Recent studies have employed fMRI and PET to understand the brain-activation patterns corresponding to the mental imagery. This review promotes our knowledge about the techniques used for the diagnosis of patients with DOC and attempts to provide ideas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Relationship Between Basic Properties of BOLD Fluctuations and Calculated Metrics of Complexity in the Human Connectome Project</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) creates a rich four-dimensional data set that can be analyzed in a variety of ways. As more researchers come to view the brain as a complex dynamical system, tools are increasingly being drawn from other fields to characterize the complexity of the brain’s activity. However, given that the signal measured with rs-fMRI arises from the hemodynamic response to neural activity, the extent to which complexity metrics reflect neural complexity as compared to signal properties related to image quality remains unknown. To provide some insight into this question, correlation dimension, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent were calculated for different rs-fMRI scans from the same subject to examine their reliability. The metrics of complexity were then compared to several properties of the rs-fMRI signal from each brain area to determine if basic signal features could explain differences in the complexity metrics. Differences in complexity across brain areas were highly reliable and were closely linked to differences in the frequency profiles of the rs-fMRI signal. The spatial distributions of the complexity and frequency metrics suggest that they are both influenced by location-dependent signal properties that can obscure changes related to neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Pyneal: Open Source Real-Time fMRI Software</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, neuroimaging researchers are exploring the use of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) as a way to access a participant’s ongoing brain function throughout a scan. This approach presents novel and exciting experimental applications ranging from monitoring data quality in real time, to delivering neurofeedback from a region of interest, to dynamically controlling experimental flow, or interfacing with remote devices. Yet, for those interested in adopting this method, the existing software options are few and limited in application. This presents a barrier for new users, as well as hinders existing users from refining techniques and methods. Here we introduce a free, open-source rt-fMRI package, the Pyneal toolkit, designed to address this limitation. The Pyneal toolkit is python-based software that offers a flexible and user friendly framework for rt-fMRI, is compatible with all three major scanner manufacturers (GE, Siemens, Phillips), and, critically, allows fully customized analysis pipelines. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of the architecture, describe how to set up and run the Pyneal toolkit during an experimental session, offer tutorials with scan data that demonstrate how data flows through the Pyneal toolkit with example analyses, and highlight the advantages that the Pyneal toolkit offers to the neuroimaging community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Do Musicians Have Better Mnemonic and Executive Performance Than Actors? Influence of Regular Musical or Theater Practice in Adults and in the Elderly</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.557642</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.557642</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The effects of musical practice on cognition are well established yet rarely compared with other kinds of artistic training or expertise. This study aims to compare the possible effect of musical and theater regular practice on cognition across the lifespan. Both of these artistic activities require many hours of individual or collective training in order to reach an advanced level. This process requires the interaction between higher-order cognitive functions and several sensory modalities (auditory, verbal, visual and motor), as well as regular learning of new pieces. This study included participants with musical or theater practice, and healthy controls matched for age (18–84 years old) and education. The objective was to determine whether specific practice in these activities had an effect on cognition across the lifespan, and a protective influence against undesirable cognitive outcomes associated with aging. All participants underwent a battery of cognitive tasks that evaluated processing speed, executive function, fluency, working memory, verbal and visual long-term memories, and non-verbal reasoning abilities. Results showed that music and theater artistic practices were strongly associated with cognitive enhancements. Participants with musical practice were better in executive functioning, working memory and non-verbal reasoning, whereas participants with regular acting practice had better long-term verbal memory and fluency performance. Thus, taken together, results suggest a differential effect of these artistic practices on cognition across the lifespan. Advanced age did not seem to reduce the benefit, so future studies should focus on the hypothetical protective effects of artistic practice against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Simplified CNN Classification Method for MI-EEG via the Electrode Pairs Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00338</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can provide independent information exchange and control channels for the brain and the outside world. However, EEG signals come from multiple electrodes, the data of which can generate multiple features. How to select electrodes and features to improve classification performance has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with separated temporal and spatial filters, which selects the raw EEG signals of the electrode pairs over the motor cortex region as hybrid samples without any preprocessing or artificial feature extraction operations. In the proposed structure, a 5-layer CNN has been applied to learn EEG features, a 4-layer max pooling has been used to reduce dimensionality, and a fully-connected (FC) layer has been utilized for classification. Dropout and batch normalization are also employed to reduce the risk of overfitting. In the experiment, the 4 s EEG data of 10, 20, 60, and 100 subjects from the Physionet database are used as the data source, and the motor imaginations (MI) tasks are divided into four types: left fist, right fist, both fists, and both feet. The results indicate that the global averaged accuracy on group-level classification can reach 97.28%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve stands out at 0.997, and the electrode pair with the highest accuracy on 10 subjects dataset is FC3-FC4, with 98.61%. The research results also show that this CNN classification method with minimal (2) electrode can obtain high accuracy, which is an advantage over other methods on the same database. This proposed approach provides a new idea for simplifying the design of BCI systems, and accelerates the process of clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Oscillatory Bursting as a Mechanism for Temporal Coupling and Information Coding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Even the simplest cognitive processes involve interactions between cortical regions. To study these processes, we usually rely on averaging across several repetitions of a task or across long segments of data to reach a statistically valid conclusion. Neuronal oscillations reflect synchronized excitability fluctuations in ensembles of neurons and can be observed in electrophysiological recordings in the presence or absence of an external stimulus. Oscillatory brain activity has been viewed as sustained increase in power at specific frequency bands. However, this perspective has been challenged in recent years by the notion that oscillations may occur as transient burst-like events that occur in individual trials and may only appear as sustained activity when multiple trials are averaged together. In this review, we examine the idea that oscillatory activity can manifest as a transient burst as well as a sustained increase in power. We discuss the technical challenges involved in the detection and characterization of transient events at the single trial level, the mechanisms that might generate them and the features that can be extracted from these events to study single-trial dynamics of neuronal ensemble activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of Caenorhabditis elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackelberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes in Metabolism and Proteostasis Drive Aging Phenotype in Aplysia californica Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with cognitive declines that originate in impairments of function in the neurons that make up the nervous system. The marine mollusk Aplysia californica (Aplysia) is a premier model for the nervous system uniquely suited to investigation of neuronal aging due to uniquely identifiable neurons and molecular techniques available in this model. This study describes the molecular processes associated with aging in two populations of sensory neurons in Aplysia by applying RNA sequencing technology across the aging process (age 6–12 months). Differentially expressed genes clustered into four to five coherent expression patterns across the aging time series in the two neuron populations. Enrichment analysis of functional annotations in these neuron clusters revealed decreased expression of pathways involved in energy metabolism and neuronal signaling, suggesting that metabolic and signaling pathways are intertwined. Furthermore, increased expression of pathways involved in protein processing and translation suggests that proteostatic stress also occurs in aging. Temporal overlap of enrichment for energy metabolism, proteostasis, and neuronal function suggests that cognitive impairments observed in advanced age result from the ramifications of broad declines in energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Obesity and diabetes as comorbidities for COVID-19: Underlying mechanisms and the role of viral–bacterial interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61330</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61330</link>
	<description>Obesity and diabetes are established comorbidities for COVID-19. Adipose tissue demonstrates high expression of ACE2 which SARS- CoV-2 exploits to enter host cells. This makes adipose tissue a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and thus increases the integral viral load. Acute viral infection results in ACE2 downregulation. This relative deficiency can lead to disturbances in other systems controlled by ACE2, including the renin-angiotensin system. This will be further increased in the case of pre-conditions with already compromised functioning of these systems, such as in patients with obesity and diabetes. Here, we propose that interactions of virally-induced ACE2 deficiency with obesity and/or diabetes leads to a synergistic further impairment of endothelial and gut barrier function. The appearance of bacteria and/or their products in the lungs of obese and diabetic patients promotes interactions between viral and bacterial pathogens, resulting in a more severe lung injury in COVID-19.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mutational resilience of antiviral restriction favors primate TRIM5α in host-virus evolutionary arms races</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59988</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59988</link>
	<description>Host antiviral proteins engage in evolutionary arms races with viruses, in which both sides rapidly evolve at interaction interfaces to gain or evade immune defense. For example, primate TRIM5α uses its rapidly evolving ‘v1’ loop to bind retroviral capsids, and single mutations in this loop can dramatically improve retroviral restriction. However, it is unknown whether such gains of viral restriction are rare, or if they incur loss of pre-existing function against other viruses. Using deep mutational scanning, we comprehensively measured how single mutations in the TRIM5α v1 loop affect restriction of divergent retroviruses. Unexpectedly, we found that the majority of mutations increase weak antiviral function. Moreover, most random mutations do not disrupt potent viral restriction, even when it is newly acquired via a single adaptive substitution. Our results indicate that TRIM5α’s adaptive landscape is remarkably broad and mutationally resilient, maximizing its chances of success in evolutionary arms races with retroviruses.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59726</link>
	<description>Phenazines are natural bacterial antibiotics that can protect crops from disease. However, for most crops it is unknown which producers and specific phenazines are ecologically relevant, and whether phenazine biodegradation can counter their effects. To better understand their ecology, we developed and environmentally-validated a quantitative metagenomic approach to mine for phenazine biosynthesis and biodegradation genes, applying it to &amp;gt;800 soil and plant-associated shotgun-metagenomes. We discover novel producer-crop associations and demonstrate that phenazine biosynthesis is prevalent across habitats and preferentially enriched in rhizospheres, whereas biodegrading bacteria are rare. We validate an association between maize and &lt;i&gt;Dyella japonica&lt;/i&gt;, a putative producer abundant in crop microbiomes. &lt;i&gt;D. japonica&lt;/i&gt; upregulates phenazine biosynthesis during phosphate limitation and robustly colonizes maize seedling roots. This work provides a global picture of phenazines in natural environments and highlights plant-microbe associations of agricultural potential. Our metagenomic approach may be extended to other metabolites and functional traits in diverse ecosystems.</description>

	<title>eLife: Transport of DNA within cohesin involves clamping on top of engaged heads by Scc2 and entrapment within the ring by Scc3</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59560</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59560</link>
	<description>In addition to extruding DNA loops, cohesin entraps within its SMC-kleisin ring (S-K) individual DNAs during G1 and sister DNAs during S-phase. All three activities require related hook-shaped proteins called Scc2 and Scc3. Using thiol-specific crosslinking we provide rigorous proof of entrapment activity in vitro. Scc2 alone promotes entrapment of DNAs in the E-S and E-K compartments, between ATP-bound engaged heads and the SMC hinge and associated kleisin, respectively. This does not require ATP hydrolysis nor is it accompanied by entrapment within S-K rings, which is a slower process requiring Scc3. Cryo-EM reveals that DNAs transported into E-S/E-K compartments are ‘clamped’ in a sub-compartment created by Scc2’s association with engaged heads whose coiled coils are folded around their elbow. We suggest that clamping may be a recurrent feature of cohesin complexes active in loop extrusion and that this conformation precedes the S-K entrapment required for sister chromatid cohesion.</description>

	<title>eLife: SWELL1 regulates skeletal muscle cell size, intracellular signalling, adiposity and glucose metabolism</title>

	<description>Maintenance of skeletal muscle is beneficial in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Mechanical stimulation can regulate skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and metabolism, however the molecular mechanosensor remains unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;rrc8a&lt;/i&gt;) functionally encodes a swell-activated anion channel that regulates PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, mTOR signaling, muscle differentiation, myoblast fusion, cellular oxygen consumption, and glycolysis in skeletal muscle cells. LRRC8A over-expression in &lt;i&gt;Lrrc8a &lt;/i&gt;KO myotubes boosts PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling to supra-normal levels and fully rescues myotube formation. Skeletal muscle targeted &lt;i&gt;Lrrc8a &lt;/i&gt;KO mice have smaller myofibers, generate less force &lt;i&gt;ex vivo, &lt;/i&gt;and exhibit reduced exercise endurance, associated with increased adiposity under basal conditions, and glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when raised on a high-fat diet, compared to WT mice. These results reveal that the LRRC8 complex regulates insulin-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling in skeletal muscle to influence skeletal muscle differentiation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and skeletal myofiber size, muscle function, adiposity and systemic metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector–pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cx. quinquefascsiatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cx. tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23–26°C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24°C, matching model-predicted optima (24–25°C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Meta Research: Questionable research practices may have little effect on replicability</title>

	<description>This article examines why many studies fail to replicate statistically significant published results. We address this issue within a general statistical framework that also allows us to include various questionable research practices (QRPs) that are thought to reduce replicability. The analyses indicate that the base rate of true effects is the major factor that determines the replication rate of scientific results. Specifically, for purely statistical reasons, replicability is low in research domains where true effects are rare (e.g., search for effective drugs in pharmacology). This point is under-appreciated in current scientific and media discussions of replicability, which often attribute poor replicability mainly to QRPs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Erasable labeling of neuronal activity using a reversible calcium marker</title>

	<description>Understanding how the brain encodes and processes information requires the recording of neural activity that underlies different behaviors. Recent efforts in fluorescent protein engineering have succeeded in developing powerful tools for visualizing neural activity, in general by coupling neural activity to different properties of a fluorescent protein scaffold. Here, we take advantage of a previously unexploited class of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins to engineer a new type of calcium sensor. We introduce rsCaMPARI, a genetically encoded calcium marker engineered from a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein that enables spatiotemporally precise marking, erasing, and remarking of active neuron populations under brief, user-defined time windows of light exposure. rsCaMPARI photoswitching kinetics are modulated by calcium concentration when illuminating with blue light, and the fluorescence can be reset with violet light. We demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking and remarking active neuron populations in freely swimming zebrafish.</description>

	<description>Deep learning in in-vitro fertilization is currently being evaluated in the development of assistive tools for the determination of transfer order and implantation potential using time-lapse data collected through expensive imaging hardware. Assistive tools and algorithms that can work with static images, however, can help in improving the access to care by enabling their use with images acquired from traditional microscopes that are available to virtually all fertility centers. Here, we evaluated the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), trained using single timepoint images of embryos collected at 113 hours post-insemination, in embryo selection amongst 97 clinical patient cohorts (742 embryos) and observed an accuracy of 90% in choosing the highest quality embryo available. Furthermore, a CNN trained to assess an embryo’s implantation potential directly using a set of 97 euploid embryos capable of implantation outperformed 15 trained embryologists (75.26% vs. 67.35%, P&amp;lt;0.0001) from 5 different fertility centers.</description>

	<title>eLife: Efficient sampling and noisy decisions</title>

	<description>Human decisions are based on finite information, which makes them inherently imprecise. But what determines the degree of such imprecision? Here, we develop an efficient coding framework for higher-level cognitive processes in which information is represented by a finite number of discrete samples. We characterize the sampling process that maximizes perceptual accuracy or fitness under the often-adopted assumption that full adaptation to an environmental distribution is possible, and show how the optimal process differs when detailed information about the current contextual distribution is costly. We tested this theory on a numerosity discrimination task, and found that humans efficiently adapt to contextual distributions, but in the way predicted by the model in which people must economize on environmental information. Thus, understanding decision behavior requires that we account for biological restrictions on information coding, challenging the often-adopted assumption of precise prior knowledge in higher-level decision systems.</description>

	<description>Though computational models predict how sensory inputs converge in central neurons, it is technically challenging to test these ideas experimentally. With whole-cell recordings in larval zebrafish in vivo, Liu et al. demonstrate that the convergence of similarly or differently tuned vestibular afferents produces more simple or complex postsynaptic tuning, respectively.</description>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31143-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Here, we find that translation attenuation following eIF2α phosphorylation is not uniform, with long-lived proteins, including cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, being prominently downregulated. Because protein stability buffers the cost of translational attenuation, there is no measurable decrease of the targeted proteins. This reveals an evolutionary principle of cellular robustness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Behavioral evidence for nested central pattern generator control of Drosophila grooming</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.298679v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Central pattern generators (CPGs) are neurons or neural circuits that produce periodic output without requiring patterned input. More complex behaviors can be assembled from simpler subroutines, and nested CPGs have been proposed to coordinate their repetitive elements, simplifying control over different time-scales. Here, we use behavioral experiments to establish that Drosophila grooming may be controlled by nested CPGs. On the short time-scale (5-7 Hz), flies execute periodic leg sweeps and rubs. More surprisingly, transitions between bouts of head cleaning and leg rubbing are also periodic on a longer time-scale (0.3 - 0.6 Hz). We examine grooming at a range of temperatures to show that the frequencies of both oscillations increase - a hallmark of CPG control - and also that the two time-scales increase at the same rate, indicating that the nested CPGs may be linked. This relationship also holds when sensory drive is held constant using optogenetic activation, but the rhythms decouple in spontaneously grooming flies, showing that alternative control modes are possible. Nested CPGs simplify generation of complex but repetitive behaviors, and identifying them in Drosophila grooming presents an opportunity to map the neural circuits that constitute them.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Targeting ischemia-induced KCC2 hypofunction rescues refractory neonatal seizures and mitigates epileptogenesis in a mouse model</title>

	<description>Neonatal seizures pose a clinical challenge for their early detection, acute management, and mitigation of long-term comorbidities. A major cause of neonatal seizures is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy that results in seizures that are frequently refractory to the first-line anti-seizure medication phenobarbital (PB). One proposed mechanism for PB-inefficacy during neonatal seizures is the reduced expression and function of the neuron-specific K+/Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), the main neuronal Cl- extruder that maintains chloride homeostasis and influences the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition. To determine if PB-refractoriness after ischemic neonatal seizures is dependent upon KCC2 hypofunction and can be rescued by KCC2 functional enhancement, we investigated the recently developed KCC2 functional enhancer CLP290 in a CD-1 mouse model of refractory ischemic neonatal seizures quantified with vEEG. We report that acute CLP290 intervention can rescue PB-resistance, KCC2 expression, and the development of epileptogenesis after ischemic neonatal seizures. KCC2 phosphorylation sites have a strong influence over KCC2 activity and seizure susceptibility in adult experimental epilepsy models. Therefore, we investigated seizure susceptibility in two different knock-in mice in which either phosphorylation of S940 or T906/T1007 was prevented. We report that KCC2 phosphorylation regulates both neonatal seizure susceptibility and CLP290-mediated KCC2 functional enhancement. Our results validate KCC2 as a clinically relevant target for refractory neonatal seizures and provide insights for future KCC2 drug development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Increased Excitability and Heightened Magnitude of Long-term Potentiation at Hippocampal CA3-CA1 Synapses in a Mouse Model of Neonatal Hyperoxia Exposure</title>

	<description>Preterm infants exposed to supraphysiological oxygen (hyperoxia) during the neonatal period have hippocampal atrophy and cognitive dysfunction later in childhood and as adolescents. Previously, we reported that 14-week-old adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as newborns had spatial memory deficits and hippocampal shrinkage, findings that mirror those of adolescents who were born preterm. Area CA1 region of the hippocampus that is crucial for spatial learning and memory is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia exposure on hippocampal CA3-CA1 synaptic function. Male and female C57BL/6J mouse pups were continuously exposed to either 85% normobaric oxygen or air between postnatal days 2-14. Hippocampal slice electrophysiology at CA3-CA1 synapses was then performed at 14 weeks of age. We observed that hyperoxia exposed mice have heightened strength of basal synaptic transmission measured in input-output curves, increased fiber volley amplitude indicating increased axonal excitability, and heightened LTP magnitude at CA3-CA1 synapses, likely a consequence of increased postsynaptic depolarization during the tetanus. These data demonstrate that supraphysiological oxygen exposure during the critical neonatal developmental period leads to pathologically heightened CA3-CA1 synaptic function during early adulthood which may contribute to hippocampal shrinkage and learning and memory deficits we previously reported. Furthermore, these changes may account for cognitive disorders in children born preterm who were exposed to prolonged oxygen supplementation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Complexity and 1/f slope jointly reflect cortical states across different E/I balances</title>

	<description>Characterization of cortical states is essential for understanding brain functioning in the absence of external stimuli. The balance between excitation and inhibition and the number of non-redundant activity patterns, indexed by the 1/f slope and LZc respectively, distinguish cortical states. However, the relation between these two measures has not been characterized. Here we analyzed the relation between 1/f slope and LZc with two modeling approaches and in empirical human EEG and monkey ECoG data. We contrasted resting state with propofol anesthesia, which is known to modulate the excitation-inhibition balance. We found convergent results among all strategies employed, showing an inverse and not trivial monotonic relation between 1/f slope and complexity. This behavior was observed even when the signals' spectral properties were heavily manipulated, consistent at ECoG and EEG scales. Models also showed that LZc was strongly dependent on 1/f slope but independent of the signal's spectral power law's offset. Our results show that, although these measures have very distinct mathematical origins, they are closely related. We hypothesize that differentially entropic regimes could underlie the link between the excitation-inhibition balance and the vastness of repertoire of cortical systems.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: TDP-43 stabilizes transcripts encoding stress granule protein G3BP1: potential relevance to ALS/FTD</title>

	<description>TDP-43 nuclear depletion and concurrent cytoplasmic accumulation in vulnerable neurons is a hallmark feature of progressive neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cellular stress signalling and stress granule dynamics are now recognized to play a role in ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Defective stress granule assembly is associated with increased cellular vulnerability and death. G3BP1 (Ras-GAP SH3-domain-binding protein 1) is a critical stress granule assembly factor. Here, we define that TDP-43 stabilizes G3BP1 transcripts via direct binding of a highly conserved cis regulatory element within the 3'UTR. Moreover, we show in vitro and in vivo that nuclear TDP-43 depletion is sufficient to reduce G3BP1 protein levels. Finally, we establish that G3BP1 transcripts are reduced in ALS/FTD patient neurons bearing TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions/nuclear depletion. Thus, our data suggest that, in ALS/FTD, there is a compromised stress granule response in disease-affected neurons due to impaired G3BP1 mRNA stability caused by TDP-43 nuclear depletion. These data implicate TDP-43 and G3BP1 loss of function as contributors to disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Properties of the axial current of retinal ganglion cells at spike initiation</title>

	<description>The action potential of most vertebrate neurons initiates in the axon initial segment (AIS), and is then transmitted to the soma where it is regenerated by somatodendritic sodium channels. For successful transmission, the AIS must produce a strong axial current, so as to depolarize the soma to the threshold for somatic regeneration. Theoretically, this axial current depends on AIS geometry and Na+ conductance density. We measured the axial current of mouse RGCs using whole-cell recordings with post-hoc AIS labeling. We found that this current is large, implying high Na+ conductance density, and carries a charge that co-varies with capacitance so as to depolarize the soma by ~30 mV. Additionally, we observed that the axial current attenuates strongly with depolarization, consistent with sodium channel inactivation, but temporally broadens so as to preserve the transmitted charge. Thus, the AIS appears to be organized so as to reliably backpropagate the axonal action potential.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Detailed Organization of the Human Cerebellum Estimated by Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Within the Individual</title>

	<description>Distinct regions of the cerebellum connect to separate regions of the cerebral cortex forming a complex topography. While key properties of cerebellar organization have been revealed in group-averaged data, in-depth study of individuals provides an opportunity to discover functional-anatomical features that emerge at a higher spatial resolution. Here functional connectivity MRI was used to examine the cerebellum of two intensively-sampled individuals (each scanned across 31 MRI sessions). Connectivity to somatomotor cortex showed the expected crossed laterality and inversion of the body maps between the anterior and posterior lobes. A surprising discovery was connectivity to the primary visual cortex along the vermis with evidence for representation of the central field. Within the hemispheres, each individual displayed a hierarchical progression from the inverted anterior lobe somatomotor map through to higher-order association zones. The hierarchy ended near Crus I/II and then progressed in reverse order through to the upright somatomotor map in the posterior lobe. Evidence for a third set of networks was found in the most posterior extent of the cerebellum. Detailed analysis of the higher-order association networks around the Crus I/II apex revealed robust representations of two distinct networks linked to the default network, multiple networks linked to cognitive control, as well as a separate representation of a language network. While idiosyncratic spatial details emerged between subjects, each of these networks could be detected in both individuals, and small seed regions placed within the cerebellum recapitulated the full extent of the spatially-specific cerebral networks. The observation of multiple networks in juxtaposed regions at the Crus I/II apex confirms the importance of this zone to higher-order cognitive function and reveals new organizational details.</description>

Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) promotes a range of phenotypes depending on its intracellular concentration and dosing kinetics, including cell death. While this qualitative relationship has been well established, the quantitative and mechanistic aspects of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling are still being elucidated. Mitochondria, a putative source of intracellular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have recently been demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable to localized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; perturbations, eliciting a dramatic cell death response in comparison to similar cytosolic perturbations. We sought to improve our dynamic and mechanistic understanding of the mitochondrial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reaction network in HeLa cells by creating a kinetic model of this system and using it to explore basal and perturbed conditions. The model uses the most current quantitative proteomic and kinetic data available to predict reaction rates and steady-state concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its reaction partners within individual mitochondria. Time scales ranging from milliseconds to one hour were simulated. We predict that basal, steady-state mitochondrial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be in the low nM range (2–4 nM) and will be inversely dependent on the total pool of peroxiredoxin-3 (Prx3). Neglecting efflux of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the cytosol, the mitochondrial reaction network is expected to control perturbations well up to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rates ~50 μM/s (0.25 nmol/mg-protein/s), above which point the Prx3 system would be expected to collapse. Comparison of these results with redox Western blots of Prx3 and Prx2 oxidation states demonstrated reasonable trend agreement at short times (≤ 15 min) for a range of experimentally perturbed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rates. At longer times, substantial efflux of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the mitochondria to the cytosol was evidenced by peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) oxidation, and Prx3 collapse was not observed. A refined model using Monte Carlo parameter sampling was used to explore rates of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; efflux that could reconcile model predictions of Prx3 oxidation states with the experimental observations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qaOTtVEjQpE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Segmenting cell nuclei within microscopy images is a ubiquitous task in biological research and clinical applications. Unfortunately, segmenting low-contrast overlapping objects that may be tightly packed is a major bottleneck in standard deep learning-based models. We report a Nuclear Segmentation Tool (NuSeT) based on deep learning that accurately segments nuclei across multiple types of fluorescence imaging data. Using a hybrid network consisting of U-Net and Region Proposal Networks (RPN), followed by a watershed step, we have achieved superior performance in detecting and delineating nuclear boundaries in 2D and 3D images of varying complexities. By using foreground normalization and additional training on synthetic images containing non-cellular artifacts, NuSeT improves nuclear detection and reduces false positives. NuSeT addresses common challenges in nuclear segmentation such as variability in nuclear signal and shape, limited training sample size, and sample preparation artifacts. Compared to other segmentation models, NuSeT consistently fares better in generating accurate segmentation masks and assigning boundaries for touching nuclei.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6H1w9aq1dx0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells adjust their metabolism in response to mutations, but how this reprogramming depends on the genetic context is not well known. Specifically, the absence of individual enzymes can affect reprogramming, and thus the impact of mutations in cell growth. Here, we examine this issue with an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae’s&lt;/i&gt; metabolism. By quantifying the variability in the growth rate of 10000 different mutant metabolisms that accumulated changes in their reaction fluxes, in the presence, or absence, of a specific enzyme, we distinguish a subset of modifier genes serving as buffers or potentiators of variability. We notice that the most potent modifiers refer to the glycolysis pathway and that, more broadly, they show strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Moreover, the evidence that this subset depends on the specific growing condition strengthens its systemic underpinning, a feature only observed before in a toy model of a gene-regulatory network. Some of these enzymes also modulate the effect that biochemical noise and environmental fluctuations produce in growth. Thus, the reorganization of metabolism induced by mutations has not only direct physiological implications but also transforms the influence that other mutations have on growth. This is a general result with implications in the development of cancer therapies based on metabolic inhibitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s2w3TaMvmvA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intracellular spatial heterogeneity is frequently observed in bacteria, where the chromosome occupies part of the cell’s volume and a circuit’s DNA often localizes within the cell. How this heterogeneity affects core processes and genetic circuits is still poorly understood. In fact, commonly used ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of genetic circuits assume a well-mixed ensemble of molecules and, as such, do not capture spatial aspects. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) models have been only occasionally used since they are difficult to integrate and do not provide mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we derive a reduced ODE model that captures spatial effects, yet has the same dimension as commonly used well-mixed models. In particular, the only difference with respect to a well-mixed ODE model is that the association rate constant of binding reactions is multiplied by a coefficient, which we refer to as the binding correction factor (BCF). The BCF depends on the size of interacting molecules and on their location when fixed in space and it is equal to unity in a well-mixed ODE model. The BCF can be used to investigate how spatial heterogeneity affects the behavior of core processes and genetic circuits. Specifically, our reduced model indicates that transcription and its regulation are more effective for genes located at the cell poles than for genes located on the chromosome. The extent of these effects depends on the value of the BCF, which we found to be close to unity. For translation, the value of the BCF is always greater than unity, it increases with mRNA size, and, with biologically relevant parameters, is substantially larger than unity. Our model has broad validity, has the same dimension as a well-mixed model, yet it incorporates spatial heterogeneity. This simple-to-use model can be used to both analyze and design genetic circuits while accounting for spatial intracellular effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iHe1xFAT38w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A disordered encounter complex is central to the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain binding pathway</title>

Protein-protein interactions are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. These interactions often involve intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein binding domains. However, the details of IDP binding pathways are hard to characterize using experimental approaches, which can rarely capture intermediate states present at low populations. SH3 domains are common protein interaction domains that typically bind proline-rich disordered segments and are involved in cell signaling, regulation, and assembly. We hypothesized, given the flexibility of SH3 binding peptides, that their binding pathways include multiple steps important for function. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the steps of binding between the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain (AbpSH3) and a proline-rich IDP, ArkA. Before binding, the N-terminal segment 1 of ArkA is pre-structured and adopts a polyproline II helix, while segment 2 of ArkA (C-terminal) adopts a 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helix, but is far less structured than segment 1. As segment 2 interacts with AbpSH3, it becomes more structured, but retains flexibility even in the fully engaged state. Binding simulations reveal that ArkA enters a flexible encounter complex before forming the fully engaged bound complex. In the encounter complex, transient nonspecific hydrophobic and long-range electrostatic contacts form between ArkA and the binding surface of SH3. The encounter complex ensemble includes conformations with segment 1 in both the forward and reverse orientation, suggesting that segment 2 may play a role in stabilizing the correct binding orientation. While the encounter complex forms quickly, the slow step of binding is the transition from the disordered encounter ensemble to the fully engaged state. In this transition, ArkA makes specific contacts with AbpSH3 and buries more hydrophobic surface. Simulating the binding between ApbSH3 and ArkA provides insight into the role of encounter complex intermediates and nonnative hydrophobic interactions for other SH3 domains and IDPs in general.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b4C6QlnTZ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Providing new insights on the biphasic lifestyle of the predatory bacterium &lt;i&gt;Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus&lt;/i&gt; through genome-scale metabolic modeling</title>

In this study we analyze the growth-phase dependent metabolic states of &lt;i&gt;Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus&lt;/i&gt; by constructing a fully compartmented, mass and charge-balanced genome-scale metabolic model of this predatory bacterium (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CH457). Considering the differences between life cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bacteriovorus&lt;/i&gt;’s in a rich medium based on its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the presence of “energy-saving” mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that predatory bacteria’s metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats. Overall, we present here a valuable computational testbed based on predatory bacteria activity for rational design of novel and controlled biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0JK3GT3FqQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Global change causes widespread decline of coral reefs. In order to counter the anticipated disappearance of coral reefs by the end of this century, many initiatives are emerging, including creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), reef restoration projects, and assisted evolution initiatives. Such efforts, although critically important, are locally constrained. We propose to build a “Noah's Ark” biological repository for corals that taps into the network of the world’s public aquaria and coral reef scientists. Public aquaria will serve not only as a reservoir for the purpose of conservation, restoration, and research of reef-building corals but also as a laboratory for the implementation of operations for the selection of stress-resilient and resistant genotypes. The proposed project will provide a global dimension to coral reef education and protection as a result of the involvement of a network of public and private aquaria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GT4HInMaQ5E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Two unequally redundant &quot;helper&quot; immune receptor families mediate &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; intracellular &quot;sensor&quot; immune receptor functions</title>

Plant nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor (NLR) proteins function as intracellular immune receptors that perceive the presence of pathogen-derived virulence proteins (effectors) to induce immune responses. The 2 major types of plant NLRs that “sense” pathogen effectors differ in their N-terminal domains: these are Toll/interleukin-1 receptor resistance (TIR) domain-containing NLRs (TNLs) and coiled-coil (CC) domain-containing NLRs (CNLs). In many angiosperms, the RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)-CC domain containing NLR (RNL) subclass of CNLs is encoded by 2 gene families, &lt;i&gt;ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ADR1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;N REQUIREMENT GENE 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt;), that act as “helper” NLRs during multiple sensor NLR-mediated immune responses. Despite their important role in sensor NLR-mediated immunity, knowledge of the specific, redundant, and synergistic functions of helper RNLs is limited. We demonstrate that the ADR1 and NRG1 families act in an unequally redundant manner in basal resistance, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and regulation of defense gene expression. We define RNL redundancy in ETI conferred by some TNLs and in basal resistance against virulent pathogens. We demonstrate that, in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, the 2 RNL families contribute specific functions in ETI initiated by specific CNLs and TNLs. Time-resolved whole genome expression profiling revealed that RNLs and “classical” CNLs trigger similar transcriptome changes, suggesting that RNLs act like other CNLs to mediate ETI downstream of sensor NLR activation. Together, our genetic data confirm that RNLs contribute to basal resistance, are fully required for TNL signaling, and can also support defense activation during CNL-mediated ETI.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S08uZX3utkc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical variability in spinal muscular atrophy type III</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25900?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25900?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report natural history data in a large cohort of 199 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III patients assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). The aim of the study was to establish annual rate and possible patterns of progression according to a number of variables, such as age of onset, age at assessment, &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number and functional status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFMSE longitudinal changes were assessed using piecewise linear mixed‐effects models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependency in the data due to repeated measures was accounted for by a random intercept per individual and an unstructured covariance R matrix was used as correlation structure. An additional descriptive analysis was performed for 123 patients, for a total of 375 12‐month assessments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break point at age 7 was set for the whole cohort and for SMA IIIA and IIIB. Age, SMA type and ambulatory status were significantly associated with changes in mean HFMSE score while sex and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in response before the break point of age 7 is significant only for SMA IIIA (β = 1.79, p &amp;lt; .0001). After the break point the change in the rate of HFMSE score significantly decrease for both SMA IIIA (β = −1.15, p &amp;lt; .0001) and IIIB (β = −0.69, p = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the natural history of type III SMA and will be helpful in the interpretation of the real‐world data of patients treated with commercially available drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The connectome of the Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/73a94e26-4c82-408a-a8f2-6e234d85018d/cne24932-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reconstructed the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; adult hermaphrodite pharyngeal nervous system from serial section electron micrographs to generate a weighted pharyngeal connectome. We subjected the pharyngeal wiring diagram to a set of visual, graph theoretic, statistical, and fluorescent‐reporter analyses, revealing a shallow neural structure. Together, our study shows that most pharyngeal neurons exhibit sensory‐motor characteristics, similar to primitive nervous systems comprised of “ur‐neurons.”

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial electron micrograph (EM) reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared with the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Precuneus (PreC) layer III projection neurons, which contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD) are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression profiling of PreC CatD‐ positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in tissue from subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD that was not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the default mode memory network.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzymes and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical projection neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of PreC CatD ‐positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Chemospecific deficits in taste sensitivity following bilateral or right hemispheric gustatory cortex lesions in rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Chemospecific deficits in taste sensitivity following bilateral or right hemispheric gustatory cortex lesions in rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0ce6179b-03cc-41a7-ba93-129b66dc6865/cne24928-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague–Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13), or right (RGCX, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13) or left (LGCX, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Central afferents to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats and mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be10bec3-8b54-499b-ad7d-f424715b1fb0/cne24927-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rats and mice have similar patterns of retrogradely labeled neurons that project axons to the NTS.
Afferent neurons in the hypothalamus are glutamatergic, while those in the amygdala are GABAergic.
In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, NTS afferent neurons are distinct from neuroendocrine neurons.
Injecting retrograde tracers into the medial and lateral NTS subdivisions produce similar patterns of retrograde labeling.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain's primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt;/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc32a1&lt;/i&gt;/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Perineuronal nets and subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate auditory and multisensory nuclei in the intercollicular area of the midbrain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c880c36c-7f9e-4a4b-b49e-e052e42ddfd0/cne24926-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we show that staining for GABAergic cells (magenta) and perineuronal nets (green) differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs.

&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;GABAergic medium spiny neurons are the main neuronal population in the striatum. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by PA. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic medium spiny neurons are the main neuronal population in the striatum. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The aim of the present work is to analyze the effect of perinatal asphyxia on different subpopulations of GABAergic neurons in the striatum and to assess the outcome of deep therapeutic hypothermia. The uterus of pregnant rats was removed by cesarean section and the fetuses were exposed to hypoxia by immersion in water (19 min) at 37°C (perinatal asphyxia). The hypothermic group was exposed to 10°C during 30 min after perinatal asphyxia. The rats were euthanized at the age of one month (adolescent/adult rats), their brains were dissected out and coronal sections were immunolabeled for calbindin, calretinin, NeuN, and reelin. Reelin+ cells showed no staining in the striatum besides subventricular zone. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by PA. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons. Similarly, there was a reduction of the diameter of the anterior commissure produced by the asphyxia that was prevented by hypothermic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24924?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/885caf37-8042-4519-9578-ec3c0b4c9dc6/cne24924-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase comprises α (&lt;i&gt;Atp1a&lt;/i&gt;), β (&lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt;), and FXYD subunits, and each subunit has isoforms. In situ hybridization for α and β subunit isoforms revealed regional‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of the isoforms in the mouse brain. The photograph shows &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; (red) and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; (green) expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (stained with DAPI, blue).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain. &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in neurons, whereas &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt; was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin (PV)‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt; isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The PV‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b1&lt;/i&gt; and a low level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1b3&lt;/i&gt;. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differences in behavior between surface and cave Astyanax mexicanus may be mediated by changes in catecholamine signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differences in behavior between surface and cave Astyanax mexicanus may be mediated by changes in catecholamine signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd498fc9-9d63-4186-b2dc-e0fa8f026462/cne24923-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleost fish &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with nonvisual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Activation Relaxation: A Local Dynamical Approximation to Backpropagation in the Brain. (arXiv:2009.05359v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05359</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Can the powerful backpropagation of error (backprop) reinforcement learning
algorithm be formulated in a manner suitable for implementation in neural
circuitry? The primary challenge is to ensure that any candidate formulation
uses only local information, rather than relying on global (error) signals, as
in orthodox backprop. Recently several algorithms for approximating backprop
using only local signals, such as predictive coding and equilibrium-prop, have
been proposed. However, these algorithms typically impose other requirements
which challenge biological plausibility: for example, requiring complex and
precise connectivity schemes (predictive coding), or multiple sequential
backwards phases with information being stored across phases
(equilibrium-prop). Here, we propose a novel local algorithm, Activation
Relaxation (AR), which is motivated by constructing the backpropagation
gradient as the equilibrium point of a dynamical system. Our algorithm
converges robustly and exactly to the correct backpropagation gradients,
requires only a single type of neuron, utilises only a single backwards phase,
and can perform credit assignment on arbitrary computation graphs. We
illustrate these properties by training deep neural networks on visual
classification tasks, and we describe simplifications to the algorithm which
remove further obstacles to neurobiological implementation (for example, the
weight-transport problem, and the use of nonlinear derivatives), while
preserving performance.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Integration of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire-Neurons in Deep Learning Architectures. (arXiv:2004.13532v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13532</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13532</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Up to now, modern Machine Learning is mainly based on fitting high
dimensional functions to enormous data sets, taking advantage of huge hardware
resources. We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the
Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons provide novel and efficient ways of
information encoding. They can be integrated in Machine Learning models, and
are a potential target to improve Machine Learning performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we derived simple update-rules for the LIF units from the differential
equations, which are easy to numerically integrate. We apply a novel approach
to train the LIF units supervisedly via backpropagation, by assigning a
constant value to the derivative of the neuron activation function exclusively
for the backpropagation step. This simple mathematical trick helps to
distribute the error between the neurons of the pre-connected layer. We apply
our method to the IRIS blossoms image data set and show that the training
technique can be used to train LIF neurons on image classification tasks.
Furthermore, we show how to integrate our method in the KERAS (tensorflow)
framework and efficiently run it on GPUs. To generate a deeper understanding of
the mechanisms during training we developed interactive illustrations, which we
provide online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this study we want to contribute to the current efforts to enhance
Machine Intelligence by integrating principles from biology.

Here, Mansouri and colleagues discuss the distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions thought to underlie the formation, maintenance and implementation of abstract rules and propose a unified framework describing the neural architecture of rule-guided primate behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/QOEDqeE0OLY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Vital Signs Detect Information Processing Differences When Neuromodulation Is Used During Cognitive Skills Training</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00358</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00358</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neuromodulation through translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) has been shown to initiate long-lasting processes of neuronal reorganization with a variety of outcomes (i.e., neuroplasticity). Non-invasive TLNS is increasingly accessible through the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;), a medical device that delivers electrical stimulation to the tongue to activate the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) cranial nerves. Anecdotal reports from previous clinical studies have suggested incidental improvements in cognitive function. To objectively explore this observation, we examined TLNS-related effects on the semantic N400 brain vital sign cognitive response during cognitive skills training in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomized to receive simultaneous TLNS (treatment) or no TLNS (control) while undergoing cognitive skills training. Cognitive training was conducted for two 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon/evening) over 3 consecutive days. Brain vital signs were evaluated at baseline, Day 1, and Day 3. Analyses focused on cognitive processing as measured by N400 changes in amplitude and latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over the 3-day course of cognitive training, the N400 amplitude decreased significantly in the control group due to habituation (p = 0.028). In contrast, there was no significant change in the TLNS treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: TLNS led to a sustained N400 response during cognitive skills training, as measured by the brain’s vital signs framework. The study findings suggest differential learning effects due to neuromodulation, consistent with increased attention and cognitive vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dropout in Neural Networks Simulates the Paradoxical Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00273</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00273</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) are a promising treatment for memory-related disorders including anxiety, addiction, and dementia. However, the outcomes of such treatments appear to be somewhat paradoxical, in that these techniques can both disrupt and enhance memory even when applied to the same brain target. In this article, we hypothesize that disruption and enhancement of memory through neuromodulation can be explained by the dropout of engram nodes. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits and letters and applied dropout at different stages to simulate DBS effects on engrams. We showed that dropout applied during training improved the accuracy of prediction, whereas dropout applied during testing dramatically decreased the accuracy of prediction, which mimics enhancement and disruption of memory, respectively. We further showed that transfer learning of neural networks with dropout had increased the accuracy and rate of learning. Dropout during training provided a more robust “skeleton” network and, together with transfer learning, mimicked the effects of chronic DBS on memory. Overall, we showed that the dropout of engram nodes is a possible mechanism by which neuromodulation techniques such as DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory, providing a unique perspective on this paradox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>To characterize how protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks change, we quantified the relative PPI abundance of 1.6 million protein pairs in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; across 9 growth conditions, with replication, for a total of 44 million measurements. Our multi-condition screen identified 13,764 pairwise PPIs, a 3-fold increase over PPIs identified in one condition. A few 'immutable' PPIs are present across all conditions, while most 'mutable' PPIs are rarely observed. Immutable PPIs aggregate into highly connected 'core' network modules, with most network remodeling occurring within a loosely connected 'accessory' module. Mutable PPIs are less likely to co-express, co-localize, and be explained by simple mass action kinetics, and more likely to contain proteins with intrinsically disordered regions, implying that environment-dependent association and binding is critical to cellular adaptation. Our results show that protein interactomes are larger than previously thought and contain highly dynamic regions that reorganize to drive or respond to cellular changes.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structure of the bacterial ribosome at 2 Å resolution</title>

	<description>Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the structure of the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;70S ribosome with a global resolution of 2.0 Å. The maps reveal unambiguous positioning of protein and RNA residues, their detailed chemical interactions, and chemical modifications. Notable features include the first examples of isopeptide and thioamide backbone substitutions in ribosomal proteins, the former likely conserved in all domains of life. The maps also reveal extensive solvation of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit, and interactions with A-site and P-site tRNAs, mRNA, and the antibiotic paromomycin. The maps and models of the bacterial ribosome presented here now allow a deeper phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal components including structural conservation to the level of solvation. The high quality of the maps should enable future structural analysis of the chemical basis for translation and aid the development of robust tools for cryo-EM structure modeling and refinement.</description>

	<title>eLife: Vascular control of the CO2/H+ dependent drive to breathe</title>

	<description>Respiratory chemoreceptors regulate breathing in response to changes in tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Blood flow is a fundamental determinant of tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, yet little is known regarding how regulation of vascular tone in chemoreceptor regions contributes to respiratory behavior. Previously, we showed in rat that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-vasoconstriction in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) supports chemoreception by a purinergic-dependent mechanism (Hawkins et al. 2017). Here, we show in mice that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dilates arterioles in other chemoreceptor regions, thus demonstrating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vascular reactivity in the RTN is unique. We also identify P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as the substrate responsible for this response. Specifically, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from smooth muscle cells blunted the ventilatory response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and re-expression of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors only in RTN smooth muscle cells fully rescued the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chemoreflex. These results identify P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as requisite determinants of respiratory chemoreception.</description>

	<description>The proportion of research outputs published in open access journals or made available on other freely-accessible platforms has increased over the past two decades, driven largely by funder mandates, institutional policies, grass-roots advocacy, and changing attitudes in the research community. However, the relative effectiveness of these different interventions has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a robust, transparent and updateable method for analysing how these interventions affect the open access performance of individual institutes. We studied 1,207 institutions from across the world, and found that, in 2017, the top-performing universities published around 80-90% of their research open access. The analysis also showed that publisher-mediated (gold) open access was popular in Latin American and African universities, whereas the growth of open access in Europe and North America has mostly been driven by repositories.</description>

	<title>eLife: TMEM79/MATTRIN defines a pathway for Frizzled regulation and is required for Xenopus embryogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56793</guid>

	<description>Wnt signaling through the Frizzled (FZD) family of serpentine receptors is essential for embryogenesis and homeostasis, and stringent control of the FZD protein level is critical for stem cell regulation. Through CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening in human cells, we identified TMEM79/MATTRIN, an orphan multi-span transmembrane protein, as a specific inhibitor of Wnt/FZD signaling. TMEM79 interacts with FZD during biogenesis and promotes FZD degradation independent of ZNRF3/RNF43 ubiquitin ligases (R-spondin receptors). TMEM79 interacts with &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;biquitin-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;pecific &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;rotease 8 (USP8), whose activating mutations underlie human tumorigenesis. TMEM79 specifically inhibits USP8 deubiquitination of FZD, thereby governing USP8 substrate specificity and promoting FZD degradation. Tmem79 and Usp8 genes have a pre-bilaterian origin, and Tmem79 inhibition of Usp8 and Wnt signaling is required for anterior neural development and gastrulation in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos. &lt;i&gt;TMEM79&lt;/i&gt; is a predisposition gene for Atopic dermatitis, suggesting deregulation of Wnt/FZD signaling a possible cause for this most common yet enigmatic inflammatory skin disease.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Impact of network‐targeted multichannel transcranial direct current stimulation on intrinsic and network‐to‐network functional connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Impact of network‐targeted multichannel transcranial direct current stimulation on intrinsic and network‐to‐network functional connectivity&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fdaf8c12-fee5-4d7c-b7c9-72d40dd55164/jnr24690-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on physiological data, biophysical modeling allows the optimization of tDCS montages for stimulation of brain networks. The efficacy of network‐targeted electrical stimulation is shown by the increase of spontaneous activity in the targeted network, as well as the modulation of its interplay with negatively correlated brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamics within and between functional resting‐state networks have a crucial role in determining both healthy and pathological brain functioning in humans. The possibility to noninvasively interact and selectively modulate the activity of networks would open to relevant applications in neuroscience. Here we tested a novel approach for multichannel, network‐targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net‐tDCS), optimized to increase excitability of the sensorimotor network (SMN) while inducing cathodal inhibitory modulation over prefrontal and parietal brain regions negatively correlated with the SMN. Using an MRI‐compatible multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) device, 20 healthy participants underwent real and sham tDCS while at rest in the MRI scanner. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) during and after stimulation were evaluated, looking at the intrinsic FC of the SMN and the strength of the negative connectivity between SMN and the rest of the brain. Standard, bifocal tDCS targeting left motor cortex (electrode ~C3) and right frontopolar (~Fp2) regions was tested as a control condition in a separate sample of healthy subjects to investigate network specificity of multichannel stimulation effects. Net‐tDCS induced greater FC increase over the SMN compared to bifocal tDCS, during and after stimulation. Moreover, exploratory analysis of the impact of net‐tDCS on negatively correlated networks showed an increase in the negative connectivity between SMN and prefrontal/parietal areas targeted by cathodal stimulation both during and after real net‐tDCS. Results suggest preliminary evidence of the possibility of manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns through net‐tDCS, with potential relevance for the development of cognitive enhancement and therapeutic tES solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neuronal gamma oscillations and activity‐dependent potassium transients remain regular after depletion of microglia in postnatal cortex tissue</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuronal gamma oscillations and activity‐dependent potassium transients remain regular after depletion of microglia in postnatal cortex tissue&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4aebaaef-01da-436b-ab29-e2f5d5bedad0/jnr24689-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of surveying microglia (resident immune cells) during cortical information processing in the healthy brain is widely unknown. This study shows that neuronal gamma oscillations emerging from precise synaptic communication between pyramidal cells and interneurons during higher brain functions remain regular after pharmacological removal of microglia from cortex tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglial cells (resident macrophages) feature rapid activation in CNS disease and can acquire multiple phenotypes exerting neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. The functional impact of surveying (“resting”) microglia on neural excitability and neurotransmission in physiology is widely unknown, however. We addressed this issue in male rat hippocampal slice cultures (in situ) by pharmacological microglial ablation within days and by characterizing neuronal gamma‐band oscillations (30–70 Hz) that are highly sensitive to neuromodulators and disturbances in ion and energy regulation. Gamma oscillations support action potential timing and synaptic plasticity, associate with higher brain functions like perception and memory, and require precise communication between excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons. The slice cultures featured well‐preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture and parvalbumin‐positive interneuron networks, microglia with ramified morphology, and low basal levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, and nitric oxide (NO). Stimulation of slice cultures with the pro‐inflammatory cytokine IFN‐γ or bacterial LPS serving as positive controls for microglial reactivity induced MHC‐II expression and increased cytokine and NO release. Chronic exposure of slice cultures to liposome‐encapsulated clodronate reduced the microglial cell population by about 96%, whereas neuronal structures, astrocyte GFAP expression, and basal levels of cytokines and NO were unchanged. Notably, the properties of gamma oscillations reflecting frequency, number and synchronization of synapse activity were regular after microglial depletion. Also, electrical stimulus‐induced transients of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) reflecting cellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, clearance and buffering were unchanged. This suggests that nonreactive microglia are dispensable for neuronal homeostasis and neuromodulation underlying network signaling and rhythm generation in cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Mutations in leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;/i&gt;) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Here, we generated a zebrafish &lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;/i&gt; allelic series to study the requirements for Lrrk2 during development and to dissect the importance of its various domains. The alleles are predicted to encode proteins that either lack all functional domains (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu304&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, the GTPase and kinase domains (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu71&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) or the kinase domain (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu96&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). We found that Wnt pathway activation is attenuated in &lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu304/sbu304&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, which lacks both scaffolding and catalytic domains, but not in the other alleles during late embryogenesis. This supports a model in which Lrrk2 scaffolding functions are key to a context‐dependent role in promoting canonical Wnt signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;/i&gt;) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Difficulty in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms resulting from disease‐associated Lrrk2 variants stems from the complexity of Lrrk2 function and activities. Lrrk2 contains multiple protein–protein interacting domains, a GTPase domain, and a kinase domain. Lrrk2 is implicated in many cellular processes including vesicular trafficking, autophagy, cytoskeleton dynamics, and Wnt signaling. Here, we generated a zebrafish &lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;/i&gt; allelic series to study the requirements for Lrrk2 during development and to dissect the importance of its various domains. The alleles are predicted to encode proteins that either lack all functional domains (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu304&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, the GTPase, and kinase domains (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu71&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) or the kinase domain (&lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu96&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). All three &lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;/i&gt; mutants are viable, morphologically normal, and display wild‐type‐like locomotion. Because Lrrk2 modulates Wnt signaling in some contexts, we assessed Wnt signaling in all three mutant lines. Analysis of Wnt signaling by studying the expression of target genes using whole mount RNA &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization and a transgenic Wnt reporter revealed wild‐type domains of Wnt activity in each of the mutants. However, we found that Wnt pathway activation is attenuated in &lt;i&gt;lrrk2&lt;sup&gt;sbu304/sbu304&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, which lacks both scaffolding and catalytic domains, but not in the other alleles during late embryogenesis. This supports a model in which Lrrk2 scaffolding functions are key to a context‐dependent role in promoting canonical Wnt signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron is essential for normal cellular function, however, excessive accumulation of iron in neural tissue has been implicated in both cortical and retinal diseases. The exact role of iron in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders remains incompletely understood. However, iron‐induced damage to the brain and retina is often attributed to the redox ability of iron to generate dangerous free radicals, which exacerbates local oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Iron chelators are compounds designed to scavenge labile iron, aiding to regulate iron bioavailability. Recently there has been growing interest in the application of chelating agents for treatment of diseases including neurodegenerative conditions, characterized by increased oxidative stress. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical evidence relating to the effectiveness of iron chelation therapy in conditions of iron dyshomeostasis linked to neurodegeneration in the brain and retina. The limitations as well as future opportunities iron chelation therapy are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Degron capability of the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin‐3</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Degron capability of the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin‐3&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/655a6f81-fca7-4f33-be5e-8e1ec3d417da/jnr24684-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 regulates its proteasomal degradation, with isoform 2 being more rapidly degraded. Fusion of the tail of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 to GFP also increases its proteasomal turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ataxin‐3 is a deubiquitinase and polyglutamine disease protein whose cellular properties and functions are not entirely understood. Mutations in ataxin‐3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder that is a member of the polyglutamine family of diseases. Two major isoforms arise from alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; and are differently toxic &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; as a result of faster proteasomal degradation of one isoform compared to the other. The isoforms vary only at their C‐termini, suggesting that the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the more quickly degraded form of ataxin‐3 (here referred to as isoform 2) functions as a degron—that is, a peptide sequence that expedites the degradation of its host protein. We explored this notion in this study and present evidence that: (a) the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 signals its degradation in a proteasome‐dependent manner, (b) this effect from the C‐terminus of isoform 2 does not require the ubiquitination of ataxin‐3, and (c) the isolated C‐terminus of isoform 2 can enhance the degradation of an unrelated protein. According to our data, the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 is a degron, increasing overall understanding of the cellular properties of the SCA3 protein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Synergistic PXT3003 therapy uncouples neuromuscular function from dysmyelination in male Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cc32764d-a9e3-4a30-a960-5af26780f086/jnr24679-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol synergistically contribute to PXT3003 effects on myelination in &lt;i&gt;Pmp22&lt;/i&gt; transgenic DRG co‐cultures (a) and motor phenotype in CMT1A rats (b). Recovery of neuromuscular junction innervation (c) plays a decisive role in the preservation of fast‐contracting motor fibers (d) which is uncoupled from dysmyelination in CMT1A rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 1 A (CMT1A) is caused by an intrachromosomal duplication of the gene encoding for &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; leading to peripheral nerve dysmyelination, axonal loss, and progressive muscle weakness. No therapy is available. PXT3003 is a low‐dose combination of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol which has been shown to improve disease symptoms in &lt;i&gt;Pmp22&lt;/i&gt; transgenic rats, a bona fide model of CMT1A disease. However, the superiority of PXT3003 over its single components or dual combinations have not been tested. Here, we show that in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co‐culture system derived from transgenic rats, PXT3003 induced myelination when compared to its single and dual components. Applying a clinically relevant (“translational”) study design in adult male CMT1A rats for 3 months, PXT3003, but not its dual components, resulted in improved performance in behavioral motor and sensory endpoints when compared to placebo. Unexpectedly, we observed only a marginally increased number of myelinated axons in nerves from PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats. However, in electrophysiology, motor latencies correlated with increased grip strength indicating a possible effect of PXT3003 on neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and muscle fiber pathology. Indeed, PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats displayed an increased perimeter of individual NMJs and a larger number of functional NMJs. Moreover, muscles of PXT3003 CMT1A rats displayed less neurogenic atrophy and a shift toward fast contracting muscle fibers. We suggest that ameliorated motor function in PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats result from restored NMJ function and muscle innervation, independent from myelination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: In vivo microstimulation with cathodic and anodic asymmetric waveforms modulates spatiotemporal calcium dynamics in cortical neuropil and pyramidal neurons of male mice</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;In vivo microstimulation with cathodic and anodic asymmetric waveforms modulates spatiotemporal calcium dynamics in cortical neuropil and pyramidal neurons of male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fbedd37f-3302-4c92-81a6-9fe6d4e19742/jnr24676-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical microstimulation can treat neurological disorders; however, the mechanisms defining therapeutic efficacy are poorly characterized. In the mouse cortex, increasing the stimulation waveform asymmetry differentially modulates the spatial distribution and level of sustained neuronal activation, depending on leading polarity, under mesoscale (top) and two‐photon (bottom) imaging. Blood vessels in red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation has been critical in the development of an understanding of brain function and disease. Despite its widespread use and obvious clinical potential, the mechanisms governing stimulation in the cortex remain largely unexplored in the context of pulse parameters. Modeling studies have suggested that modulation of stimulation pulse waveform may be able to control the probability of neuronal activation to selectively stimulate either cell bodies or passing fibers depending on the leading polarity. Thus, asymmetric waveforms with equal charge per phase (i.e., increasing the leading phase duration and proportionately decreasing the amplitude) may be able to activate a more spatially localized or distributed population of neurons if the leading phase is cathodic or anodic, respectively. Here, we use two‐photon and mesoscale calcium imaging of GCaMP6s expressed in excitatory pyramidal neurons of male mice to investigate the role of pulse polarity and waveform asymmetry on the spatiotemporal properties of direct neuronal activation with 10‐Hz electrical stimulation. We demonstrate that increasing cathodic asymmetry effectively reduces neuronal activation and results in a more spatially localized subpopulation of activated neurons without sacrificing the density of activated neurons around the electrode. Conversely, increasing anodic asymmetry increases the spatial spread of activation and highly resembles spatiotemporal calcium activity induced by conventional symmetric cathodic stimulation. These results suggest that stimulation polarity and asymmetry can be used to modulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity thus increasing the effective parameter space of electrical stimulation to restore sensation and study circuit dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Resting‐state connectivity and network parameter analysis in alcohol‐dependent males. A simultaneous EEG‐MEG study</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Resting‐state connectivity and network parameter analysis in alcohol‐dependent males. A simultaneous EEG‐MEG study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3fdd2ce3-d051-4b57-a7df-42432ace9dc5/jnr24673-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol‐dependent individuals present a differential pattern of resting‐state EEG‐MEG connectivity, as well as local communication alterations in brain network. Results point toward difficulties in information flow efficiency and cost, and a possible compensatory effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is supporting evidence of alcohol negative effects on the brain: neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies finding anatomical and functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with the dependence process. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate brain FC and network characteristics of alcohol‐dependent individuals in resting state. For this study, we included males diagnosed with alcohol dependence (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 25) and a group of healthy individuals (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 23). Simultaneous EEG‐MEG (electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic) activity was recorded in 5 min of eyes‐closed resting state. EEG‐MEG activity was preprocessed and FC was computed through the leakage‐corrected version of phase locking value (ciPLV). Additionally, local (degree, efficiency, clustering) and global (efficiency, characteristic path length) network parameters were computed. Connectivity analysis showed an increase in phase‐lagged synchronization, mainly between frontal and frontotemporal regions, in high beta band, and a decrease in interhemispheric gamma, for alcohol‐dependent individuals. Network analysis revealed intergroup differences at the local level for high beta, indicating higher degree, clustering, and efficiency, mostly at frontal nodes, together with a decrease in these measures at more posterior sites for patients’ group. The hyper‐synchronization in beta, next to the hypo‐synchronization in gamma, could indicate an alteration in communication between hemispheres, but also a possible functional compensation mechanism in neural circuits. This could be also supported by network characteristic data, where local alterations in communication are observed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Amyloidosis is associated with thicker myelin and increased oligodendrogenesis in the adult mouse brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Amyloidosis is associated with thicker myelin and increased oligodendrogenesis in the adult mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e6d96954-790f-4c0c-90f2-66e0a56a866b/jnr24672-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myelin structure is altered in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing a pathological variant of the human amyloid precursor protein (PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;APP mice&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;APP&lt;/i&gt; mice have longer paranodes, thicker myelin, and shorter nodes of Ranvier than wildtype mice by 3 months of age, however, total axon density and the proportion of axons that were myelinated was normal. Between 4 and 6 months of age, &lt;i&gt;APP&lt;/i&gt; mice have more new oligodendrocytes added to the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria, while total oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell density remained stable, suggesting that new oligodendrocytes may be produced to replace oligodendrocytes lost due to amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaque formation is associated with the focal death of oligodendrocytes and soluble amyloid β impairs the survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to early amyloid pathology remains unclear. To explore this, we performed a histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral characterization of transgenic mice expressing a pathological form of human &lt;i&gt;amyloid precursor protein&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;APP&lt;/i&gt;), containing three single point mutations associated with the development of familial Alzheimer's disease (&lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, also known as J20 mice). &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice had impaired survival from weaning, were hyperactive by 2 months of age, and developed amyloid plaques by 6 months of age, however, their spatial memory remained intact over this time course. Hippocampal OPC density was normal in P60‐P180 &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice and, by performing whole‐cell patch‐clamp electrophysiology, we found that their membrane properties, including their response to kainate (100 µM), were largely normal. However, by P100, the response of hippocampal OPCs to GABA was elevated in &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. We also found that the nodes of Ranvier were shorter, the paranodes longer, and the myelin thicker for hippocampal axons in young adult &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice compared with wildtype littermates. Additionally, oligodendrogenesis was normal in young adulthood, but increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria of &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice as pathology developed. As the new oligodendrocytes were not associated with a change in total oligodendrocyte number, these cells are likely required for cell replacement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Direct arterial damage and neurovascular unit disruption by mechanical thrombectomy in a rat stroke model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dfdfa60e-9469-4363-8939-c9a89f64c442/jnr24671-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that MT causes mechanical damage of vessel intima, as well as neutrophil, VEGF, and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption leading to the increase of infarct volume and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, when combined with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke that could cause hemorrhagic complications. We aimed to evaluate the pathology of MT‐induced arterial damage and neurovascular unit (NVU) disruption in relation to tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) injection for acute ischemic stroke. We induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male SHR/Izm rats for 2 hr. This was followed by reperfusion with/without tPA (3 mg/kg) and “rough suture” insertion that mimicked MT once or thrice (MT1 or MT3). Compared with the control group, the tPA + MT3 group presented with an increase in the cerebral infarct and hemorrhage with severer IgG leakage. Moreover, structural damage reaching the tunica media was detected in the MT3 and tPA + MT3 groups. The tPA + MT3 group presented with increased matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression with some MMP9‐positive cells expressing a neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase. Furthermore, basal lamina detachment from astrocyte foot processes was observed in the tPA + MT1 and tPA + MT3 groups. These findings suggest that MT causes direct arterial damage, as well as VEGF and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, especially when combined with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Outcome measures from experimental traumatic brain injury in male rats vary with the complete temporal biomechanical profile of the injury event</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Outcome measures from experimental traumatic brain injury in male rats vary with the complete temporal biomechanical profile of the injury event&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5730f62b-b363-4cc5-96d6-9c66d3d12b7f/jnr24670-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injury to the brain can vary greatly due to differences in the biomechanics of the traumatic event. This study demonstrates that the sequelae of neuronal loss and behavioral outcomes are related to the rate, peak, and impulse of the injury. Left: Neuronal degeneration for fast‐rate injury is lower than slow‐rate injuries. *&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05. Right: Chronic neuronal loss is equivalent across injury rates *&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 compared to sham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year wherein the outcomes associated with injury can vary greatly between individuals. This study postulates that variations in each biomechanical parameter of a head trauma lead to differences in histological and behavioral outcome measures that should be considered collectively in assessing injury. While trauma severity typically scales with the magnitude of injury, much less is known about the effects of rate and duration of the mechanical insult. In this study, a newly developed voice‐coil fluid percussion injury system was used to investigate the effects of injury rate and fluid percussion impulse on a collection of post‐injury outcomes in male rats. Collectively the data suggest a potential shift in the specificity and progression of neuronal injury and function rather than a general scaling of injury severity. While a faster, shorter fluid percussion first presents as a mild TBI, neuronal loss and some behavioral tasks were similar among the slower and faster fluid percussion injuries. This study concludes that the sequelae of neuronal degeneration and behavioral outcomes are related to the complete temporal profile of the fluid percussion and do not scale only with peak pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Caudate nuclei volume alterations and cognition and mood dysfunctions in adolescents with single ventricle heart disease</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Caudate nuclei volume alterations and cognition and mood dysfunctions in adolescents with single ventricle heart disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5ad33b4d-fe5f-4c04-83ae-6c00abe05783/jnr24667-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) adolescents accompany smaller caudate nuclei volumes, localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal sites, regions that have projections to memory and mood regulatory areas. These data suggest that SVHD adolescents have brain structural basis for deficient functions in the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) exhibit mood and cognitive deficits, which may result from injury to the basal ganglia structures, including the caudate nuclei. However, the integrity of the caudate in SVHD adolescents is unclear. Our aim was to examine the global and regional caudate volumes, and evaluate the relationships between caudate volumes and cognitive and mood scores in SVHD and healthy adolescents. We acquired two high‐resolution T1‐weighted images from 23 SVHD and 37 controls using a 3.0‐Tesla MRI scanner, as well as assessed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9]; Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning–2; General Memory Index [GMI]) functions. Both left and right caudate nuclei were outlined, which were then used to calculate and compare volumes between groups using ANCOVA (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size), as well as perform 3D surface morphometry. Partial correlations (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size) were used to examine associations between caudate volumes, cognition, and mood scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD subjects showed significantly higher PHQ‐9 and BAI scores, indicating more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduced GMI scores, suggesting impaired cognition, compared to controls. SVHD patients showed significantly reduced caudate volumes (left, 3,198.8 ± 490.1 vs. 3,605.0 ± 480.4 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.004; right, 3,162.1 ± 475.4 vs. 3,504.8 ± 465.9 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.011) over controls, and changes were localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal areas. Significant negative correlations emerged between caudate volumes with PHQ‐9 and BAI scores and positive correlations with GMI and MoCA scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD adolescents show significantly reduced caudate volumes, especially in sites that have projections to regulate mood and cognition, which may result from developmental and/or hypoxia‐/ischemia‐induced processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Partial deletion of p75NTR in large‐diameter DRG neurons exerts no influence upon the survival of peripheral sensory neurons in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Partial deletion of p75NTR in large‐diameter DRG neurons exerts no influence upon the survival of peripheral sensory neurons in vivo&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d1463bb0-f845-4e24-bd7a-2d3136ef1aad/jnr24665-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellular mechanism underpinning the p75NTR receptor regulated peripheral neuron survival is unclear. We identify that neuronal p75NTR expression is not essential for maintaining peripheral sensory neuron survival in health and after demyelinating neuropathy, providing new insights into the mechanism of p75NTR mediated peripheral nervous system functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;) is required for maintaining peripheral sensory neuron survival and function; however, the underlying cellular mechanism remains unclear. The general view is that expression of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; by the neuron itself is required for maintaining sensory neuron survival and myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Adopting a neuronal‐specific conditional knockout strategy, we demonstrate the partial depletion of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; in neurons exerts little influence upon maintaining sensory neuron survival and peripheral nerve myelination in health and after demyelinating neuropathy. Our data show that the density and total number of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in 2‐month‐old mice is not affected following the deletion of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; in large‐diameter myelinating neurons, as assessed by stereology. Adopting experimental autoimmune neuritis induced in adult male mice, an animal model of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, we identify that deleting p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; in myelinating neurons exerts no influence upon the disease progression, the total number of DRG neurons, and the extent of myelin damage in the sciatic nerve, indicating that the expression of neuronal p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; is not essential for maintaining peripheral neuron survival and myelination after a demyelinating insult &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Together, results of this study suggest that the survival and myelination of peripheral sensory neurons is independent of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; expressed by a subtype of neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the mechanism underpinning p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;‐mediated neuronal survival in the PNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Ciliary melanin‐concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is widely distributed in the murine CNS in a sex‐independent manner</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ciliary melanin‐concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is widely distributed in the murine CNS in a sex‐independent manner&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f1da7f0e-72cd-4619-abe6-714f7716068d/jnr24651-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report the distribution of a receptor found in primary cilia, describing an unprecedent wide distribution in the nervous system, differences between rodent species, and a lack of differences between males and females. Our results suggest melanin‐concentrating hormone may be used to target cilia in a large number of areas of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) is a ubiquitous vertebrate neuropeptide predominantly synthesized by neurons of the diencephalon that can act through two G protein‐coupled receptors, called MCHR1 and MCHR2. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Mchr1&lt;/i&gt; has been investigated in both rats and mice, but its synthesis remains poorly described. After identifying an antibody that detects MCHR1 with high specificity, we employed immunohistochemistry to map the distribution of MCHR1 in the CNS of rats and mice. Multiple neurochemical markers were also employed to characterize some of the neuronal populations that synthesize MCHR1. Our results show that MCHR1 is abundantly found in a subcellular structure called the primary &lt;i&gt;cilium&lt;/i&gt;, which has been associated, among other functions, with the detection of free neurochemical messengers present in the extracellular space. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in a wide range of areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortical mantle, &lt;i&gt;striatum&lt;/i&gt;, hippocampal formation, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, midbrain areas, and in the spinal cord. No differences were observed between male and female mice, and interspecies differences were found in the caudate‐putamen nucleus and the subgranular zone. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in close association with several neurochemical markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase, calretinin, kisspeptin, estrogen receptor, oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin‐releasing factor. Given the role of neuronal primary &lt;i&gt;cilia&lt;/i&gt; in sensing free neurochemical messengers in the extracellular fluid, the widespread distribution of ciliary MCHR1, and the diverse neurochemical populations who synthesize MCHR1, our data indicate that nonsynaptic communication plays a prominent role in the normal function of the MCH system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Depletion of microglia during cortical critical period profoundly alters glutamatergic synapse developmental trajectory

Microglia is critical for visual cortex spine pruning, circuit refinement, intracortical connectivity, and critical period plasticity




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglia populate the early developing brain and mediate pruning of the central synapses. Yet, little is known on their functional significance in shaping the developing cortical circuits. We hypothesize that the developing cortical circuits require microglia for proper circuit maturation and connectivity, and as such, ablation of microglia during the cortical critical period may result in a long‐lasting circuit abnormality. We administered PLX3397, a colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, to mice starting at postnatal day 14 and through P28, which depletes &amp;gt;75% of microglia in the visual cortex (VC). This treatment largely covers the critical period (P19‐32) of VC maturation and plasticity. Patch clamp recording in VC layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 neurons revealed increased mEPSC frequency and reduced amplitude, and decreased AMPA/NMDA current ratio, indicative of altered synapse maturation. Increased spine density was observed in these neurons, potentially reflecting impaired synapse pruning. In addition, VC intracortical circuit functional connectivity, assessed by laser scanning photostimulation combined with glutamate uncaging, was dramatically altered. Using two photon longitudinal dendritic spine imaging, we confirmed that spine elimination/pruning was diminished during VC critical period when microglia were depleted. Reduced spine pruning thus may account for increased spine density and disrupted connectivity of VC circuits. Lastly, using single‐unit recording combined with monocular deprivation, we found that ocular dominance plasticity in the VC was obliterated during the critical period as a result of microglia depletion. These data establish a critical role of microglia in developmental cortical synapse pruning, maturation, functional connectivity, and critical period plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Role of 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3 receptors in serotonergic activation of sensory neurons in relation to itch and pain behavior in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fe3e097c-4f46-49a0-a923-491cc8761fe1/jnr24633-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. We focused on the identification of the signaling pathways involved in the activation of rat primary afferent neurons by 5‐HT and their involvement in itch and pain sensing. Transient responses evoked by 5‐HT are mediated by ionotropic 5‐HT3 receptors. Sustained responses to 5‐HT require activation of 5‐HT1A receptors coupled to Gi/o, leading to a decrease in membrane conductance, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels and calcium entry. Both responses appear to be involved in triggering serotonergic itch in both male and female Wistar rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. The serotonergic receptors expressed by primary afferent neurons involved in these sensory functions are not fully identified and appear to be to a large extent species dependent. Moreover, the mechanisms through which 5‐HT receptor activation is coupled to changes in neuronal excitability have not been completely revealed. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; (calcium and voltage imaging and patch‐clamp) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; behavioral methods, we used both male and female Wistar rats to provide evidence for the involvement of two 5‐HT receptor subtypes, 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3, in mediating the sustained and transient effects, respectively, of 5‐HT on rat primary afferent neurons involved in pain and itch processing. In addition, our results are consistent with a model in which sustained serotonergic responses triggered via the 5‐HT1A receptor are due to closure of background potassium channels, followed by membrane depolarization and action potentials, during which the activation of voltage‐gated calcium channels leads to calcium entry. Our results may provide a better understanding of mammalian serotonergic itch signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of the African wild dog. II. The olfactory system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/93d58dc3-201f-4305-87a5-31cf0d264983/cne25007-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follows that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioral responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A proteomic view on the differential phenotype of Schwann cells derived from mouse sensory and motor nerves</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A proteomic view on the differential phenotype of Schwann cells derived from mouse sensory and motor nerves&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4f921665-4bab-4afe-a44d-8c303d963385/cne25018-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Location and size of preterm cerebellar hemorrhage and childhood development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) &lt;i&gt;size&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;location&lt;/i&gt; and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm MRIs of 221 very preterm neonates (median GA 27.9) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (MABC‐2), visuomotor integration (Beery VMI‐6), cognitive (WPPSI‐III), and behavioral (CBCL) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β=‐0.095, 95% CI [‐0.184, ‐0.005]) with a standardized β coefficient (‐0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β=‐0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxel‐wise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBH size and location on preterm MRI were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localisation of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensitivity–Specificity of Tau and Amyloid β Positron Emission Tomography in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25893?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations between tau and amyloid β (Aβ) molecular positron emission tomography (PET) and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients had [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐flortaucipir–PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], n = 10; FTLD‐TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)‐PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta‐ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Age‐related alterations in functional connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and its subfields</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Novel circular RNA 2960 contributes to secondary damage of spinal cord injury by sponging miRNA‐124</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Novel circular RNA 2960 contributes to secondary damage of spinal cord injury by sponging miRNA‐124&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e71e9998-4709-4967-a7ee-161601289945/cne25030-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific peripheral and central responses to stress‐induced depression and treatment in a mouse model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/256f68e9-1d23-442d-a1c7-3ee96b9a2e76/jnr24724-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social defeat stress induces sex‐specific inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses in the periphery and sex‐specific transcriptional regulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Treatment with dihydrocaffeic acid/malvidin‐glucoside modulates periphery inflammation and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates depression‐like phenotype. CSDS, chronic social defeat stress; DHCA, dihydrocaffeic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder affects ~20% of the world population and is characterized by strong sexual dimorphism with females being two to three times more likely to develop this disorder. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination therapy with dihydrocaffeic acid and malvidin‐glucoside to synergistically target peripheral inflammation and stress‐induced synaptic maladaptation in the brain was effective in alleviating chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)‐induced depression‐like phenotype in male mice. Here, we test the combination therapy in a female CSDS model for depression and compared sex‐specific responses to stress in the periphery and the central nervous system. Similar to male mice, the combination treatment is also effective in promoting resilience against the CSDS‐induced depression‐like behavior in female mice. However, there are sex‐specific differences in peripheral immune responses and differential gene regulation in the prefrontal cortex to chronic stress and to the treatment. These data indicate that while therapeutic approaches to combat stress‐related disorders may be effective in both sexes, the mechanisms underlying these effects differ, emphasizing the need for inclusion of both sexes in preclinical studies using animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option for refractory chronic cluster headache (CCH). Despite several recent prospective case series reporting a good outcome, the effectiveness and the optimal stimulation target of DBS for CCH remain unclear. We aimed to obtain precise estimates and predictors of long‐term pain relief in an individual patient data meta‐analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to construct a probabilistic stimulation map of effective DBS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited investigators of published cohorts of patients undergoing DBS for CCH, identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE from inception to Febuary 15, 2019, to provide individual patient data on baseline covariates, pre‐ and postoperative headache scores at median (12‐month) and long‐term follow‐up, in addition to individual imaging data to obtain individual electrode positions. We calculated a stimulation map using voxel‐wise statistical analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate predictors of pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 40 patients from four different cohorts representing ~50% of all previously published cases, we found a significant 77% mean reduction in headache attack frequency over a mean follow‐up of 44 months, with an overall response rate of 75%. Positive outcome was not associated with baseline covariates. We identified 2 hotspots of stimulation covering the midbrain ventral and retrorubral tegmentum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports the hypothesis that DBS provides long‐term pain relief for the majority of CCH patients. Our stimulation map of the region of influence of therapeutic DBS identified an optimal anatomical target site that can help surgeons to guide their surgical planning in the future.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25021?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/49422eee-17be-4e2d-92b7-dca59ead60ba/cne25021-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hrs postfertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene &lt;i&gt;hoxb1a&lt;/i&gt;; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of &lt;i&gt;prickle1b&lt;/i&gt;. Further, we investigate whether the previously described “pioneer” neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Photoreceptors in skate are arranged to allow for a broad horizontal field of view</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Photoreceptors in skate are arranged to allow for a broad horizontal field of view&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32234374-db88-4472-ac64-275c06558561/cne25014-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention. Skate &lt;i&gt;L. erinacea&lt;/i&gt; (left), and image of a whole‐mounted retina showing retinal photoreceptors (right).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea.&lt;/i&gt; We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor: ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal's anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks excel at finding hierarchical representations that solve
complex tasks over large data sets. How can we humans understand these learned
representations? In this work, we present network dissection, an analytic
framework to systematically identify the semantics of individual hidden units
within image classification and image generation networks. First, we analyze a
convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on scene classification and discover
units that match a diverse set of object concepts. We find evidence that the
network has learned many object classes that play crucial roles in classifying
scene classes. Second, we use a similar analytic method to analyze a generative
adversarial network (GAN) model trained to generate scenes. By analyzing
changes made when small sets of units are activated or deactivated, we find
that objects can be added and removed from the output scenes while adapting to
the context. Finally, we apply our analytic framework to understanding
adversarial attacks and to semantic image editing.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Network Guided-Reaction Diffusion-Model of AT[N] Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease. (arXiv:2009.04854v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04854</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04854</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, many studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are investigating the
neurobiological factors behind the acquisition of beta-amyloid (A), pathologic
tau (T), and neurodegeneration ([N]) biomarkers from neuroimages. However, a
system-level mechanism of how these neuropathological burdens promote
neurodegeneration and why AD exhibits characteristic progression is largely
elusive. In this study, we combined the power of systems biology and network
neuroscience to understand the dynamic interaction and diffusion process of
AT[N] biomarkers from an unprecedented amount of longitudinal Amyloid PET scan,
MRI imaging, and DTI data. Specifically, we developed a network-guided
biochemical model to jointly (1) model the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers at
each brain region and (2) characterize their propagation pattern across the
fiber pathways in the structural brain network, where the brain resilience is
also considered as a moderator of cognitive decline. Our biochemical model
offers a greater mathematical insight to understand the physiopathological
mechanism of AD progression by studying the system dynamics and stability.
Thus, an in-depth system-level analysis allows us to gain a new understanding
of how AT[N] biomarkers spread throughout the brain, capture the early sign of
cognitive decline, and predict the AD progression from the preclinical stage.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that generally preserves
semantics. Previous work has shown that recurrent neural networks are capable
of producing sketch drawings of a single or few classes at a time. In this work
we focus on the representations developed by training a generative model to
produce sketches from pixel images across many classes in a sketch domain. We
find that the embeddings learned by this sketching model are extremely
informative for visual tasks and infer compositional information. We then use
them to exceed state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised few-shot
classification on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet benchmarks. We also leverage
the generative capacity of our model to produce high quality sketches of novel
classes based on just a single example.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Histone Deacetylase 6 and the Disease Mechanisms of α-Synucleinopathies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The abnormal accumulation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a prominent pathological feature in a group of diseases called α-Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, is highly investigated. However, the molecular mechanisms behind α-Syn improper folding and aggregation remain unclear. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a Class II deacetylase, containing two active catalytic domains and a ubiquitin-binding domain. The properties of HDAC6 and its exclusive cytoplasmic localization allow HDAC6 to modulate the microtubule dynamics, acting as a specific α-tubulin deacetylase. Also, HDAC6 can bind ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating the formation of the aggresome, a cellular defense mechanism to cope with higher levels of misfolded proteins. Several studies report that the aggresome shares similarities in size and composition with LBs and GCIs. HDAC6 is found to co-localize with α-Syn in neurons and in oligodendrocytes, together with other aggresome-related proteins. The involvement of HDAC6 in several neurodegenerative diseases is already under discussion, however, the results obtained by modulating HDAC6 activity are not entirely conclusive. The main goal of this review is to summarize and critically discuss previous in vitro and in vivo data regarding the specific role of HDAC6 in the context of α-Syn accumulation and protein aggregation in α-Synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Food Anticipatory Activity on Circadian Time Scales Is Not Dependent on Central Serotonin: Evidence From Tryptophan Hydroxylase-2 and Serotonin Transporter Knockout Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.534238</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.534238</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A number of studies implicate biogenic amines in regulating circadian rhythms. In particular, dopamine and serotonin influence the entrainment of circadian rhythms to daily food availability. To study circadian entrainment to feeding, food availability is typically restricted to a short period within the light cycle daily. This results in a notable increase in pre-meal activity, termed “food anticipatory activity” (FAA), which typically develops within about 1 week of scheduled feeding. Several studies have implicated serotonin as a negative regulator of FAA: (1) aged rats treated with serotonin 5-HT2 and 3 receptor antagonists showed enhanced FAA, (2) mice lacking for the 2C serotonin receptor demonstrate enhanced FAA, and (3) pharmacologically increased serotonin levels suppressed FAA while decreased serotonin levels enhanced FAA in mice. We sought to confirm and extend these findings using genetic models with impairments in central serotonin production or re-uptake, but were surprised to find that both serotonin transporter (Slc6a4) and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 knockout mice demonstrated a normal behavioral response to timed, calorie restricted feeding. Our data suggest that FAA is largely independent of central serotonin and/or serotonin reuptake and that serotonin may not be a robust negative regulator of FAA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NWB Query Engines: Tools to Search Data Stored in Neurodata Without Borders Format</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Neurodata Without Borders (abbreviation NWB) format is a current technology for storing neurophysiology data along with the associated metadata. Data stored in the format is organized into separate HDF5 files, each file usually storing the data associated with a single recording session. While the NWB format provides a structured method for storing data, so far there have not been tools which enable searching a collection of NWB files in order to find data of interest for a particular purpose. We describe here three tools to enable searching NWB files. The tools have different features making each of them most useful for a particular task. The first tool, called the NWB Query Engine, is written in Java. It allows searching the complete content of NWB files. It was designed for the first version of NWB (NWB 1) and supports most (but not all) features of the most recent version (NWB 2). For some searches, it is the fastest tool. The second tool, called “search_nwb” is written in Python and also allow searching the complete contents of NWB files. It works with both NWB 1 and NWB 2, as does the third tool. The third tool, called “nwbindexer” enables searching a collection of NWB files using a two-step process. In the first step, a utility is run which creates an SQLite database containing the metadata in a collection of NWB files. This database is then searched in the second step, using another utility. Once the index is built, this two-step processes allows faster searches than are done by the other tools, but does not enable as complete of searches. All three tools use a simple query language which was developed for this project. Software integrating the three tools into a web-interface is provided which enables searching NWB files by submitting a web form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Motor and Predictive Processes in Auditory Beat and Rhythm Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578546</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578546</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we review recent advances in research on rhythm and musical beat perception, focusing on the role of predictive processes in auditory motor interactions. We suggest that experimental evidence of the motor system’s role in beat perception, including in passive listening, may be explained by the generation and maintenance of internal predictive models, concordant with the Active Inference framework of sensory processing. We highlight two complementary hypotheses for the neural underpinnings of rhythm perception: The Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction hypothesis (Patel and Iversen, 2014) and the Gradual Audiomotor Evolution hypothesis (Merchant and Honing, 2014) and review recent experimental progress supporting each of these hypotheses. While initial formulations of ASAP and GAE explain different aspects of beat-based timing–the involvement of motor structures in the absence of movement, and physical entrainment to an auditory beat respectively–we suggest that work under both hypotheses provide converging evidence toward understanding the predictive role of the motor system in the perception of rhythm, and the specific neural mechanisms involved. We discuss future experimental work necessary to further evaluate the causal neural mechanisms underlying beat and rhythm perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhancement of Facilitation Training for Aphasia by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573459</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573459</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We aimed to enhance the performance of naming and sentence production in chronic post-stroke aphasia by tablet-based language training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) conducted on non-consecutive days. We applied a deblocking method involved in stimulation–facilitation therapy to six participants with chronic aphasia who performed naming and sentence production tasks for impaired modalities, immediately after a spoken-word picture-matching task for an intact modality. The participants took part in two conditional sessions: a tDCS condition in which they performed a spoken word-picture matching task while we delivered an anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex; and a sham condition in which sham stimulation was delivered. We hypothesized that, compared with the sham stimulation, the application of anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex during the performance of tasks requiring access to semantic representations would enhance the deblocking effect, thereby improving the performances for subsequent naming and sentence production. Our results showed greater improvements 2 weeks after training with tDCS than those after training with sham stimulation. The accuracy rate of naming was significantly higher in the tDCS condition than in the sham condition, regardless of whether the words were trained or not. Also, we found a significant improvement in the production of related words and sentences for the untrained words in the tDCS condition, compared with that found pre-training, while in the sham condition we found no significant improvement compared with that found pre-training. These results support our hypothesis and suggest the effectiveness of the use of tDCS during language training on non-consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Neural Responses to the Perception of Social Interactions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social interaction is critical to emotional well-being. Previous studies have suggested sex differences in the perception of social interaction. However, the findings depend on the nature of interactions and whether it involves facial emotions. Here, we explored sex differences in neural responses to the perception of social interaction using the Human Connectome Project data. Participants (n = 969, 505 women) were engaged in a social cognition task with geometric objects moving and colliding to simulate social interaction. Behaviorally, men relative to women demonstrated higher accuracy in perceiving social vs. random interactions. Men vs. women showed higher activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and women vs. men showed higher activation in the right inferior frontal cortex, during exposure to social vs. random interactions. In whole-brain regressions, the differences in accuracy rate in identifying social vs. random interactions (AR&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt; – AR&lt;sub&gt;RAN&lt;/sub&gt;) were associated with higher activation in the paracentral lobule (PCL) and lower activation in bilateral anterior insula (AI), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in men and women combined, lower activation in bilateral AI, preSMA and left MFG in men alone, and higher activation in the PCL and the medial orbitofrontal cortex in women alone. The latter sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. Further, the PCL activity mediated the correlation between an internalizing syndromal score, as assessed by the Achenbach Self-Report, and (AR&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt; – AR&lt;sub&gt;RAN&lt;/sub&gt;) across all subjects. These findings highlighted sex differences in the behavioral and neural processes underlying the perception of social interaction, as well as the influence of internalizing traits on these processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Theoretical Framework for How We Learn Aesthetic Values</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do we come to like the things that we do? Each one of us starts from a relatively similar state at birth, yet we end up with vastly different sets of aesthetic preferences. These preferences go on to define us both as individuals and as members of our cultures. Therefore, it is important to understand how aesthetic preferences form over our lifetimes. This poses a challenging problem: to understand this process, one must account for the many factors at play in the formation of aesthetic values and how these factors influence each other over time. A general framework based on basic neuroscientific principles that can also account for this process is needed. Here, we present such a framework and illustrate it through a model that accounts for the trajectories of aesthetic values over time. Our framework is inspired by meta-analytic data of neuroimaging studies of aesthetic appraisal. This framework incorporates effects of sensory inputs, rewards, and motivational states. Crucially, each one of these effects is probabilistic. We model their interactions under a reinforcement-learning circuitry. Simulations of this model and mathematical analysis of the framework lead to three main findings. First, different people may develop distinct weighing of aesthetic variables because of individual variability in motivation. Second, individuals from different cultures and environments may develop different aesthetic values because of unique sensory inputs and social rewards. Third, because learning is stochastic, stemming from probabilistic sensory inputs, motivations, and rewards, aesthetic values vary in time. These three theoretical findings account for different lines of empirical research. Through our study, we hope to provide a general and unifying framework for understanding the various aspects involved in the formation of aesthetic values over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Retrospective Evaluation of Sequential Events and the Influence of Preference-Dependent Working Memory: A Computational Examination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans organize sequences of events into a single overall experience, and evaluate the aggregated experience as a whole, such as a generally pleasant dinner, movie, or trip. However, such evaluations are potentially computationally taxing, and so our brains must employ heuristics (i.e., approximations). For example, the peak-end rule hypothesis suggests that we average the peaks and end of a sequential event vs. integrating every moment. However, there is no general model to test viable hypotheses quantitatively. Here, we propose a general model and test among multiple specific ones, while also examining the role of working memory. The models were tested with a novel picture-rating task. We first compared averaging across entire sequences vs. the peak-end heuristic. Correlation tests indicated that averaging prevailed, with peak and end both still having significant prediction power. Given this, we developed generalized order-dependent and relative-preference-dependent models to subsume averaging, peak and end. The combined model improved the prediction power. However, based on limitations of relative-preference—including imposing a potentially arbitrary ranking among preferences—we introduced an absolute-preference-dependent model, which successfully explained the remembered utilities. Yet, because using all experiences in a sequence requires too much memory as real-world settings scale, we then tested “windowed” models, i.e., evaluation within a specified window. The windowed (absolute) preference-dependent (WP) model explained the empirical data with long sequences better than without windowing. However, because fixed-windowed models harbor their own limitations—including an inability to capture peak-event influences beyond a fixed window—we then developed discounting models. With (absolute) preference-dependence added to the discounting rate, the results showed that the discounting model reflected the actual working memory of the participants, and that the preference-dependent discounting (PD) model described different features from the WP model. Taken together, we propose a combined WP-PD model as a means by which people evaluate experiences, suggesting preference-dependent working-memory as a significant factor underlying our evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response: A Hinge Between Healthy and Pathological Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581849</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is the time-dependent functional decline that increases the vulnerability to different forms of stress, constituting the major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria significantly contribute to aging phenotypes, accumulating particularly in post-mitotic cells, including neurons. To cope with deleterious effects, mitochondria feature different mechanisms for quality control. One such mechanism is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;), which corresponds to the transcriptional activation of mitochondrial chaperones, proteases, and antioxidant enzymes to repair defective mitochondria. Transcription of target UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; genes is epigenetically regulated by Histone 3-specific methylation. Age-dependency of this regulation could explain a differential UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; activity in early developmental stages or aged organisms. At the same time, precise tuning of mitochondrial stress responses is crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis. However, compared to other mitochondrial and stress response programs, the role of UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; in neurodegenerative disease is barely understood and studies in this topic are just emerging. In this review, we document the reported evidence characterizing the evolutionarily conserved regulation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; and summarize the recent advances in understanding the role of the pathway in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of Embryonic Inflammation and Adolescent Psychosocial Environment on Cognition and Hippocampal Staufen in Middle-Aged Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578719</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578719</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence has indicated that embryonic inflammation could accelerate age-associated cognitive impairment, which can be attributed to dysregulation of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Staufen is a double-stranded RBP that plays a critical role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory. However, relatively few studies have investigated how embryonic inflammation affects cognition and neurobiology during aging, or how the adolescent psychosocial environment affects inflammation-induced remote cognitive impairment. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate whether these adverse factors can induce changes in Staufen expression, and whether these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment. In our study, CD-1 mice were administered lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or an equal amount of saline (control) intraperitoneally during days 15–17 of gestation. At 2 months of age, male offspring were randomly exposed to stress (S), an enriched environment (E), or not treated (CON) and then assigned to five groups: LPS, LPS+S, LPS+E, CON, and CON+S. Mice were evaluated at 3-month-old (young) and 15-month-old (middle-aged). Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test, while Staufen expression was examined at both the protein and mRNA level using immunohistochemistry/western blotting and RNAscope technology, respectively. The results showed that the middle-aged mice had worse cognitive performance and higher Staufen expression than young mice. Embryonic inflammation induced cognitive impairment and increased Staufen expression in the middle-aged mice, whereas adolescent stress/an enriched environment would accelerated/mitigated these effects. Meanwhile, Staufen expression was closely correlated with cognitive performance. Our findings suggested embryonic inflammation can accelerate age-associated learning and memory impairments, and these effects may be related to the Staufen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Afferent and Efferent Visual Markers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review and Update in Early Stage Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572337</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision, which requires extensive neural involvement, is often impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Over the last few decades, accumulating evidence has shown that various visual functions and structures are compromised in Alzheimer’s dementia and when measured can detect those with dementia from those with normal aging. These visual changes involve both the afferent and efferent parts of the visual system, which correspond to the sensory and eye movement aspects of vision, respectively. There are fewer, but a growing number of studies, that focus on the detection of predementia stages. Visual biomarkers that detect these stages are paramount in the development of successful disease-modifying therapies by identifying appropriate research participants and in identifying those who would receive future therapies. This review provides a summary and update on common afferent and efferent visual markers of AD with a focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical disease detection. We further propose future directions in this area. Given the ease of performing visual tests, the accessibility of the eye, and advances in ocular technology, visual measures have the potential to be effective, practical, and non-invasive biomarkers of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cerebral Fructose Metabolism as a Potential Mechanism Driving Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.560865</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.560865</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is pathologically linked with neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid deposition, and loss of neuronal communication. Cerebral insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as important contributors to pathogenesis supporting our hypothesis that cerebral fructose metabolism is a key initiating pathway for Alzheimer’s disease. Fructose is unique among nutrients because it activates a survival pathway to protect animals from starvation by lowering energy in cells in association with adenosine monophosphate degradation to uric acid. The fall in energy from fructose metabolism stimulates foraging and food intake while reducing energy and oxygen needs by decreasing mitochondrial function, stimulating glycolysis, and inducing insulin resistance. When fructose metabolism is overactivated systemically, such as from excessive fructose intake, this can lead to obesity and diabetes. Herein, we present evidence that Alzheimer’s disease may be driven by overactivation of cerebral fructose metabolism, in which the source of fructose is largely from endogenous production in the brain. Thus, the reduction in mitochondrial energy production is hampered by neuronal glycolysis that is inadequate, resulting in progressive loss of cerebral energy levels required for neurons to remain functional and viable. In essence, we propose that Alzheimer’s disease is a modern disease driven by changes in dietary lifestyle in which fructose can disrupt cerebral metabolism and neuronal function. Inhibition of intracerebral fructose metabolism could provide a novel way to prevent and treat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Non-linear Relationship Between Plasma Amyloid-β 40 Level and Cognitive Decline in a Cognitively Normal Population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.557005</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.557005</link>
	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Recent studies regarding the relationships between plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and cognitive performance had inconsistent results. In this study, we aimed to characterize the relationship between cognitive decline and plasma Aβ levels in a large-sample cognitively normal population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This population-based, prospective cohort study included 1,240 participants with normal cognition. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function at baseline and 2 years later. Restricted cubic splines, multivariate logistic regression, and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the type of relationship between cognitive decline during the 2-year follow-up period and plasma Aβ levels (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Participants with moderate Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; levels had the highest risk of cognitive decline during a 2-year follow-up relative to individuals with low Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; [odds ratio (OR): 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45–0.81, p &amp;lt; 0.001] or high Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49–0.87, p = 0.004) levels. The association between Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline did not depend on sex, education level, or APOE ε4 status. There was an interaction found between age (≤ 65 and &amp;gt; 65 years) and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (p for interaction = 0.021). In individuals older than 65 years, there was a positive linear relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04, p = 0.027). For participants ≤ 65 years old, the lower Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and higher Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; groups had a lower risk of cognitive decline than the medium Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; group (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50–0.94, p = 0.02; OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45–0.86, p = 0.004). None of relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline was found during a 2-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline was not linear, but an inverted-U shape in a cognitively normal population. The underlying mechanism requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Weaker Braking Force, A New Marker of Worse Gait Stability in Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.554168</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.554168</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Braking force is a gait marker associated with gait stability. This study aimed to determine the alteration of braking force and its correlation with gait stability in Alzheimer disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 32 AD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Gait parameters (braking force, gait variability, and fall risk) in the walking tests of Free walk, Barrier, and Count backward were measured by JiBuEn&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; gait analysis system. Gait variability was calculated by the coefficient of variation (COV) of stride time, stance time, and swing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The braking force of AD was significantly weaker than HCs in three walking tests (P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P = 0.007). Gait variability of AD showed significant elevation than HCs in the walking of Count backward (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.013; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.006). Fall risk of AD was significantly higher than HCs in three walking tests (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001). Braking force was negatively associated with fall risks in three walking tests (P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between braking force and gait variability in the walking of Free walk (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.018; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.013) and Barrier (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.002; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.001), but not Count backward (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.888; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.555).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Braking force was weaker in AD compared to HCs, reflecting the worse gait stability of AD. Our study suggests that weakening of braking force may be a new gait marker to indicate cognitive and motor impairment and predict fall risk in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Peripheral Adiponectin and Lipids Levels and the Therapeutic Response to Donepezil Treatment in Han Chinese Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.532386</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.532386</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) including donepezil (DNP) are considered to be the most promising therapeutic possibilities of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The response to DNP in AD patients varies and it is valuable to identify the potential markers that can predict the efficacy. Moreover, DNP has been found to affect bone function, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. Lipids and adipokine may link to AD and DNP directly or indirectly and might be potential biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among adiponectin (APN), lipids levels, and the response to DNP, and to identify whether the effect of DNP in AD treatment is related to its effect on the level of APN in systemic circulation. The study recruited 85 AD patients with DNP treatment, of whom 47 were DNP responders and 38 were DNP nonresponders. The Mini-Mental State Examination was performed to evaluate the memory impairment. Plasma APN was measured with ELISA. The genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1501299 and rs22417661 in APN for each patient were identified. Plasma lipids were quantified with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Correlations among APN, lipid metabolomics, and DNP responded were evaluated. APN was significantly decreased in DNP responders. Methyl stearate and glycerol-3-phosphate, used for characterizing adipogenic differentiation, were significantly decreased in DNP responders compared to DNP nonresponders. APN and small-molecule lipids can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of DNP. The results of metabolomics indicated that there was no change in the metabolic pathway of fatty acid metabolism and glucose metabolism in DNP responders, suggesting that APN-related biological function did not decrease in DNP responders. Our result suggests that more attention should be pay to the sources and biological functions of APN in AD with DNP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Balance Control in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00275</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00275</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recently, considerable research has been conducted to study the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on balance control in older adults. We completed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tDCS on balance control in this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A search strategy based on the PICOS principle was used to find the literatures in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science. The quality and risk of bias in the studies were independently assessed by two researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review. A meta-analysis was completed on six of these ten, with a total of 280 participants. As compared to sham (i.e., control), tDCS induced significant improvement with low heterogeneity in balance control in older adults. Specifically, tDCS induced large effects on the performance of the timed-up-and-go test, the Berg balance scale, and standing postural sway (e.g., sway area) and gait (e.g., walking speed) in dual task conditions (standardized mean differences (SMDs) = −0.99~3.41 95% confidence limits (CL): −1.52~4.50, p &amp;lt; 0.006, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 52%). Moderate-to-large effects of tDCS were also observed in the standing posture on a static or movable platform (SMDs = 0.37~1.12 95%CL: −0.09~1.62, p &amp;lt; 0.03, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 62%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that tDCS holds promise to promote balance in older adults. These results warrant future studies of larger sample size and rigorous study design and results report, as well as specific research to establish the relationship between the parameter of tDCS and the extent of tDCS-induced improvement in balance control in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Catecholamines in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00184</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00184</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Previous studies found inconsistent results regarding the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and catecholamines, such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the results of previous studies on this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Literature retrieval of eligible studies was performed in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and PsycARTICLES). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess differences in catecholamine concentrations between the AD groups and controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the controls, significant lower concentrations of NE (SMD = −1.10, 95% CI: −2.01 to −0.18, p = 0.019) and DA (SMD = −1.12, 95% CI: −1.88 to −0.37, p = 0.003) were observed in patients with AD. No difference was found in the concentrations of EPI between the two groups (SMD = −0.74, 95% CI: −1.85 to 0.37, p = 0.189).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Overall, these findings are in line with the hypothesis that reduced NE and DA may be an important indicator for AD (Registration number CRD42018112816).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Biological systems are composed of countless interlocking feedback loops. Reactor control systems—such as Chi-Bio (https://chi.bio/), recently published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt;—enable biologists to drive multiple processes within living biological samples, using a single experimental framework. Consequently, the dynamic relationships between many biological variables can be explored simultaneously in situ. Similar multivariable experimental reactors are employed beyond biology in the study of active matter and non-equilibrium chemical reactions, in which physical systems are maintained far from equilibrium through the continuous introduction of energy or matter. Inexpensive state-of-the-art components enable open-source implementation of such multiparameter architectures, which represent a move away from expensive systems optimised for single measurements, towards affordable and reconfigurable multi-measurement systems. The transfer of well-understood engineering knowledge into the hands of biological and chemical specialists via open-source channels allows rapid cycles of experimental development and heralds a change in experimental capability that is driving increased theoretical and practical understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems across a wide range of scientific fields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uhGeh_uSlwI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Autoantibodies Blocking M3 Muscarinic Receptors Cause Postganglionic Cholinergic Dysautonomia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A 10‐year‐old girl presented with ileus, urinary retention, dry mouth, lack of tears, fixed dilated pupils, and diffuse anhidrosis 7 days after a febrile illness. We hypothesized that her syndrome was due to autoimmunity against muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking their activation. Using an indirect enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for all 5 muscarinic receptors (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), we identified in the patient's serum antibodies that selectively bound to M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. In vitro functional studies confirmed that these autoantibodies selectively blocked M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Thus, autoantibodies against M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acetylcholine receptors cause acute postganglionic cholinergic dysautonomia. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Surgical Outcomes Can Be Inferred Based on Structural Connectome Hubs: A Machine Learning Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medication‐resistant focal epilepsy in adults. Despite removal of medial temporal structures, more than one‐third of patients continue to have disabling seizures postoperatively. Seizure refractoriness implies that extramedial regions are capable of influencing the brain network and generating seizures. We tested whether abnormalities of structural network integration could be associated with surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presurgical magnetic resonance images from 121 patients with drug‐resistant TLE across 3 independent epilepsy centers were used to train feed‐forward neural network models based on tissue volume or graph‐theory measures from whole‐brain diffusion tensor imaging structural connectomes. An independent dataset of 47 patients with TLE from 3 other epilepsy centers was used to assess the predictive values of each model and regional anatomical contributions toward surgical treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve based on regional betweenness centrality was 0.88, significantly higher than a random model or models based on gray matter volumes, degree, strength, and clustering coefficient. Nodes most strongly contributing to the predictive models involved the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, as well as the superior temporal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network integration in the medial and lateral temporal regions was related to surgical outcomes. Patients with abnormally integrated structural network nodes were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. These findings are in line with previous observations related to network abnormalities in TLE and expand on the notion of underlying aberrant plasticity. Our findings provide additional information on the mechanisms of surgical refractoriness. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neurochemical phenotype of growth hormone‐responsive cells in the mouse paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c728ff9a-6713-40fb-8f47-5a94aec5172f/cne25017-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of nonneuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Whole‐brain efferent and afferent connectivity of mouse ventral tegmental area melanocortin‐3 receptor neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Whole‐brain efferent and afferent connectivity of mouse ventral tegmental area melanocortin‐3 receptor neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c61725ba-b94d-4e62-b687-ee4708049ca8/cne25013-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.
VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.
Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Retina‐specific targeting of pericytes reveals structural diversity and enables control of capillary blood flow</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retina‐specific targeting of pericytes reveals structural diversity and enables control of capillary blood flow&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/70a367bb-d1a6-4cc2-a5f4-c918eb5953e6/cne25011-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivanova et al., use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, and Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Episodic Memories: How do the Hippocampus and the Entorhinal Ring Attractors Cooperate to Create Them?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559186</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559186</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is capable of registering a constellation of events, encountered only once, as an episodic memory that can last for a lifetime. As evidenced by the clinical case of the patient HM, memories preserving their episodic nature still depend on the hippocampal formation, several years after being created, while semantic memories are thought to reside in neocortical areas. The neurobiological substrate of one-time learning and life-long storing in the brain, that must exist at the cellular and circuit level, is still undiscovered. The breakthrough is delayed by the fact that studies jointly investigating the rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are mostly targeted at understanding the spatial aspect of learning. Here, we present the concept of an entorhinal cortical module, termed EPISODE module, that could explain how the representations of different elements constituting episodic memories can be linked together at the stage of encoding. The new model that we propose here reconciles the structural and functional observations made in the entorhinal cortex and explains how the downstream hippocampal processing organizes the representations into meaningful sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Early-Occurring Dendritic Spines Alterations in Mouse Models of Alzheimer’s Disease Inform on Primary Causes of Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The consensus that synaptic failure is the earliest cause of cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has initially led to investigate structural (dendritic spines) and physiological (LTP) synaptic dysfunctions in mouse models of AD with established cognitive alterations. The challenge is now to track down ultra-early alterations in spines to uncover causes rather than disease’s symptoms. This review article pinpoints dysregulations of the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein network which alter the morphology and function of spines in pre- and early- symptomatic hAPP mouse models of AD, and, hence, inform on primary causes of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Role of Copper in Tau-Related Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;All tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are characterized by the intracellular accumulation of abnormal forms of tau protein in neurons and glial cells, which negatively affect microtubule stability. Under physiological conditions, tubulin-associated unit (Tau) protein is intrinsically disordered, almost without secondary structure, and is not prone to aggregation. In AD, it assembles, and forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) that further build-up neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Aggregates are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that is more prone to aggregation. The pathology of AD is also linked to disturbed copper homeostasis, which promotes oxidative stress (OS). Copper imbalance is widely observed in AD patients. Deregulated copper ions may initiate and exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of β-sheet-rich tau fibrils that ultimately contribute to synaptic failure, neuronal death, and cognitive decline observed in AD patients. The present review summarizes factors affecting the process of tau aggregation, conformational changes of small peptide sequences in the microtubule-binding domain required for these motifs to act as seeding sites in aggregation, and the role of copper in OS induction, tau hyperphosphorylation and tau assembly. A better understanding of the various factors that affect tau aggregation under OS conditions may reveal new targets and novel pharmacological approaches for the therapy of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Overexpression of GSK-3β in Adult Tet-OFF GSK-3β Transgenic Mice, and Not During Embryonic or Postnatal Development, Induces Tau Phosphorylation, Neurodegeneration and Learning Deficits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.561470</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GSK-3β or tau-kinase I is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), playing a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accordingly, transgenic mouse models overexpressing this kinase recapitulate some aspects of this disease, such as tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death, and microgliosis. These alterations have been studied in mouse models showing GSK-3β overexpression from birth. In this case, some of these alterations may be due to adaptations that occur during development. Here we explored the potential of the Tet-OFF conditional system in the murine CamKIIα-tTA/GSK-3β model to increase the activity of GSK-3β only during adulthood. To this end, the overexpression of GSK-3β remained OFF during embryonic and postnatal development by administration of doxycycline in drinking water for 6 months, while it was turned ON in adult animals by removal of the treatment for 6 months. In these conditions, the CamKIIα-tTA/GSK-3β mouse is characterized by an increase in phosphorylated tau, cell death, and microgliosis. Furthermore, the increase in GSK-3β expression in the adult animals triggered a cognitive deficit, as determined through the hippocampus-dependent object recognition test (OR). These results demonstrate that the GSK-3β plays a key role in AD and that previously published data with other transgenic models are neither caused by or a consequence of adaptations to high levels of the enzyme during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Regulates Striatal Medium Spiny Neuron Synapse Density and Dendritic Spine Morphology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00161</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00161</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that mediates the transport, stability, and translation of hundreds of brain RNAs, is critically involved in regulating synaptic function. Loss of FMRP, as in fragile X syndrome (FXS), is a leading monogenic cause of autism and results in altered structural and functional synaptic plasticity, widely described in the hippocampus and cortex. Though FXS is associated with hyperactivity, impaired social interaction, and the development of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors, all of which are influenced by striatal activity, few studies have investigated the function of FMRP here. Utilizing a cortical-striatal co-culture model, we find that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) lacking FMRP fail to make normal increases in PSD95 expression over a short time period and have significant deficits in dendritic spine density and colocalized synaptic puncta at the later measured time point compared to wildtype (WT) MSNs. Acute expression of wtFMRP plasmid in Fmr1 KO co-cultures results in contrasting outcomes for these measures on MSNs at the more mature time point, reducing spine density across multiple spine types but making no significant changes in colocalized puncta. FMRP’s KH2 and RGG RNA-binding domains are required for normal elimination of PSD95, and interruption of these domains slightly favors elimination of immature spine types. Further, KH2 is required for normal levels of colocalized puncta. Our data are largely consistent with a basal role for FMRP and its RNA-binding domains in striatal synapse stabilization on developing MSNs, and in light of previous findings, suggest distinct regional and/or cell type-specific roles for FMRP in regulating synapse structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transcriptome of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species is increasingly focused in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. NcRNAs comprise, among others, transfer RNAs, long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs (miRs), each with their own specific biological function. We used smallRNASeq to assess miR expression in the hippocampus of young (3 month old) and aged (8 month old) Tg4-42 mice, a model system for sporadic AD, as well as age-matched wildtype controls. Tg4-42 mice express N-truncated Aβ&lt;sub&gt;4–42&lt;/sub&gt;, develop age-related neuron loss, reduced neurogenesis and behavioral deficits. Our results do not only confirm known miR-AD associations in Tg4-42 mice, but more importantly pinpoint 22 additional miRs associated to the disease. Twenty-five miRs were differentially expressed in both aged Tg4-42 and aged wildtype mice while eight miRs were differentially expressed only in aged wildtype mice, and 33 only in aged Tg4-42 mice. No significant alteration in the miRNome was detected in young mice, which indicates that the changes observed in aged mice are down-stream effects of Aβ-induced pathology in the Tg4-42 mouse model for AD. Targets of those miRs were predicted using miRWalk. For miRs that were differentially expressed only in the Tg4-42 model, 128 targets could be identified, whereas 18 genes were targeted by miRs only differentially expressed in wildtype mice and 85 genes were targeted by miRs differentially expressed in both mouse models. Genes targeted by differentially expressed miRs in the Tg4-42 model were enriched for negative regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation, learning or memory, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling and modulation of chemical synaptic transmission obtained. This untargeted miR sequencing approach supports previous reports on the Tg4-42 mice as a valuable model for AD. Furthermore, it revealed miRs involved in AD, which can serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: From Coarse to Fine-Grained Parcellation of the Cortical Surface Using a Fiber-Bundle Atlas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00032</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00032</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we present a hybrid method to create fine-grained parcellations of the cortical surface, from a coarse-grained parcellation according to an anatomical atlas, based on cortico-cortical connectivity. The connectivity information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography. Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can provide a good representation of the human brain connectome since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical parcellation. A parcellation algorithm is then performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, which is reproducible across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the analysis, the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, is considered and represented with a graph. One of our parcellations, an atlas composed of 160 parcels, achieves a reproducibility across subjects of ≈0.74, based on the average Dice's coefficient between subject's connectivity matrices, rather than ≈0.73 obtained for a macro anatomical parcellation of 150 parcels. Moreover, we compared two of our parcellations with state-of-the-art atlases, finding a degree of similarity with dMRI, functional, anatomical, and multi-modal atlases. The higher similarity was found for our parcellation composed of 185 sub-parcels with another parcellation based on dMRI data from the same database, but created with a different approach, leading to 130 parcels in common based on a Dice's coefficient ≥0.5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tracking Changes in Frontal Lobe Hemodynamic Response in Individual Adults With Developmental Language Disorder Following HD tDCS Enhanced Phonological Working Memory Training: An fNIRS Feasibility Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00362</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00362</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Current research suggests a neurobiological marker of developmental language disorder (DLD) in adolescents and young adults may be an atypical neural profile coupled with behavioral performance that overlaps with that of normal controls. Although many imaging techniques are not suitable for the study of speech and language processing in DLD populations, fNIRS may be a viable option. In this study we asked if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical cortical activation patterns in individual adults with DLD and track potential changes in cortical activation patterns following a phonological working memory training protocol enhanced with anodal HD tDCS stimulation to the presupplementary motor area (preSMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical hemodynamic responses in individual young adults with DLD during active spoken word processing and, (2) to determine if fNIRS can detect changes in hemodynamic response in these same adults with DLD following anodal HD tDCS enhanced phonological working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two adult subjects with DLD (female, age 25) completed a total of two sessions of fNIRs working memory task prior to and following one session of a non-word repetition task paired with anodal HD tDCS (1.0 mA tDCS; 20 min) to the preSMA. Standardized z-scores of behavioral measures (accuracy and reaction time) and changes in hemodynamic response during an n-back working memory task for the two participants with DLD was compared to that of a normative sample of 21 age- and gender- matched normal controls (ages 18 to 25) prior to and following phonological working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Individual standardized z-scores for each participant with DLD indicated that prior to training, hemoglobin response in the prefrontal lobe for both participants was markedly different from each other and normal controls. Following training, standard scores showed that the hemodynamic response for both participants moved within normal limits for ROIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings highlight the feasibility of fNIRS to establish individual differences in the link between behavior and neural patterns in single subjects with DLD, as well as track individual differences in changes in brain activity following working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Vital Signs Detect Cognitive Improvements During Combined Physical Therapy and Neuromodulation in Rehabilitation From Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00347</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00347</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using a longitudinal case study design, we have tracked the recovery of motor function following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal neuroimaging approach. In 2006, Canadian Soldier Captain (retired) Trevor Greene (TG) was attacked with an axe to the head while on tour in Afghanistan. TG continues intensive daily rehabilitation, which recently included the integration of physical therapy (PT) with neuromodulation using translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) to facilitate neuroplasticity. Recent findings with PT + TLNS demonstrated that recovery of motor function occurred beyond conventional time limits, currently extending past 14-years post-injury. To investigate whether PT + TLNS similarly resulted in associated cognitive function improvements, we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) with the brain vital signs framework. In parallel with motor function improvements, brain vital signs detected significant increases in basic attention (as measured by P300 response amplitude) and cognitive processing (as measured by contextual N400 response amplitude). These objective cognitive improvements corresponded with TG’s self-reported improvements, including a noteworthy and consistent reduction in ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The findings provide valuable insight into the potential importance of non-invasive neuromodulation in cognitive rehabilitation, in addition to initial indications for physical rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Degeneracy and Complexity in Neuro-Behavioral Correlates of Team Coordination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Team coordination—members of a group acting together rather than performing specific actions individually—is essential for success in many real-world tasks such as military missions, sports, workplace, or school interactions. However, team coordination is highly variable, which is one reason why its underlying neural processes are largely unknown. Here we used dual electroencephalography (EEG) in dyads to study the neurobehavioral dynamics of team coordination in an ecologically valid task that places intensive demands on joint performance. We present a novel conceptual framework to interpret neurobehavioral variability in terms of degeneracy, a fundamental property of complex biological systems said to enhance flexibility and robustness. We characterize degeneracy conceptually in terms of a manifold representing the geometric locus of the dynamics in the high dimensional state-space of neurobehavioral signals. The geometry and dimensionality of the manifold are determined by task constraints and team coordination requirements which restrict the manifold to trajectories that are conducive to successful task performance. Our results indicate that team coordination is associated with dimensionality reduction of the manifold as evident in increased inter-brain phase coherence of beta and gamma rhythms during critical phases of task performance where subjects exchange information. Team coordination was also found to affect the shape of the manifold manifested as a symmetry breaking of centro-parietal wavelet power patterns across subjects in trials with high team coordination. These results open a conceptual and empirical path to identifying the mechanisms underlying team performance in complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Assessing the Impact of Ih Conductance on Cross-Frequency Coupling in Model Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00081</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons are elements of neuronal circuitry that have been implicated in cross-frequency coupling (CFC) during cognitive tasks. We investigate potential mechanisms for CFC within these neurons by examining the role that the hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) plays in modulating CFC characteristics in multicompartment neuronal models. We quantify CFC along the soma-apical dendrite axis and tuft of three models configured to have different spatial distributions of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density: (1) exponential gradient along the soma-apical dendrite axis, (2) uniform distribution, and (3) no I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance. We simulated two current injection scenarios: distal apical 4 Hz modulation and perisomatic 4 Hz modulation, each with perisomatic, mid-apical, and distal apical 40 Hz injections. We used two metrics to quantify CFC strength—modulation index and height ratio—and we analyzed CFC phase properties. For all models, CFC was strongest in distal apical regions when the 40 Hz injection occurred near the soma and the 4 Hz modulation occurred in distal apical dendrite. The strongest CFC values were observed in the model with uniformly distributed I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density, but when the exponential gradient in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density was added, CFC strength decreased by almost 50%. When I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; was in the model, regions with much larger membrane potential fluctuations at 4 Hz than at 40 Hz had stronger CFC. Excluding the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance from the model resulted in CFC either reduced or comparable in strength relative to the model with the exponential gradient in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance. The I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance also imposed order on the phase characteristics of CFC such that minimum (maximum) amplitude 40 Hz membrane potential oscillations occurred during I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance deactivation (activation). On the other hand, when there was no I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance, phase relationships between minimum and maximum 40 Hz oscillation often inverted and occurred much closer together. This analysis can help experimentalists discriminate between CFC that originates from different underlying physiological mechanisms and can help illuminate the reasons why there are differences between CFC strength observed in different regions of the brain and between different populations of neurons based on the configuration of the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Kinematic Changes in a Mouse Model of Penetrating Hippocampal Injury and Their Recovery After Intranasal Administration of Endometrial Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Locomotion speed changes appear following hippocampal injury. We used a hippocampal penetrating brain injury mouse model to analyze other kinematic changes. We found a significant decrease in locomotion speed in both open-field and tunnel walk tests. We described a new quantitative method that allows us to analyze and compare the displacement curves between mice steps. In the tunnel walk, we marked mice with indelible ink on the knee, ankle, and metatarsus of the left and right hindlimbs to evaluate both in every step. Animals with hippocampal damage exhibit slower locomotion speed in both hindlimbs. In contrast, in the cortical injured group, we observed significant speed decrease only in the right hindlimb. We found changes in the displacement patterns after hippocampal injury. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles had been used for the treatment of several diseases in animal models. Here, we evaluated the effects of intranasal administration of endometrial mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles on the outcome after the hippocampal injury. We report the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 6 in these vesicles. We observed locomotion speed and displacement pattern preservation in mice after vesicle treatment. These mice had lower pyknotic cells percentage and a smaller damaged area in comparison with the nontreated group, probably due to angiogenesis, wound repair, and inflammation decrease. Our results build up on the evidence of the hippocampal role in walk control and suggest that the extracellular vesicles could confer neuroprotection to the damaged hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Comparison of CRISPR/Cas Endonucleases for in vivo Retinal Gene Editing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CRISPR/Cas has opened the prospect of direct gene correction therapy for some inherited retinal diseases. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery to retinal cells in vivo; however, with the expanding repertoire of CRISPR/Cas endonucleases, it is not clear which of these are most efficacious for retinal editing in vivo. We sought to compare CRISPR/Cas endonuclease activity using both single and dual AAV delivery strategies for gene editing in retinal cells. Plasmids of a dual vector system with SpCas9, SaCas9, Cas12a, CjCas9 and a sgRNA targeting YFP, as well as a single vector system with SaCas9/YFP sgRNA were generated and validated in YFP-expressing HEK293A cell by flow cytometry and the T7E1 assay. Paired CRISPR/Cas endonuclease and its best performing sgRNA was then packaged into an AAV2 capsid derivative, AAV7m8, and injected intravitreally into CMV-Cre:Rosa26-YFP mice. SpCas9 and Cas12a achieved better knockout efficiency than SaCas9 and CjCas9. Moreover, no significant difference in YFP gene editing was found between single and dual CRISPR/SaCas9 vector systems. With a marked reduction of YFP-positive retinal cells, AAV7m8 delivered SpCas9 was found to have the highest knockout efficacy among all investigated endonucleases. We demonstrate that the AAV7m8-mediated delivery of CRISPR/SpCas9 construct achieves the most efficient gene modification in neurosensory retinal cells in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Critical periods of brain development are epochs of heightened plasticity driven by environmental influence necessary for normal brain function. Recent studies are beginning to shed light on the possibility that timely interventions during critical periods hold potential to reorient abnormal developmental trajectories in animal models of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we re-examine the criteria defining critical periods, highlighting the recently discovered mechanisms of developmental plasticity in health and disease. In addition, we touch upon technological improvements for modeling critical periods in human-derived neural networks in vitro. These scientific advances associated with the use of developmental manipulations in the immature brain of animal models are the basic preclinical systems that will allow the future translatability of timely interventions into clinical applications for neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: PHF-Core Tau as the Potential Initiating Event for Tau Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00247</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among the elderly worldwide. Clinically, AD is characterized by impaired memory accompanied by other deficiencies in the cognitive domain. Neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are histopathological lesions that define brains with AD. NFTs consist of abundant intracellular paired helical filaments (PHFs) whose main constituent is tau protein. Tau undergoes posttranslational changes including hyperphosphorylation and truncation, both of which favor conformational changes in the protein. The sequential pathological processing of tau is illustrated with the following specific markers: pT231, TG3, AT8, AT100, and Alz50. Two proteolysis sites for tau have been described—truncation at glutamate 391 and at aspartate 421—and which can be demonstrated by reactivity with the antibodies 423 and TauC-3, respectively. In this review, we describe the molecular changes in tau protein as pre-NFTs progress to extracellular NFTs and during which the formation of a minimal nucleus of the filament, as the PHF core, occurs. We also analyzed the PHF core as the initiator of PHFs and tau phosphorylation as a protective neuronal mechanism against the assembly of the PHF core.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Limitations and Promise of Retinal Tissue From Human Pluripotent Stem Cells for Developing Therapies of Blindness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00179</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00179</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The self-formation of retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells generated a tremendous promise for developing new therapies of retinal degenerative diseases, which previously seemed unattainable. Together with use of induced pluripotent stem cells or/and CRISPR-based recombineering the retinal organoid technology provided an avenue for developing models of human retinal degenerative diseases “in a dish” for studying the pathology, delineating the mechanisms and also establishing a platform for large-scale drug screening. At the same time, retinal organoids, highly resembling developing human fetal retinal tissue, are viewed as source of multipotential retinal progenitors, young photoreceptors and just the whole retinal tissue, which may be transplanted into the subretinal space with a goal of replacing patient’s degenerated retina with a new retinal “patch.” Both approaches (transplantation and modeling/drug screening) were projected when Yoshiki Sasai demonstrated the feasibility of deriving mammalian retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells, and generated a lot of excitement. With further work and testing of both approaches in vitro and in vivo, a major implicit limitation has become apparent pretty quickly: the absence of the uniform layer of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells, which is normally present in mammalian retina, surrounds photoreceptor layer and develops and matures first. The RPE layer polarize into apical and basal sides during development and establish microvilli on the apical side, interacting with photoreceptors, nurturing photoreceptor outer segments and participating in the visual cycle by recycling 11-trans retinal (bleached pigment) back to 11-cis retinal. Retinal organoids, however, either do not have RPE layer or carry patches of RPE mostly on one side, thus directly exposing most photoreceptors in the developing organoids to neural medium. Recreation of the critical retinal niche between the apical RPE and photoreceptors, where many retinal disease mechanisms originate, is so far unattainable, imposes clear limitations on both modeling/drug screening and transplantation approaches and is a focus of investigation in many labs. Here we dissect different retinal degenerative diseases and analyze how and where retinal organoid technology can contribute the most to developing therapies even with a current limitation and absence of long and functional outer segments, supported by RPE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Downregulation of TrkC Receptors Increases Dendritic Arborization of Purkinje Cells in the Developing Cerebellum of the Opossum, Monodelphis domestica</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In therian mammals, the cerebellum is one of the late developing structures in the brain. Specifically, the proliferation of cerebellar granule cells occurs after birth, and even in humans, the generation of these cells continues during the first year of life. The main difference between marsupials and eutherians is that the majority of the brain structures in marsupials develop after birth. Herein, we report that in the newborn laboratory opossum (Monodelphis domestica), the cerebellar primordium is distinguishable in Nissl-stained sections. Additionally, bromodeoxyuridine birthdating experiments revealed that the first neurons form the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and Purkinje cells, and are generated within postnatal days (P) 1 and 5. Three weeks after birth, progenitors of granule cells in the external germinal layer (EGL) proliferate, producing granule cells. These progenitor cells persist for a long time, approximately 5 months. Furthermore, to study the effects of neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) during cerebellar development, cells were obtained from P3 opossums and cultured for 8 days. We found that TrkC downregulation stimulates dendritic branching of Purkinje neurons, which was surprising. The number of dendritic branches was higher in Purkinje cells transfected with the shRNA TrkC plasmid. However, there was no morphological change in the number of dendritic branches of granule cells transfected with either control or shRNA TrkC plasmids. We suggest that inhibition of TrkC activity enables NT3 binding to the neurotrophic receptor p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; that promotes dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells. This effect of TrkC receptors on dendritic branching is cell type specific, which could be explained by the strong expression of TrkC in Purkinje cells but not in granule cells. The data indicate a new role for TrkC receptors in Monodelphis opossum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Analyses Mutations in GSN, CST3, TTR, and ITM2B Genes in Chinese Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein deposition is a common mechanism of hereditary amyloidosis (HA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mutations of gelsolin (GSN), cystatin C (CST3), transthyretin (TTR), and integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B) genes can lead to HA. But the relationship is unclear between these genes and AD. Genes targeted sequencing (GTS), including GSN, CST3, TTR, and ITM2B, was performed in a total of 636 patients with clinical AD and 365 normal controls from China. As a result, according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, two novel likely pathogenic frame-shift mutations (GSN:c.1036delA:p.K346fs and GSN:c.8_35del:p.P3fs) were detected in five patients with AD, whose initial symptom was memory decline, accompanied with psychological and behavioral abnormalities later. Interestingly, the patient with K346fs mutation, presented cerebral β-amyloid protein deposition, had an early onset (48 years) and experienced rapid progression, while the other four patients with P3fs mutation had a late onset [(Mean ± SD): 69.50 ± 5.20 years] and a long course of illness [(Mean ± SD): 9.24 ± 4.86 years]. Besides, we also discovered 17 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in these four genes. To our knowledge, we are the first to report AD phenotype with GSN mutations in patients with AD in the Chinese cohort. Although mutations in the GSN gene are rare, it may explain a small portion of clinically diagnosed AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can map cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes such as tissue development and regeneration. Many trajectory inference methods have been developed to order cells by their progression through a dynamic process. However, when time series data is available, most of these methods do not consider the available time information when ordering cells and are instead designed to work only on a single scRNA-seq data snapshot. We present Tempora, a novel cell trajectory inference method that orders cells using time information from time-series scRNA-seq data. In performance comparison tests, Tempora inferred known developmental lineages from three diverse tissue development time series data sets, beating state of the art methods in accuracy and speed. Tempora works at the level of cell clusters (types) and uses biological pathway information to help identify cell type relationships. This approach increases gene expression signal from single cells, processing speed, and interpretability of the inferred trajectory. Our results demonstrate the utility of a combination of time and pathway information to supervise trajectory inference for scRNA-seq based analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GfF2CqpX5cA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Learning and generalization in spatial domains is often thought to rely on a “cognitive map”, representing relationships between spatial locations. Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more abstract, conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains. Yet both behavioral and model-based analyses suggest domain specific differences in how these representations map onto actions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6jq1i9COfCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), a subset of chronic active white matter lesions are identifiable on magnetic resonance imaging by their paramagnetic rims, and increasing evidence supports their association with severity of clinical disease. We studied their potential role in differential diagnosis, screening an international multicenter clinical research‐based sample of 438 individuals affected by different neurological conditions (MS, other inflammatory, infectious, and non‐inflammatory conditions). Paramagnetic rim lesions, rare in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS. Future prospective multicenter studies should validate their role as a diagnostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Postnatal development of the SMI‐32 labeling in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of kittens aged 0‐123 postnatal days, and in adults (Ad). Left – a representational examples of the SMI‐32 labeling, in kittens aged 0 days, 10 days, and in adult. Right – a number of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons in layers A, A1, and Cm of the LGNd. Different phases of the postnatal development (eyes opening, precritical period, critical period maximum) are marked by colors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulation of the heavy‐chain neurofilaments reflects the maturation status of neuronal structures. The spatial distribution and postnatal developmental dynamic of neurons expressing non‐phosphorylated heavy‐chain neurofilaments (labeled by SMI‐32 antibody) were analysed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of the cat. Both interlaminar and intralaminar differences in the dynamic of SMI‐32 staining were observed. The following results were obtained: (1) Ascending dorsoventral gradient in the density of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons (the greatest neuronal density in layer Cm, the minor in the top sublayer of layer A). This gradient was most prominent at the earliest stages of postnatal development (1st‐2nd weeks) and slowly flattened up to adulthood; (2) Layer A1 exhibits increases in SMI‐32‐positive cells earlier than layer A; (3) The general transient increment in the number and density of SMI‐32(+) neurons around 2‐5 postnatal weeks. Since SMI‐32 antibody is considered to be a putative marker for Y cells forming a motion processing stream, we suggest that peculiarities of SMI‐32 staining at geniculate level could reflect the heterogeneity of Y cell subpopulations and the heterochrony of their postnatal maturation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex‐specific association between infant caudate volumes and a polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific association between infant caudate volumes and a polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b1d93b6-1d81-43f9-a833-211890c179e2/jnr24722-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with sex‐specific brain structural alterations in the infant bilateral caudate which is crucially implicated in MDD in adults. Our results suggest that sex‐specific polygenic influences on early caudate volume development might contribute to the sexually dimorphic prevalence of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (PRS‐MDD) have been identified in large genome‐wide association studies, and recent findings suggest that PRS‐MDD might interact with environmental risk factors to shape human limbic brain development as early as in the prenatal period. Striatal structures are crucially involved in depression; however, the association of PRS‐MDD with infant striatal volumes is yet unknown. In this study, 105 Finnish mother–infant dyads (44 female, 11–54 days old) were investigated to reveal how infant PRS‐MDD is associated with infant dorsal striatal volumes (caudate, putamen) and whether PRS‐MDD interacts with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, gestational weeks 14, 24, 34) on infant striatal volumes. A robust sex‐specific main effect of PRS‐MDD on bilateral infant caudate volumes was observed. PRS‐MDD were more positively associated with caudate volumes in boys compared to girls. No significant interaction effects of genotype PRS‐MDD with the environmental risk factor “prenatal maternal depressive symptoms” (genotype‐by‐environment interaction) nor significant interaction effects of genotype with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and sex (genotype‐by‐environment‐by‐sex interaction) were found for infant dorsal striatal volumes. Our study showed that a higher PRS‐MDD irrespective of prenatal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is associated with smaller bilateral caudate volumes, an indicator of greater susceptibility to major depressive disorder, in female compared to male infants. This sex‐specific polygenic effect might lay the ground for the higher prevalence of depression in women compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Capturing Multiple Timescales of Adaptation to Second-Order Statistics With Generalized Linear Models: Gain Scaling and Fractional Differentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00060</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00060</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Single neurons can dynamically change the gain of their spiking responses to take into account shifts in stimulus variance. Moreover, gain adaptation can occur across multiple timescales. Here, we examine the ability of a simple statistical model of spike trains, the generalized linear model (GLM), to account for these adaptive effects. The GLM describes spiking as a Poisson process whose rate depends on a linear combination of the stimulus and recent spike history. The GLM successfully replicates gain scaling observed in Hodgkin-Huxley simulations of cortical neurons that occurs when the ratio of spike-generating potassium and sodium conductances approaches one. Gain scaling in the GLM depends on the length and shape of the spike history filter. Additionally, the GLM captures adaptation that occurs over multiple timescales as a fractional derivative of the stimulus envelope, which has been observed in neurons that include long timescale afterhyperpolarization conductances. Fractional differentiation in GLMs requires long spike history that span several seconds. Together, these results demonstrate that the GLM provides a tractable statistical approach for examining single-neuron adaptive computations in response to changes in stimulus variance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Inter- and Intra-subject Template-Based Multivariate Synchronization Index Using an Adaptive Threshold for SSVEP-Based BCIs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) has been widely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Many studies have proved that the Multivariate synchronization index (MSI) is an efficient method for recognizing the frequency components in SSVEP-based BCIs. Despite its success, the recognition accuracy has not been satisfactory because the simplified pre-constructed sine-cosine waves lack abundant features from the real electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Recent advances in addressing this issue have achieved a significant improvement in recognition accuracy by using individual calibration data. In this study, a new extension based on inter- and intra-subject template signals is introduced to improve the performance of the standard MSI method. Through template transfer, inter-subject similarity and variability are employed to enhance the robustness of SSVEP recognition. Additionally, most existed methods for SSVEP recognition utilize a fixed time window (TW) to perform frequency domain analysis, which limits the information transfer rate (ITR) of BCIs. For addressing this problem, a novel adaptive threshold strategy is integrated into the extension of MSI, which uses a dynamic window to extract the temporal features of SSVEPs and recognizes the stimulus frequency based on a pre-set threshold. The pre-set threshold contributes to obtaining an appropriate and shorter signal length for frequency recognition and filtering ignored-invalid trials. The proposed method is evaluated on a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects, and the result shows that this achieves higher recognition accuracy and information transfer rate when compared with the CCA, MSI, Multi-set CCA, and Individual Template-based CCA. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method is a promising approach for developing high-speed BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Influence of Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors on Task-Switching in Older Adults: An fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561877</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561877</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Not only are the effects of cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and low fitness on executive functions and brain activations in older adults scarcely investigated, no fMRI study has investigated the combined effects of multiple risk factors on brain activations in older adults. This fMRI study examined the independent and combined effects of two cardiovascular risk factors, arterial plasticity, and physical fitness, on brain activations during task-switching in older adults. The effects of these two risk factors on age-related differences in activation between older and younger adults were also examined. Independently, low physical fitness and low arterial plasticity were related to reduced suppressions of occipital brain regions. The combined effects of these two risks on occipital regions were greater than the independent effects of either risk factor. Age-related overactivations in frontal cortex were observed in low fitness older adults. Brain-behavior correlation indicates that these frontal overactivations are maladaptive to older adults’ task performance. It is possible that the resulting effects of cardiovascular risks on the aging brain, especially the maladaptive overactivations of frontal brain regions by high risk older adults, contribute to often found posterior-anterior shift in aging (PASA) brain activations. Furthermore, observed age-related differences in brain activations during task-switching can be partially attributed to individual differences in cardiovascular risks among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Influence of the Stimulus Design on the Harmonic Components of the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00343</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00343</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) are commonly used for functional objective diagnostics. In general, the main response at the stimulation frequency is used. However, some studies reported the main response at the second harmonic of the stimulation frequency. The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of the stimulus design on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. We studied 22 subjects (8 males, mean age ± SD = 27 ± 4.8 years) using a circular layout (r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0–1.6°, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6–3.5°, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.5–6.4°, r&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.4–10.9°, and r&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.9–18°). At a given eccentricity, the stimulus was presented according to a 7.5 Hz square wave with 50% duty cycle. To analyze the influence of the stimulus eccentricity, a background luminance of 30 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was added to suppress foveal stray light effects; to analyze the influence of simultaneous foveal and peripheral stimulations, stimulations are performed without stray light suppression. For statistical analysis, medians M of the amplitude ratios for amplitudes at the second harmonic to the first harmonic and the probability of the occurrence of the main response at the second harmonic P(MCSH) are calculated. For stimulations with foveal stray light suppression, the medians were M&lt;sub&gt;0 –1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45, M&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45, M&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.76, M&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.72, and M&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.48, and the probabilities were P&lt;sub&gt;0–1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.32, P&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.29, and P&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.30. For stimulations without foveal stray light suppression, the medians M were M&lt;sub&gt;0 –1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.29, M&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.37, M&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.98, M&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9 ^^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.08, and M&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.24, and the probabilities were P&lt;sub&gt;0–1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.09, P&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.50, P&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.55, and P&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.55. In conclusion, the stimulus design has an influence on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. An increase in stimulation eccentricity during extrafoveal stimulation leads to a transition of the main response to the second harmonic. The effect is enhanced by a simultaneous foveal stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Generalized Linear Model of a Navigation Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00056</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation by mammals is believed to rely on a network of neurons in the hippocampal formation, which includes the hippocampus, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), and additional nearby regions. Neurons in these regions represent spatial information by tuning to the position, orientation, and speed of the animal in the form of head direction cells, speed cells, grid cells, border cells, and unclassified spatially modulated cells. While the properties of single cells are well studied, little is known about the functional structure of the network in the MEC. Here, we use a generalized linear model to study the network of spatially modulated cells in the MEC. We found connectivity patterns between all spatially encoding cells and not only grid cells. In addition, the neurons’ past activity contributed to the overall activity patterns. Finally, position-modulated cells and head direction cells differed in the dependence of the activity on the history. Our results indicate that MEC neurons form a local interacting network to support spatial information representations and suggest an explanation for their complex temporal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Chewing Efficiency, Global Cognitive Functioning, and Dentition: A Cross-sectional Observational Study in Older People With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild to Moderate Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00225</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00225</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Previous studies suggest an association between poor mastication and cognitive impairment. The role of chewing efficiency and dentition in this relation is unclear. The aim was to examine global cognitive functioning and dentition as predictors for chewing efficiency, in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this observational cross-sectional study, 136 people with MCI or dementia were included. The chewing efficiency was assessed with a two-colored chewing gum and analyzed with the Chewing Efficiency Analysis software. The level of global cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) by trained clinical staff. An oral examination was performed by a dentist and included the number of present teeth, the number of occluding pairs, and the presence of prostheses. Age, gender, and educational years were derived from the medical records. Univariate and multivariate backward stepwise linear regression analyses were used to evaluate global cognitive functioning and dentition as predictors for chewing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age of the participants was 82.1 (SD 5.8) years, and 74 (54.4%) were female. The participants had a median MMSE score of 22.4 (IQR 18.0–26.0) and a median Chewing Efficiency Analysis score of 0.46 (IQR 0.14–0.59). The median number of teeth was 13.0 (IQR 0.0–23.0), and the median number of occluding pairs was 0.0 (IQR 0.0–7.0). Sixty-four (47.4%) of the participants wore full prosthesis in the upper jaw. In univariate linear regression analyses, predictive factors for the Chewing Efficiency Analysis score were age, MMSE score, full prosthesis in the upper jaw, number of present teeth, and number of occluding pairs. In the multivariate model, full prosthesis in the upper jaw and number of occluding pairs were significant predictors for the Chewing Efficiency Analysis score. Participants with full prosthesis in the upper jaw had a lower Chewing Efficiency Analysis score than participants with natural dentition in the upper jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Better mastication is associated with a higher number of occluding pairs. Full prosthesis in the upper jaw is related to a lower chewing efficiency. Global cognitive functioning is not associated with mastication in older people with MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia. This might be explained by sufficient capacity for compensation of reduced mastication in this group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Xiong Wen, Adam J. Mead, Supat Thongjuea&lt;/p&gt;

We present VALERIE (Visualising alternative splicing events from single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing experiments), an R package for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution. To explore any given specified genomic region, corresponding to an alternative splicing event, VALERIE generates an ensemble of informative plots to visualise cell-to-cell heterogeneity of alternative splicing profiles across single cells and performs statistical tests to compare percent spliced-in (PSI) values across the user-defined groups of cells. Among the features available, VALERIE displays PSI values, in lieu of read coverage, which is more suitable for representing alternative splicing profiles for a large number of samples typically generated by single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments. VALERIE is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VALERIE/index.html.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pAUzcfXxr9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Detection and segmentation of morphologically complex eukaryotic cells in fluorescence microscopy images via feature pyramid fusion</title>

Detection and segmentation of macrophage cells in fluorescence microscopy images is a challenging problem, mainly due to crowded cells, variation in shapes, and morphological complexity. We present a new deep learning approach for cell detection and segmentation that incorporates previously learned nucleus features. A novel fusion of feature pyramids for nucleus detection and segmentation with feature pyramids for cell detection and segmentation is used to improve performance on a microscopic image dataset created by us and provided for public use, containing both nucleus and cell signals. Our experimental results indicate that cell detection and segmentation performance significantly benefit from the fusion of previously learned nucleus features. The proposed feature pyramid fusion architecture clearly outperforms a state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN approach for cell detection and segmentation with relative mean average precision improvements of up to 23.88% and 23.17%, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yEy1ii-hDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Learning to avoid harmful consequences can be a costly trial-and-error process. In such situations, social information can be leveraged to improve individual learning outcomes. Here, we investigated how participants used their own experiences and others’ social cues to avoid harm. Participants made repeated choices between harmful and safe options, each with different probabilities of generating shocks, while also seeing the image of a social partner. Some partners made predictive gaze cues towards the harmful choice option while others cued an option at random, and did so using neutral or fearful facial expressions. We tested how learned social information about partner reliability transferred across contexts by letting participants encounter the same partner in multiple trial blocks while facing novel choice options. Participants’ decisions were best explained by a reinforcement learning model that independently learned the probabilities of options being safe and of partners being reliable and combined these combined these estimates to generate choices. Advice from partners making a fearful facial expression influenced participants’ decisions more than advice from partners with neutral expressions. Our results showed that participants made better decisions when facing predictive partners and that they cached and transferred partner reliability estimates into new blocks. Using simulations we show that participants’ transfer of social information into novel contexts is better adapted to variable social environments where social partners may change their cuing strategy or become untrustworthy. Finally, we found no relation between autism questionnaire scores and performance in our task, but do find autism trait related differences in learning rate parameters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wfNEGcxtR64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Generalized estimating equation modeling on correlated microbiome sequencing data with longitudinal measures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Chen, Wei Xu&lt;/p&gt;

Existing models for assessing microbiome sequencing such as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can only test predictors’ effects on OTUs. There is limited work on how to estimate the correlations between multiple OTUs and incorporate such relationship into models to evaluate longitudinal OTU measures. We propose a novel approach to estimate OTU correlations based on their taxonomic structure, and apply such correlation structure in Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models to estimate both predictors’ effects and OTU correlations. We develop a two-part Microbiome Taxonomic Longitudinal Correlation (MTLC) model for multivariate zero-inflated OTU outcomes based on the GEE framework. In addition, longitudinal and other types of repeated OTU measures are integrated in the MTLC model. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the MTLC method. Compared with the existing methods, the MTLC method shows robust and consistent estimation, and improved statistical power for testing predictors’ effects. Lastly we demonstrate our proposed method by implementing it into a real human microbiome study to evaluate the obesity on twins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AiYetAL6ehI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Delay-period activity in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex tracks noise and biases in visual working memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000854</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Qing Yu, Matthew F. Panichello, Ying Cai, Bradley R. Postle, Timothy J. Buschman&lt;/p&gt;

Working memory is imprecise, and these imprecisions can be explained by the combined influences of random diffusive error and systematic drift toward a set of stable states (“attractors”). However, the neural correlates of diffusion and drift remain unknown. Here, we investigated how delay-period activity in frontal and parietal cortex, which is known to correlate with the decline in behavioral memory precision observed with increasing memory load, might relate to diffusion and drift. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. To quantify the influence of drift and diffusion, we modeled subjects’ behavior using a discrete attractor model and calculated within-subject correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and whole-trial estimates of drift and diffusion. We found that although increases in frontal and parietal activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison, a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift, rather than diffusion, explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex. These results are consistent with a model of the differential recruitment of general frontoparietal mechanisms in response to diffusive noise and of stimulus-specific biases in occipital cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/je9VB-_-tso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as &lt;i&gt;OAS1-3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IFIT1-3&lt;/i&gt; and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines &lt;i&gt;CXCL9/10/11&lt;/i&gt;, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including &lt;i&gt;ACE2&lt;/i&gt;, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell–specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines &lt;i&gt;CXCL9/10/11&lt;/i&gt; and their cognate receptor &lt;i&gt;CXCR3&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;CD8A&lt;/i&gt; and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell–specific and NK cell–specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H9Tm0EdCyZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Leiomodin creates a leaky cap at the pointed end of actin-thin filaments</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Dmitri Tolkatchev, Garry E. Smith Jr., Lauren E. Schultz, Mert Colpan, Gregory L. Helms, John R. Cort, Carol C. Gregorio, Alla S. Kostyukova&lt;/p&gt;

Improper lengths of actin-thin filaments are associated with altered contractile activity and lethal myopathies. Leiomodin, a member of the tropomodulin family of proteins, is critical in thin filament assembly and maintenance; however, its role is under dispute. Using nuclear magnetic resonance data and molecular dynamics simulations, we generated the first atomic structural model of the binding interface between the tropomyosin-binding site of cardiac leiomodin and the N-terminus of striated muscle tropomyosin. Our structural data indicate that the leiomodin/tropomyosin complex only forms at the pointed end of thin filaments, where the tropomyosin N-terminus is not blocked by an adjacent tropomyosin protomer. This discovery provides evidence supporting the debated mechanism where leiomodin and tropomodulin regulate thin filament lengths by competing for thin filament binding. Data from experiments performed in cardiomyocytes provide additional support for the competition model; specifically, expression of a leiomodin mutant that is unable to interact with tropomyosin fails to displace tropomodulin at thin filament pointed ends and fails to elongate thin filaments. Together with previous structural and biochemical data, we now propose a molecular mechanism of actin polymerization at the pointed end in the presence of bound leiomodin. In the proposed model, the N-terminal actin-binding site of leiomodin can act as a “swinging gate” allowing limited actin polymerization, thus making leiomodin a leaky pointed-end cap. Results presented in this work answer long-standing questions about the role of leiomodin in thin filament length regulation and maintenance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dMzzfXTBLHU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Selective enhancement of low-gamma activity by tACS improves phonemic processing and reading accuracy in dyslexia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Marchesotti, Johanna Nicolle, Isabelle Merlet, Luc H. Arnal, John P. Donoghue, Anne-Lise Giraud&lt;/p&gt;

The phonological deficit in dyslexia is associated with altered low-gamma oscillatory function in left auditory cortex, but a causal relationship between oscillatory function and phonemic processing has never been established. After confirming a deficit at 30 Hz with electroencephalography (EEG), we applied 20 minutes of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to transiently restore this activity in adults with dyslexia. The intervention significantly improved phonological processing and reading accuracy as measured immediately after tACS. The effect occurred selectively for a 30-Hz stimulation in the dyslexia group. Importantly, we observed that the focal intervention over the left auditory cortex also decreased 30-Hz activity in the right superior temporal cortex, resulting in reinstating a left dominance for the oscillatory response. These findings establish a causal role of neural oscillations in phonological processing and offer solid neurophysiological grounds for a potential correction of low-gamma anomalies and for alleviating the phonological deficit in dyslexia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dE3pBlrvRXY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Promotes Gait Training in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether priming with 1 or 25Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will enhance the benefits from treadmill training up to 3 months postintervention in people with Parkinson disease (PD), and to evaluate the underlying changes in cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted between October 2016 and December 2018. Fifty‐one participants with PD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of rTMS (25Hz, 1Hz, or sham) followed by treadmill training. All participants were assessed at baseline and 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months postintervention. Primary outcome was fastest walking speed, and secondary outcomes were timed up‐and‐go test (TUG), dual‐task TUG (DT‐TUG), motor section of the Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS‐III), and electrophysiological evaluation of cortical excitability by TMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups produced a greater improvement in fastest walking speed at 1 day and 3 months postintervention than the sham group. Only the 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups sustained the improvements in TUG, and had a significant improvement in DT‐TUG and MDS‐UPDRS‐III for up to 3 months. Behavioral improvements correlated with increased cortical silent period and short‐interval intracortical inhibition in both groups receiving real rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priming with 1 and 25Hz rTMS can augment the benefits of treadmill training and lead to long‐term motor improvement up to 3 months postintervention. The motor improvement at follow‐up was associated with a normalization of cortical excitability, which in turn suggests an alteration of the homeostatic plasticity range. Rebalancing cortical excitability by rTMS appears critical for plasticity induction. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ocular dominance plasticity: Molecular mechanisms revisited</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity. Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory. In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: (a) Are we testing ODP per se? (b) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? (c) The critical importance of binocular competition, (d) What is the adult plasticity? (e) Excitation–Inhibition balance in local circuits, and (f) Species differences in the animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Evolution of the speech‐ready brain: The voice/jaw connection in the human motor cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Evolution of the speech‐ready brain: The voice/jaw connection in the human motor cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/498baa0a-bb47-492e-a76b-4b49e0748e3c/cne24997-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are nonvocal in most nonhuman primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a highly developed synapse linking motor neuron activity with muscle contraction. A complex of molecular cascades together with the specialized NMJ architecture ensures that each action potential arriving at the motor nerve terminal is translated into an action potential in the muscle fiber. The muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a key molecular component located at the postsynaptic muscle membrane responsible for the generation of the endplate potential (EPP), which usually exceeds the threshold potential necessary to activate voltage-gated sodium channels and triggers a muscle action potential. Two AChR isoforms are found in mammalian muscle. The fetal isoform is present in prenatal stages and is involved in the development of the neuromuscular system whereas the adult isoform prevails thereafter, except after denervation when the fetal form is re-expressed throughout the muscle. This review will summarize the structural and functional differences between the two isoforms and outline congenital and autoimmune myasthenic syndromes that involve the isoform specific AChR subunits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a central component in signaling networks in a multitude of mammalian cell types. This review covers recent advances on specific functions of p38 MAP kinases in cells of the central nervous system. Unique and specific functions of the four mammalian p38 kinases are found in all major cell types in the brain. Mechanisms of p38 activation and downstream phosphorylation substrates in these different contexts are outlined and how they contribute to functions of p38 in physiological and under disease conditions. Results in different model organisms demonstrated that p38 kinases are involved in cognitive functions, including functions related to anxiety, addiction behavior, neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and decision making. Finally, the role of p38 kinases in psychiatric and neurological conditions and the current progress on therapeutic inhibitors targeting p38 kinases are covered and implicate p38 kinases in a multitude of CNS-related physiological and disease states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy approaches using viral vectors for the overexpression of target genes have been for several years the focus of gene therapy research against neurological disorders. These approaches deliver robust expression of therapeutic genes, but are typically limited to the delivery of single genes and often do not manipulate the expression of the endogenous locus. In the last years, the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized many areas of scientific research by providing novel tools that allow simple and efficient manipulation of endogenous genes. One of the applications of CRISPR-Cas9, termed CRISPRa, based on the use of a nuclease-null Cas9 protein (dCas9) fused to transcriptional activators, enables quick and efficient increase in target endogenous gene expression. CRISPRa approaches are varied, and different alternatives exist with regards to the type of Cas9 protein and transcriptional activator used. Several of these approaches have been successfully used in neurons in vitro and in vivo, but have not been so far extensively applied for the overexpression of genes involved in synaptic transmission. Here we describe the development and application of two different CRISPRa systems, based on single or dual Lentiviral and Adeno-Associated viral vectors and VP64 or VPR transcriptional activators, and demonstrate their efficiency in increasing mRNA and protein expression of the Cnr1 gene, coding for neuronal CB1 receptors. Both approaches were similarly efficient in primary neuronal cultures, and achieved a 2–5-fold increase in Cnr1 expression, but the AAV-based approach was more efficient in vivo. Our dual AAV-based VPR system in particular, based on Staphylococcus aureus dCas9, when injected in the hippocampus, displayed almost complete simultaneous expression of both vectors, high levels of dCas9 expression, and good efficiency in increasing Cnr1 mRNA as measured by in situ hybridization. In addition, we also show significant upregulation of CB1 receptor protein in vivo, which is reflected by an increased ability in reducing neurotransmitter release, as measured by electrophysiology. Our results show that CRISPRa techniques could be successfully used in neurons to target overexpression of genes involved in synaptic transmission, and can potentially represent a next-generation gene therapy approach against neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Expression Profile at the Motor Endplate of the Neuromuscular Junction of Fast-Twitch Muscle</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a prototypic chemical synapse between the spinal motor neuron and the motor endplate. Gene expression profiles of the motor endplate are not fully elucidated. Collagen Q (ColQ) is a collagenic tail subunit of asymmetric forms of acetylcholinesterase and is driven by two distinct promoters. pColQ1 is active throughout the slow-twitch muscle, whereas pColQ1a is active at the motor endplate of fast-twitch muscle. We made a transgenic mouse line that expresses nuclear localization signal (NLS)-attached Cre recombinase under the control of pColQ1a (pColQ1a-Cre mouse). RiboTag mouse expresses an HA-tagged ribosomal subunit, RPL22, in cells expressing Cre recombinase. We generated pColQ1a-Cre:RiboTag mouse, and confirmed that HA-tagged RPL22 was enriched at the NMJ of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Next, we confirmed that Chrne and Musk that are specifically expressed at the NMJ were indeed enriched in HA-immunoprecipitated (IP) RNA, whereas Sox10 and S100b, markers for Schwann cells, and Icam1, a marker for vascular endothelial cells, and Pax3, a marker for muscle satellite cells, were scarcely detected. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data showed that “phosphatidylinositol signaling system” and “extracellular matrix receptor interaction” were enriched at the motor endplate. Subsequent analysis revealed that genes encoding diacylglycerol kinases, phosphatidylinositol kinases, phospholipases, integrins, and laminins were enriched at the motor endplate. We first characterized the gene expression profile under translation at the motor endplate of TA muscle using the RiboTag technique. We expect that our gene expression profiling will help elucidate molecular mechanisms of the development, maintenance, and pathology of the NMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Olney extended these findings by showing that neuronal degeneration affected other brain structures including neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the area postrema, that the lesion spared axons passing through these areas, and that the neurotoxic potency of glutamate analogs correlated with their excitatory potency, resulting in the designation “excitotoxins.” As this method affected only a small number of brain regions, it was not suitable for targeted brain lesions. The Coyle laboratory showed that direct injection of the potent glutamate receptor agonist, kainic acid, into the rat striatum caused a rapid degeneration of intrinsic neurons while sparing axons of passage or termination including the unmyelinated dopaminergic terminals. Kainic acid also exhibited this perikaryal-specific and axon-sparing profile when injected into the cerebellum, hippocampus and eye. However, neuronal vulnerability was highly variable, with hippocampal CA3, pyriform cortex and amygdala neurons exhibiting great sensitivity due to kainate’s high convulsive activity. In a comparison study, ibotenic acid, a potent glutamatergic agonist isolated from the amanita muscaria mushroom, was found to have excitotoxic potency comparable to kainate but was far less epileptogenic. Ibotenate produced spherical, perikaryal-specific lesions regardless of the site of injection, and experiments with specific glutamate receptor antagonists showed that its effects were mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Because of this uniform neurotoxicity and near ubiquitous efficacy, ibotenic acid became the excitotoxic lesioning agent of choice. The discovery of the excitotoxic properties of the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid and of the anti-excitotoxic, neuroprotective effects of the related metabolite kynurenic acid in the Schwarcz laboratory then gave rise to the concept that these endogenous compounds may play causative roles in the neuropathology of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Upregulation of C Terminus of Hsc70-Interacting Protein Attenuates Apoptosis and Procoagulant Activity and Facilitates Brain Repair After Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) could highly induce coagulopathy through breaking the dynamic balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, which may be a major contributor to the progressive secondary injury cascade that occurs after TBI. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibition is reported to exert neuroprotection in TBI, making it a potential regulatory target involved in TBI-induced coagulation disorder. PTEN level is controlled in a major way by E3 ligase-mediated degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome system. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) has been shown to regulate proteasomal degradation and ubiquitination level of PTEN. In the present study, CHIP was overexpressed and knocked down in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) and tissues during the early phase of TBI. In vitro cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, migration capacity, and invasion capacity were determined. The changes of procoagulant and apoptosis molecules after TBI were also detected as well as the micrangium density and blood–brain barrier permeability after in vivo TBI. In vitro results demonstrated that CHIP overexpression facilitated bEnd.3 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and downregulated cell apoptosis and the expressions of procoagulant molecules through promoting PTEN ubiquitination in a simulated TBI model with stretch-induced injury treatment. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that CHIP overexpression suppressed post-TBI apoptosis and procoagulant protein expressions, as well as increased microvessel density, reduced hemorrhagic injury, and blood–brain barrier permeability. These findings suggested that the upregulation of CHIP may attenuate apoptosis and procoagulant activity, facilitate brain repair, and thus exerts neuroprotective effects in TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alzheimer’s Retinopathy: Seeing Disease in the Eyes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurosensory retina emerges as a prominent site of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. As a CNS extension of the brain, the neuro retina is easily accessible for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging. Studies have shown that along with cognitive decline, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD often suffer from visual impairments, abnormal electroretinogram patterns, and circadian rhythm disturbances that can, at least in part, be attributed to retinal damage. Over a decade ago, our group identified the main pathological hallmark of AD, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plaques, in the retina of patients including early-stage clinical cases. Subsequent histological, biochemical and in vivo retinal imaging studies in animal models and in humans corroborated these findings and further revealed other signs of AD neuropathology in the retina. Among these signs, hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal degeneration, retinal thinning, vascular abnormalities and gliosis were documented. Further, linear correlations between the severity of retinal and brain Aβ concentrations and plaque pathology were described. More recently, extensive retinal pericyte loss along with vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β deficiency were discovered in postmortem retinas of MCI and AD patients. This progressive loss was closely associated with increased retinal vascular amyloidosis and predicted cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores. These studies brought excitement to the field of retinal exploration in AD. Indeed, many questions still remain open, such as queries related to the temporal progression of AD-related pathology in the retina compared to the brain, the relations between retinal and cerebral changes and whether retinal signs can predict cognitive decline. The extent to which AD affects the retina, including the susceptibility of certain topographical regions and cell types, is currently under intense investigation. Advances in retinal amyloid imaging, hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography, and OCT-angiography encourage the use of such modalities to achieve more accurate, patient- and user-friendly, noninvasive detection and monitoring of AD. In this review, we summarize the current status in the field while addressing the many unknowns regarding Alzheimer’s retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Individual Baseline Performance and Electrode Montage Impact on the Effects of Anodal tDCS Over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00349</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00349</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC), can produce significant effects on working memory (WM) performance and associated neurophysiological activity. However, results from previous studies are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be attributed to methodological and individual differences during experiments. This study therefore investigated two hypotheses: (1) A multichannel-optimized montage was expected to be more effective than a classical bipolar montage, because of increased focality. (2) The subjects were expected to benefit differently from the stimulation depending on their initial task performance. In a sham-controlled crossover study, 24 healthy participants received bipolar, multichannel, and sham stimulation for 20 min in randomized order, targeting the lDLPFC while performing a 2-back WM task. After stimulation, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded at rest and during 2-back and nontarget continuous performance task (CPT) performance. Bipolar and multichannel stimulations were both well tolerated and effectively blinded. We found no effect of stimulation on behavioral performance or neuronal oscillations comparing the classical bipolar or multichannel montage with sham stimulation. We did, however, find an interaction between stimulation and initial task performance. For multichannel stimulation, initially low-performing participants tended to improve their WM performance while initially high-performing participants tended to worsen their performance compared to sham stimulation. Both tDCS montages induced changes in neural oscillatory power, which correlated with baseline performance. The worse the participants’ initial WM performance was, the more task-related theta power was induced by multichannel and bipolar stimulation. The same effect was observed for alpha power in the nontarget task following multichannel stimulation. Notably, we were not able to show a superiority of multichannel stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. Still, comparing both montages with sham stimulation, multichannel stimulation led to stronger effects than bipolar stimulation. The current study highlights the importance of investigating different parameters with potential influence on tDCS effects in combination. Our results demonstrate how individual differences in cognitive performance and electrode montages influence effects of tDCS on neuropsychological performance. These findings support the idea of an individualized and optimized stimulation setting, potentially leading to increased tDCS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using Communication to Modulate Neural Synchronization in Teams</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00332</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout training and team performance, teams may be assessed based on their communication patterns to identify which behaviors contributed to the team’s performance; however, this process of establishing meaning in communication is burdensome and time consuming despite the low monetary cost. A current topic in team research is developing covert measures, which are easier to analyze in real-time, to identify team processes as they occur during team performance; however, little is known about how overt and covert measures of team process relate to one another. In this study, we investigated the relationship between overt (communication) and covert (neural) measures of team process by manipulating the interaction partner (participant or experimenter) team members worked with and the type of task (decision-making or action-based) teams performed to assess their effects on team neural synchronization (measured as neurodynamic entropy) and communication (measured as both flow and content). The results indicated that the type of task affected how the teams structured their communication but had unpredictable effects on the neural synchronization of the team when averaged across the task session. The interaction partner did not affect team neural synchronization when averaged. However, there were significant relationships when communication and neural processes were examined over time between the neurodynamic entropy and the communication flow time series due to both the type of task and the interaction partner. Specifically, significant relationships across time were observed when participants were interacting with the other participant, during the second task trial, and across different regions of the cortex depending on the type of task being performed. The findings from the time series analyses suggest that factors that are previously known to affect communication (interaction partner and task type) also structure the relationship between team communication and neural synchronization—cross-level effects—but only when examined across time. Future research should consider these factors when developing new conceptualizations of team process measurement for measuring team performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Nicotine Gum Administration on Vision (ENIGMA-Vis): Study Protocol of a Double-Blind, Randomized, and Controlled Clinical Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00314</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies reported that tobacco addiction was related to visual impairments, but one unresolved issue is whether the impairments are related to the many compounds existing in the cigarettes or to the effects of nicotine. On the other hand, nicotine gum can be used as replacement therapy or as a neuroprotective agent for some diseases. The main purpose of this controlled trial is to investigate the effects of nicotine gum on vision. The ENIGMA-Vis trial aims to compare two dosages of nicotine gum (2 and 4 mg) and a placebo gum in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 participants to be allocated into a single group assignment of repeated measures (two studies; N = 50 for each one). Eligibility criteria are healthy non-smokers not diagnosed with substance abuse and without an acute or chronic medical condition. Intervention will last three sessions for each participant with a window frame of 1 week per session. Study outcomes are (1) short-term effects of nicotine gum on contrast sensitivity; (2) short-term effects of nicotine gum on chromatic contrast discrimination; and (3) whether demographics, body mass index, or serum cotinine predicts response of visual processing. This study addresses an important gap in the effects of nicotine on vision. One of the main takeaways of this study is to understand the effects of nicotine on contrast sensitivity and chromatic contrast discrimination. This information will provide a further understanding of how nicotine interacts with early visual processes and help determine how the different components present during smoking can affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration Number: RBR-46tjy3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Human iPSC Line Carrying a de novo Pathogenic FUS Mutation Identified in a Patient With Juvenile ALS Differentiated Into Motor Neurons With Pathological Characteristics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to establish patient-specific cell lines and are ideal models to mirror the pathological features of diseases and investigate their underlying mechanisms in vitro, especially for rare genic diseases. Here, a de novo mutation c.1509dupA (p.R503fs) in fused in sarcoma (FUS) was detected in a patient with sporadic juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). JALS is a rare and severe form of ALS with unclear pathogenesis and no effective cure. An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line carrying the de novo mutation was established, and it represents a good tool to study JALS pathogenesis and gene therapy strategies for the treatment of this condition. The established human iPSC line carrying the de novoFUS mutation strongly expressed pluripotency markers and could be differentiated into three embryonic germ layers with no gross chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, the iPSCs could be successfully differentiated into motor neurons exhibiting the pathological characteristics of ALS. Our results indicate that this line may be useful for uncovering the pathogenesis of sporadic JALS and screen for drugs to treat this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Morphological Responses of Excitatory Prelimbic and Orbitofrontal Cortical Neurons to Excess Corticosterone in Adolescence and Acute Stress in Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence indicates that chronic stress and excess glucocorticoids induce neuronal remodeling in prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions. Adolescence is also characterized by a structural reorganization of PFC neurons, yet interactions between stress- and age-related structural plasticity are still being determined. We quantified dendritic spine densities on apical dendrites of excitatory neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, prelimbic subregion (PL). Densities decreased across adolescent development, as expected, and spine volume increased. Unexpectedly, exposure to excess corticosterone (CORT) throughout adolescence did not cause additional dendritic spine loss detectable in adulthood. As a positive control dendrite population expected to be sensitive to CORT, we imaged neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), confirming CORT-induced dendritic spine attrition on basal arbors of layer V neurons. We next assessed the effects of acute, mild stress in adulthood: On PL neurons, an acute stressor increased the density of mature, mushroom-shaped spines. Meanwhile, on OFC neurons, dendritic spine volumes and lengths were lower in mice exposed to both CORT and an acute stressor (also referred to as a “double hit”). In sum, prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids during adolescence can have morphological and also metaplastic consequences, but they are not global. Anatomical considerations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Circulating Exosome microRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers of Dementia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a syndrome of acquired cognitive impairment that leads to a significant decline in a patient’s daily life, ability to learn, and the ability to communicate with others. Dementia occurs in many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). Although the analysis of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood physicochemical analysis can indicate neurological impairment, there are currently no sensitive biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis of dementia or for identifying the cause of dementia. Previous studies have suggested that circulating micro (mi)RNAs may be used as biomarkers for diagnosing neurological disorders. However, miRNAs are susceptible to interference by other components in the peripheral circulation, bringing into question the diagnostic value of circulating miRNAs. Exosomes secreted by most cell types contain proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs that are closely associated with changes in cellular functions. Exosome miRNAs (ex-miRNAs) are highly stable and resistant to degradation. Therefore, these may serve as useful biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis of dementia. Here, we review studies of ex-miRNAs that commonly cause clinical dementia and explore whether ex-miRNAs may be used as early diagnostic biomarkers of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Mood and anxiety disorders are complex heterogeneous syndromes that manifest in dysfunctions across multiple brain regions, cell types, and circuits. Biomarkers using brain-wide activity patterns in humans have proven useful in distinguishing between disorder subtypes and identifying effective treatments. In order to improve biomarker identification, it is crucial to understand the basic circuitry underpinning brain-wide activity patterns. Leveraging a large repertoire of techniques, animal studies have examined roles of specific cell types and circuits in driving maladaptive behavior.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0d96b8be-d794-45bc-be33-dfb2a5dabcdc/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus&lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Overt speech feasibility using continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging: Isolation of areas involved in phonology and prosody&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/805ea78b-76c7-4097-8833-300a61a3478f/jnr24723-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated the effects of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed with natural speaking, on the results of linguistic activations. We found that overt speaking during fMRI induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid motion artifacts, almost all speech‐related functional magnetic resonance imagings (fMRIs) are performed covertly to detect language activations. This method may be difficult to execute, especially by patients with brain tumors, and does not allow the identification of phonological areas. Here, we aimed to evaluate overt task feasibility. Thirty‐three volunteers participated in this study. They performed two functional sessions of covert and overt generation of a short sentence semantically linked with a word. Three main contrasts were performed: Covert and Overt for the isolation of language‐activated areas, and Overt &amp;gt; Covert for the isolation of the motor cortical activation of speech. fMRI data preprocessing was performed with and without unwarping, and with and without regression of movement parameters as confounding variables. All types of results were compared to each other. For the Overt contrast, Dice coefficients showed strong overlap between each pair of types of results: 0.98 for the pair with and without unwarping, and 0.9 for the pair with and without movement parameter regression. The Overt &amp;gt; Covert contrast allowed isolation of motor laryngeal activations with high statistical reliability and revealed the right‐lateralized temporal activity related to acoustic feedback. Overt speaking during magnetic resonance imaging induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech. Unwarping and motion artifact regression in the postprocessing step, seem to not be necessary. Changes in lateralization of cortical activity by overt speech shall be explored before using these tasks for presurgical mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Evaluating Lipid‐Lowering Drug Targets for Parkinson's Disease Prevention with Mendelian Randomization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25880?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25880?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.

	<title>Hippocampus: Interindividual differences in memory system local field potential activity predict behavioral strategy on a dual‐solution T‐maze</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23258?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can use diverse behavioral strategies to navigate their environment including hippocampal‐dependent place strategies reliant upon cognitive maps and striatal‐dependent response strategies reliant upon egocentric body turns. The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague–Dawley rats on a dual‐solution T‐maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal‐hippocampal theta activity was in‐phase in response rats and out‐of‐phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal‐hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal‐hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze‐learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Developmental onset of enduring long‐term potentiation in mouse hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23257?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provides a powerful window into cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Prior work shows late LTP (L‐LTP), lasting &amp;gt;3 hr, occurs abruptly at postnatal day 12 (P12) in the &lt;i&gt;stratum radiatum&lt;/i&gt; of rat hippocampal area CA1. The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L‐LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; on the C57BL/6J background, and 129SVE and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sparcl1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse‐induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10‐P35 in the expression of short‐term potentiation (STP), lasting ≤1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L‐LTP onset (&amp;gt;25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP (&amp;gt;50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L‐LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3–4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks. Although some of the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed L‐LTP before 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP also was not achieved until 5 weeks. L‐LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta‐burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals. These findings show important species differences in the onset of STP and L‐LTP, which occur at the same age in rats but are sequentially acquired in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Synapses are inferred between unconnected but correlated neurons. Inference based on non-equilibrium activity may help remedy this.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/oNisqsGFfBw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
