	<description>Cerebellar granule cells are a popular target of neuroanatomical hyperbole, being so small and so numerous. Early theorists proposed unique roles for this vast cell population, ideas that continue to be tested through contemporary approaches. In 2017, a cluster of empirical and theoretical papers offered a fresh and singular look into the functions of granule cells and the computational advantages of their idiosyncratic circuit organization.</description>

	<description>Locomotion is generated by intrinsically oscillating circuits in the spinal cord that are modulated by information from the brain and periphery. In their seminal 1987 publication, Buchanan and Grillner provided for the first time evidence for excitatory spinal neurons receiving inputs from descending commands and sensory afferents, and synapsing onto motoneurons and commissural inhibitory interneurons. These critical findings established the circuit model for central pattern generators incorporating excitatory interneurons’ role in the rhythm-production mechanism.</description>

	<description>The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly conserved signaling system regulating a range of developmental processes. A 1997 paper by Goodrich and colleagues provided major contributions to understanding the Hh pathway by mutating the gene encoding the Hh receptor, Patched, and thereby developing a mouse model for a human cancer predisposition syndrome, known as Gorlin syndrome. These studies provided one of the first genetically engineered mouse models for brain tumors.</description>

	<description>Across the animal kingdom, odors are known as potent stimuli that directly steer behavior. In 2007, Hitoshi Sakano and colleagues used the power of mouse genetics to manipulate the odor map in the olfactory bulb. Elegant behavioral, anatomical, and physiological analyses revealed an apparent dichotomy in how the brain interprets the odor map. Their work paved a way to think of behavioral contingencies as part of early olfactory processing, highlighting innate and learned pathways.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Two Cognitive Transitions Underlying the Capacity for Cultural Evolution. (arXiv:1811.10431v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10431</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10431</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes that the distinctively human capacity for cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended cultural evolution came about through two
temporally-distinct cognitive transitions. First, the origin of Homo-specific
culture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained
associative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This
in turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these
episodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through
self-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the
chaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.
Second, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical
modernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus
(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to
logic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to
free-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept
combination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an
integrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral
modernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,
and outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide
computational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of
cultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the
fittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions
across the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but
CF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective
following a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping
mental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory
in the life sciences.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10111</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present the first real-time sleep staging system that uses deep learning
without the need for servers in a smartphone application for a wearable EEG. We
employ real-time adaptation of a single channel Electroencephalography (EEG) to
infer from a Time-Distributed 1-D Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
Polysomnography (PSG)-the gold standard for sleep staging, requires a human
scorer and is both complex and resource-intensive. Our work demonstrates an
end-to-end on-smartphone pipeline that can infer sleep stages in just single
30-second epochs, with an overall accuracy of 83.5% on 20-fold cross validation
for five-class classification of sleep stages using the open Sleep-EDF dataset.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical neurons whose activity is recorded in behavioral experiments has
been classified into several types such as stimulus-related neurons,
delay-period neurons, and reward-related neurons. Moreover, the population
activity of neurons during a reaching task can be described by dynamics in
low-dimensional space. These results suggest that the low-dimensional dynamics
of a few types of neurons emerge in the cerebral cortex that is trained to
perform a task. This study investigates a simple neural circuit emerges with a
few types of neurons. Assuming an infinite number of neurons in the circuit
with connection weights drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we model the
dynamics of neurons by using a kernel function. Given that the system is
infinitely large, almost all capable circuits approximate the most probable
circuit for the task. We simulate two delayed response tasks and a
motor-pattern generation task. The model network exhibits low-dimensional
dynamics in all tasks. Considering that the connection weights are drawn from a
Gaussian distribution, the most probable circuit is the circuit with the
smallest connection weight; that is, the simplest circuit with the simplest
dynamics. Finally, we relate the dynamics to algorithmic information theory.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing is often characterized as implementing probabilistic
inference: networks of neurons compute posterior beliefs over unobserved causes
given the sensory inputs. How these beliefs are computed and represented by
neural responses is much-debated (Fiser et al. 2010, Pouget et al. 2013). A
central debate concerns the question of whether neural responses represent
samples of latent variables (Hoyer &amp;amp; Hyvarinnen 2003) or parameters of their
distributions (Ma et al. 2006) with efforts being made to distinguish between
them (Grabska-Barwinska et al. 2013). A separate debate addresses the question
of whether neural responses are proportionally related to the encoded
probabilities (Barlow 1969), or proportional to the logarithm of those
probabilities (Jazayeri &amp;amp; Movshon 2006, Ma et al. 2006, Beck et al. 2012).
Here, we show that these alternatives - contrary to common assumptions - are
not mutually exclusive and that the very same system can be compatible with all
of them. As a central analytical result, we show that modeling neural responses
in area V1 as samples from a posterior distribution over latents in a linear
Gaussian model of the image implies that those neural responses form a linear
Probabilistic Population Code (PPC, Ma et al. 2006). In particular, the
posterior distribution over some experimenter-defined variable like
&quot;orientation&quot; is part of the exponential family with sufficient statistics that
are linear in the neural sampling-based firing rates.

The direct-site hypothesis assumes general anesthetics bind ion channels to impact protein equilibrium and function, inducing anesthesia. Despite advancements in the field, a first principle all-atom demonstration of this structure-function premise is still missing. We focus on the clinically used sevoflurane interaction to anesthetic-sensitive Kv1.2 mammalian channel to resolve if sevoflurane binds protein’s well-characterized open and closed structures in a conformation-dependent manner to shift channel equilibrium. We employ an innovative approach relying on extensive docking calculations and free-energy perturbation of all potential binding sites revealed by the latter, and find sevoflurane binds open and closed structures at multiple sites under complex saturation and concentration effects. Results point to a non-trivial interplay of site and conformation-dependent modes of action involving distinct binding sites that increase channel open-probability at diluted ligand concentrations. Given the challenge in exploring more complex processes potentially impacting channel-anesthetic interaction, the result is revealing as it demonstrates the process of multiple anesthetic binding events alone may account for open-probability shifts recorded in measurements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R7l5I-sNaNM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comprehensive computational modelling of the development of mammalian cortical connectivity underlying an architectonic type principle</title>

The architectonic type principle relates patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity to the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions. One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YGzOoH1dEQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Determinants of early afterdepolarization properties in ventricular myocyte models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006382</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaodong Huang, Zhen Song, Zhilin Qu&lt;/p&gt;

Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are spontaneous depolarizations during the repolarization phase of an action potential in cardiac myocytes. It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of I&lt;sub&gt;Ca,L&lt;/sub&gt; and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in I&lt;sub&gt;Ca,L&lt;/sub&gt; recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vXy6RgqS0DE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Adenosine signaling though A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons show that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a GIRK-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adenosine is a potent modulator of all aspects of breathing including chemoreception at the level of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN); however, mechanisms by which adenosine regulates activity of RTN chemoreceptors is not known. Here, we show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits RTN neurons by activation of an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and by selective suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors. These results identify a GIRK-like conductance as the first target of purinergic signaling in chemosensitive RTN neurons. This work may also have clinical relevance since A1 receptor antagonists like caffeine are used to treat respiratory problems in premature infancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Newly Identified Electrically Coupled Neurons Support Development of the Drosophila Giant Fiber Model Circuit</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Giant Fiber (GF) escape circuit is an extensively studied model for neuron connectivity and function. Researchers have long taken advantage of the simple linear neuronal pathway, which begins at peripheral sensory modalities, travels through the central GF Interneuron (GFI) to motor neurons, and terminates on wing/leg muscles. This circuit is more complex than it seems however, as there exists a complex web of coupled neurons connected to the GFI, which widely innervate the thoracic ganglion. Here, we define four new neuron clusters dye-coupled to the central GFI, which we name GF Coupled (GFC) 1-4. We identify new transgenic Gal4 drivers that express specifically in these neurons, and map both neuronal architecture and synaptic polarity. GFC1-4 share a central site of GFI connectivity, the Inframedial Bridge (IB), where the neurons each form electrical synapses. Targeted apoptotic ablation of GFC1 reveals a key role for proper development of the GF circuit, including the maintenance of GFI connectivity with upstream and downstream synaptic partners. GFC1 ablation frequently results in loss of one GFI, which is always compensated for by contralateral innervation from a branch of the persisting GFI axon. Overall, this work reveals extensively coupled interconnectivity within the GF circuit, and the requirement of coupled neurons for circuit development. Identification of this large population of electrically-coupled neurons in this classic model, and the ability to genetically manipulate these electrically synapsed neurons, expands the GF system capabilities for the nuanced, sophisticated circuit dissection necessary for deeper investigations into brain formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Genetic model neural circuits with individually identifiable neurons help us understand how nervous systems wire together during development, and then operate through coordinated chemical and electrical signaling. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Giant Fiber circuit has long served as such a model, due to large neuron size, genetic malleability and easily visualized behavioral output: a jump in response to a threat. This study unveils new members of this circuit, all of which synapse with the circuit at one site on the central Giant Fiber Interneuron. We use new tools to identify and transgenically manipulate these neurons and show that these neurons are required for proper circuit development. This study provides a detailed circuit map for further dissection of neuronal connectivity and electrically-coupled communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Obesogenic diets lead to overeating and obesity by inducing the expression of genes involved in hedonic and homeostatic responses in specific brain regions. However, how the effects on gene expression are coordinated in the brain so far remains largely unknown. In our study, we provided mice with access to energy-dense diet, which induced overeating and overweight, and we explored the transcriptome changes across the main regions involved in feeding and energy balance: hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, we detected two regulatory processes: a switch-like regulation with differentially expressed genes changing over 1.5-fold, and &quot;fine-tuned&quot; subtler changes of genes whose levels correlated with body weight and behavioral changes. We found that genes in both categories were positioned within specific topologically associating domains (TADs), which were often differently regulated across different brain regions. These TADs were enriched in genes relevant for the physiological and behavioral observed changes. Our results suggest that chromatin structure coordinates diet-dependent transcriptional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mice fed with free-choice access to chocolate mixture become overweight and compulsive, recapitulating what happens during obesity. For the first time, we correlated these physical and behavioural changes with the transcriptome in the frontal cortex and the striatum, involved in the hedonic &quot;liking&quot; associated to eating, and the hypothalamus, involved in the homeostasic regulation of food intake. We detected two groups of genes: some transcript were strongly deregulated in term of fold changes; while others were only subtly deregulated but were especially correlating with measurements associated with body-weight and compulsivity. These genes were not randomly distributed, but were positioned in chromatin domains, many of which rich in genes differentially co-regulated across brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Hierarchical Cognition causes Task Related Deactivations but not just in Default Mode Regions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0008-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; region not &lt;i&gt;currently&lt;/i&gt; involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Social Innovation and the Evolution of Creative, Sustainable Worldviews. (arXiv:1811.09588v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09588</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09588</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ideas that we forge creatively as individuals and groups build on one
another in a manner that is cumulative and adaptive, forming open-ended
lineages across space and time. Thus, human culture is believed to evolve. The
pervasiveness of cross-domain creativity--as when a song inspires a
painting--would appear indicative of discontinuities in cultural lineages.
However, if what evolves through culture is our worldviews--the webs of
thoughts, ideas, and attitudes that constitutes our way of seeing being in the
world--then the problem of discontinuities is solved. The state of a worldview
can be affected by information assimilated in one domain, and this
change-of-state can be expressed in another domain. In this view, the gesture,
narrative, or artifact that constitutes a specific creative act is not what is
evolving; it is merely the external manifestation of the state of an evolving
worldview. Like any evolutionary process, cultural evolution requires a balance
between novelty, via the generation of variation, and continuity, via the
preservation of variants that are adaptive. In cultural evolution, novelty is
generated through creativity, and continuity is provided by social learning
processes, e.g., imitation. Both the generative and imitative aspects of
cultural evolution are affected by social media. We discuss the trajectory from
social ideation to social innovation, focusing on the role of
self-organization, renewal, and perspective-taking at the individual and social
group level.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quenched asymptotics for interacting diffusions on inhomogeneous random graphs. (arXiv:1811.09229v1 [math.PR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09229</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09229</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the paper is to address the behavior in large population of
diffusions interacting on a random, possibly diluted and inhomogeneous graph.
This is the natural continuation of a previous work, where the homogeneous
Erd\H os-R\'enyi case was considered. The class of graphs we consider includes
disordered $W$-random graphs, with possibly unbounded graphons. The main result
concerns a quenched convergence (that is true for almost every realization of
the random graph) of the empirical measure of the system towards the solution
of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck PDE with spatial extension, also appearing in
different contexts, especially in neuroscience. The convergence of the spatial
profile associated to the diffusions is also considered, and one proves that
the limit is described in terms of a nonlinear integro-differential equation
which matches the neural field equation in certain particular cases.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43326</link>
	<description>Glia are important modulators of neural activity, yet few studies link glia to sleep regulation. We find that blocking activity of the endocytosis protein, dynamin, in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; glia increases sleep and enhances sleep need, manifest as resistance to sleep deprivation. Surface glia comprising the fly equivalent of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediate the effect of dynamin on sleep. Blocking dynamin in the surface glia causes ultrastructural changes, albeit without compromising the integrity of the barrier. Supporting a role for endocytic trafficking in sleep, a screen of Rab GTPases identifies sleep-modulating effects of the recycling endosome Rab11 in surface glia. We also find that endocytosis is increased in BBB glia during sleep and reflects sleep need. We propose that endocytic trafficking through the BBB represents a function of sleep.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Splicing factors Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct roles in mitotic chromosome segregation</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40325</link>
	<description>Several studies have shown that RNAi-mediated depletion of splicing factors (SFs) results in mitotic abnormalities. However, it is currently unclear whether these abnormalities reflect defective splicing of specific pre-mRNAs or a direct role of the SFs in mitosis. Here we show that two highly conserved SFs, Sf3A2 and Prp31, are required for chromosome segregation in both &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and human cells. Injections of anti-Sf3A2 and anti-Prp31 antibodies into &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos disrupt mitotic division within 1 minute, arguing strongly against a splicing-related mitotic function of these factors. We demonstrate that both SFs bind spindle microtubules (MTs) and the Ndc80 complex, which in Sf3A2- and Prp31-depleted cells is not tightly associated with the kinetochores; in HeLa cells the Ndc80/HEC1-SF interaction is restricted to the M phase. These results indicate that Sf3A2 and Prp31 directly regulate interactions among kinetochores, spindle microtubules and the Ndc80 complex in both &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;and human cells.</description>

	<description>Nephron segmentation involves a concert of genetic and molecular signals that are not fully understood. Through a chemical screen, we discovered that alteration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling disrupts nephron segmentation in the zebrafish embryonic kidney (Poureetezadi et al., 2016). Here, we show that the PPAR co-activator &lt;i&gt;ppargc1a&lt;/i&gt; directs renal progenitor fate. &lt;i&gt;ppargc1a&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;mutants form a small distal late (DL) segment and an expanded proximal straight tubule (PST) segment. &lt;i&gt;ppargc1a&lt;/i&gt; promotes DL fate by regulating the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;tbx2b,&lt;/i&gt; and restricts expression of the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;sim1a &lt;/i&gt;to inhibit PST fate. Interestingly, &lt;i&gt;sim1a &lt;/i&gt;restricts &lt;i&gt;ppargc1a &lt;/i&gt;expression to promote the PST, and PST development is fully restored in &lt;i&gt;ppargc1a/sim1a&lt;/i&gt; deficient embryos, suggesting Ppargc1a and Sim1a counterbalance each other in an antagonistic fashion to delineate the PST segment boundary during nephrogenesis. Taken together, our data reveal new roles for Ppargc1a during development, which have implications for understanding renal birth defects.</description>

	<description>Sensory deprivation during the post-natal 'critical period' leads to structural reorganization of the developing visual cortex. In adulthood, the visual cortex retains some flexibility and adapts to sensory deprivation. Here we show that short-term (2h) monocular deprivation in adult humans boosts the BOLD response to the deprived eye, changing ocular dominance of V1 vertices, consistent with homeostatic plasticity. The boost is strongest in V1, present in V2, V3 and V4 but absent in V3a and hMT+. Assessment of spatial frequency tuning in V1 by a population Receptive-Field technique shows that deprivation primarily boosts high spatial frequencies, consistent with a primary involvement of the parvocellular pathway. Crucially, the V1 deprivation effect correlates across participants with the perceptual increase of the deprived eye dominance assessed with binocular rivalry, suggesting a common origin. Our results demonstrate that visual cortex, particularly the ventral pathway, retains a high potential for homeostatic plasticity in the human adult.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Translational initiation factor eIF5 replaces eIF1 on the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote start-codon recognition</title>

	<description>In eukaryotic translation initiation AUG recognition of the mRNA requires accommodation of Met-tRNA&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in a 'P&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;' state, which is antagonized by the factor eIF1. eIF5 is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of eIF2 that additionally promotes stringent AUG selection, but the molecular basis of its dual function was unknown. We present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a yeast 48S pre-initiation complex (PIC), at an overall resolution of 3.0 Å, featuring the N-terminal domain (NTD) of eIF5 bound to the 40S subunit at the location vacated by eIF1. eIF5 interacts with and allows a more accommodated orientation of Met-tRNA&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Substitutions of eIF5 residues involved in the eIF5-NTD/tRNA&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; interaction influenced initiation at near-cognate UUG codons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and the closed/open PIC conformation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, consistent with direct stabilization of the codon:anticodon duplex by the wild-type eIF5-NTD. The present structure reveals the basis for a key role of eIF5 in start-codon selection.</description>

	<description>Changes in cancer cell identity can alter malignant potential and therapeutic response. Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 augments the growth of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma and causes pulmonary to gastric transdifferentiation. Here we show that the transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for initiation of mucinous NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinomas in the mouse and for activation of their gastric differentiation program. &lt;i&gt;Foxa1/2&lt;/i&gt; deletion severely impairs tumor initiation and causes a proximal shift in cellular identity, yielding tumors expressing markers of the squamocolumnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, we observe downregulation of FoxA1/2 expression in the squamous component of both murine and human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Using sequential in vivo recombination, we find that FoxA1/2 loss in established KRAS-driven neoplasia originating from SPC-positive alveolar cells induces keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung cancer in a context-specific manner.</description>

	<description>Mechanical forces between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) influence cell shape and function. Tendons are ECM-rich tissues connecting muscles with bones that bear extreme tensional force. Analysis of transgenic zebrafish expressing mCherry driven by the tendon determinant &lt;i&gt;scleraxis &lt;/i&gt;reveals that tendon fibroblasts (tenocytes) extend arrays of microtubule-rich projections at the onset of muscle contraction. In the trunk, these form a dense curtain along the myotendinous junctions at somite boundaries, perpendicular to myofibers, suggesting a role as force sensors to control ECM production and tendon strength. Paralysis or destabilization of microtubules reduces projection length and surrounding ECM, both of which are rescued by muscle stimulation. Paralysis also reduces SMAD3 phosphorylation in tenocytes and chemical inhibition of TGFβ signaling shortens tenocyte projections. These results suggest that TGFβ, released in response to force, acts on tenocytes to alter their morphology and ECM production, revealing a feedback mechanism by which tendons adapt to tension.</description>

	<description>The &lt;i&gt;E.coli &lt;/i&gt;ribosome exit tunnel can accommodate small folded proteins, while larger ones fold outside. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the geometry of the tunnel influences protein folding. Here, using &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ribosomes with deletions in loops in proteins uL23 and uL24 that protrude into the tunnel, we investigate how tunnel geometry determines where proteins of different sizes fold. We find that a 29-residue zinc-finger domain normally folding close to the uL23 loop folds deeper in the tunnel in uL23 Dloop ribosomes, while two ~100-residue protein normally folding close to the uL24 loop near the tunnel exit port fold at deeper locations in uL24 Dloop ribosomes, in good agreement with results obtained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This supports the idea that cotranslational folding commences once a protein domain reaches a location in the exit tunnel where there is sufficient space to house the folded structure.</description>

	<description>Synthetic lethality results when mutant KRAS and EGFR proteins are co-expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, revealing the biological basis for mutual exclusivity of &lt;i&gt;KRAS &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;EGFR &lt;/i&gt;mutations. We have now defined the biochemical events responsible for the toxic effects by combining pharmacological and genetic approaches and to show that signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) mediates the toxicity. These findings imply that tumors with mutant oncogenes in the RAS pathway must restrain the activity of ERK1/2 to avoid toxicities and enable tumor growth. A dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP6, that negatively regulates phosphorylation of (P)-ERK is up-regulated in EGFR- or KRAS-mutant LUAD, potentially protecting cells with mutations in the RAS signaling pathway, a proposal supported by experiments with &lt;i&gt;DUSP6&lt;/i&gt;-specific siRNA and an inhibitory drug. Targeting DUSP6 or other negative regulators might offer a treatment strategy for certain cancers by inducing the toxic effects of RAS-mediated signaling.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Categorical encoding of decision variables in orbitofrontal cortex</title>

	<description>A fundamental and recurrent question in systems neuroscience is that of assessing what variables are encoded by a given population of neurons. Such assessments are often challenging because neurons in one brain area may encode multiple variables, and because neuronal representations might be categorical (different neurons encoding different variables) or mixed (individual neurons encoding a combination of variables). These issues are particularly pertinent to the representation of decision variables in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) - an area implicated in economic choices. Here we present a new algorithm to assess whether a neuronal representation is categorical or mixed, and to identify the encoded variables if the representation is indeed categorical. The algorithm is based on two clustering procedures, one variable-independent and the other variable-based. The two partitions are then compared through adjusted mutual information. The present algorithm overcomes limitations of previous approaches and is widely applicable. We tested the algorithm on synthetic data and then used it to examine neuronal data recorded in the primate OFC during economic decisions. Confirming previous assessments, we found the neuronal representation in OFC to be categorical in nature. We also found that neurons in this area encode the value of individual offers, the binary choice outcome and the chosen value. In other words, during economic choice, neurons in the primate OFC encode decision variables in a categorical way.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during volitional finger movements. I. Laterality and relationship to motor learning.</title>

	<description>Hippocampal interactions with the motor system are often assumed to reflect the role of memory in motor learning. Here, we examine hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during two tasks requiring paced movements, one with a mnemonic component (sequence learning) and one without (repetitive tapping). Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects; connectivity was identified from sensorimotor cortex (SMC) correlations with psychophysiological interactions in hippocampal activity between motor and passive visual tasks. Finger movements in both motor tasks anticipated the timing of the metronome, reflecting cognitive control, yet evidence of motor learning was limited to the sequence learning task; nonetheless, hippocampal connectivity was observed during both tasks. Connectivity from corresponding regions in the left and right hippocampus overlapped extensively, with improved sensitivity resulting from their conjunctive (global) analysis. The cortical laterality of SMC connectivity depended both on the hippocampal source and the task. Functionally-defined seeds produced bilateral connectivity within the hand representation, regardless of whether finger movements were uni- or bimanual; these seeds were located mid-lateral within the hippocampus, whereas structural seeds were located in the posterior hippocampus and produced unilateral connectivity. Results implicate the hippocampus in volitional finger movements even in the absence of motor learning or recall.</description>

	<description>Cognitive control refers to brain processes involved in regulating behavior according to internal goals or plans. This study examines whether hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during paced movements shows a pattern of spatial and temporal selectivity required for cognitive control. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects during a paced, non-mnemonic (repetitive tapping) motor task. Connectivity was examined from psychophysiological interactions in hippocampal activity during two analyses: the first identified motor interactions relative to rest, whereas the second identified differential motor activity between adjacent fingers. Connectivity was observed in both pre- and postcentral gyrus, but only postcentral connectivity was topographical, coincident with finger representations identified in a previous study. Differences in the magnitude of connectivity were observed between finger representations, representing spatial selectivity for the target of movements; the postcentral representation of the moving finger invariably showed greater connectivity than adjacent fingers. Furthermore, the magnitude of connectivity within a pre- or postcentral finger representation was largest when its finger moved, representing temporal selectivity for movement. While the hippocampus is known to be sensitive to spatial and temporal features of the environment, consistent with its role in learning and memory, the pattern of spatial and temporal selectivity of hippocampal connectivity observed in this study occurred during volitional movements in the absence of motor learning or recall. Spatial and temporal selectivity of connectivity during volitional movements meets the criteria for cognitive control adapted from oculomotor studies, suggesting a role for the hippocampus in motor control.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Homeostatic versus pathological functions of Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase in the adult mouse brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/479378v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/479378v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK, Map3k12), is an injury-induced axonal protein that governs the balance between degeneration and regeneration through its downstream effectors c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated c-jun (p-c-Jun). DLK is generally considered to be inactive in healthy neurons until induced by injury. However we report that DLK in the cerebellum appears constitutively active and drives nuclear p-c-Jun in cerebellar granule neurons in the absence of injury. In contrast the adult hippocampus expresses similar levels of apparently constitutively active DLK, but p-c-Jun is lower and does not accumulate in the nucleus. Injury is required there for p-c-jun nuclear expression, because in the rTg4510 model of tauopathy, where there is extensive hippocampal pathology, nuclear p-c-Jun is induced in a DLK-dependent manner. This context-specific regulation of DLK signaling could relate to availability of JNK scaffolding proteins, as the cerebellum preferentially expresses JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) whereas the hippocampus contains more JIP-3 and Plenty of SH3 (POSH). To understand how DLK signaling differs between the hippocampus and cerebellum, we selectively blocked DLK and measured changes in protein and mRNA expression. In the cerebellum, p-c-Jun levels correlated with synaptophysin, suggesting a link between DLK activity and synaptic maintenance. In rTg4510 mice, hippocampal p-c-Jun instead correlated with markers of neuronal injury and gliosis (Iba1 and GFAP). RNA sequencing revealed that in both brain regions DLK inhibition reduced expression of JNK/c-Jun pathway components and a novel set of co-regulated genes. In the cerebellum, Jun mRNA levels were co-regulated with genes mapping to metabolic pathways, while in the rTg4510 hippocampus, Jun-correlated mRNAs correspond primarily to neuroinflammation. These data suggest that in the uninjured cerebellum, DLK/p-c-Jun signaling is linked to synaptic regulation, but in the hippocampus, pathologically activated DLK/p-c-Jun signaling regulates genes associated with the injury response.</description>

	<description>The nucleus reuniens (NR) is an important anatomical and functional relay between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Whether the NR controls neuronal assemblies - a hallmark of information exchange between the HPC and mPFC for memory transfer/consolidation - is not known. Using simultaneous LFP and unit recordings in NR, HPC and mPFC in rats during slow oscillations under anesthesia, we identified a reliable sequential activation of NR neurons at the beginning of UP states, which preceded mPFC ones. NR sequences were spatially organized, from dorsal to ventral NR. Chemical inactivation of the NR disrupted mPFC sequences at the onset of UP states as well as HPC sequences present during sharp-wave ripples. We conclude that the NR contributes to the coordination and stabilization of mPFC and HPC neuronal sequences during slow oscillations, possibly via the early activation of its own sequences.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Six‐months assessment of a hand prosthesis with intraneural tactile feedback</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a six months clinical study with three trans‐radial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Despite the canonical homogenous character of its organization, the cerebellum plays differential computational roles in distinct types of sensorimotor behaviors. However, the molecular and cell physiological underpinnings are unclear. Here we determined the contribution of transient receptor potential cation channel type C3 (TRPC3) to signal processing in different cerebellar modules. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function mouse models, we found that TRPC3 controls the simple spike activity of zebrin-negative (Z-), but not of zebrin-positive (Z+), Purkinje cells. Moreover, in vivo TRPC3 also regulated complex spike firing and its interaction with simple spikes exclusively in Z- Purkinje cells. Finally, we found that eyeblink conditioning, related to Z- modules, but not compensatory eye movement adaptation, linked to Z+ modules, was affected in TRPC3 loss-of-function mice. Together, our results indicate that TRPC3 is essential for the cellular heterogeneity that introduces distinct physiological properties in an otherwise homogeneous population of Purkinje cells, conjuring functional heterogeneity in cerebellar sensorimotor integration.</description>

	<description>The biological basis of the increased risk for psychiatric disorders due to the pathogenic 15q11.2 copy number deletion is unknown. Previous work has shown disturbances in white matter tracts in human carriers of the deletion at this locus. Using a novel rat model, we have recapitulated low dosage of the candidate risk gene CYFIP1 present within the 15q11.2 interval to reveal alterations in white matter microstructure. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we first showed extensive white matter changes in Cyfip1 mutants that were most pronounced in the corpus callosum and external capsule. Transmission electron microscopy showed that these changes were associated with thinning of the myelin sheath in the corpus callosum. Myelin thinning was independent of changes in axon number or diameter but was associated with a reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes. Finally, we demonstrated functional effects on cognitive phenotypes sensitive to both disruptions in myelin and callosal circuitry.</description>

	<description>Understanding how gene expression translates to and affects human behaviour is one of the ultimate aims of neuroscience. In this paper, we present a pipeline based on Mapper, a topological simplification tool, to produce and analyze genes co-expression data. We first validate the method by reproducing key results from the literature on the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and the correlations between resting-state fMRI and gene co-expression maps. We then analyze a dopamine-related gene-set and find that co-expression networks produced by Mapper returned a structure that matches the well-known anatomy of the dopaminergic pathway. Our results suggest that topological network descriptions can be a powerful tool to explore the relationships between genetic pathways and their association with brain function and its perturbation due to illness and/or pharmacological challenge.</description>

	<description>Most real-world decisions involve a delicate balance between exploring unfamiliar alternatives and committing to the best known option. Uncertainty lies at the core of this ''explore-exploit'' dilemma, for if all options were perfectly known, there would be no need to explore. Yet despite the prominent role of uncertainty-guided exploration in decision making, evidence for its neural implementation is still sparse. We investigated this question with model-based fMRI (n = 31) using a two-armed bandit task that independently manipulates two forms of uncertainty underlying different exploration strategies. The relative uncertainty between the two options was encoded in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drove directed exploration, a strategy that adds an uncertainty bonus to each option. The total uncertainty across the two options was encoded in left anterior insula and drove random exploration, a strategy that increases choice stochasticity in proportion to total uncertainty. The subjective estimates of uncertainty from both regions were predictive of subject choices. In addition, the encoding of total uncertainty in anterior insula across subjects predicted differences in the extent to which they employed random exploration. These results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Word meanings and sentence structure recruit the same set of fronto-temporal regions during comprehension</title>

	<description>To understand what you are reading now, your mind retrieves the meanings of words from a linguistic knowledge store (lexico-semantic processing) and identifies the relationships among them to construct a complex meaning (syntactic or combinatorial processing). Do these two sets of processes rely on distinct, specialized mechanisms or, rather, share a common pool of resources? Linguistic theorizing and empirical evidence from language acquisition and processing have yielded a picture whereby lexico-semantic and syntactic processing are deeply inter-connected. In contrast, most current proposals of the neural architecture of language continue to endorse a view whereby certain brain regions selectively support lexico-semantic storage/processing whereas others selectively support syntactic/combinatorial storage/processing, despite inconsistent evidence for this division of linguistic labor across brain regions. Here, we searched for a dissociation between lexico-semantic and syntactic processing using a powerful individual-subjects fMRI approach across three sentence comprehension paradigms (n=49 participants total): responses to lexico-semantic vs. syntactic violations (Experiment 1); recovery from neural suppression across pairs of sentences differing in lexical items vs. syntactic structure (Experiment 2); and same/different meaning judgments on such sentence pairs (Experiment 3). Across experiments, both lexico-semantic and syntactic conditions elicited robust responses throughout the language network. Critically, no regions were more strongly engaged by syntactic than lexico-semantic processing, although some regions showed the opposite pattern. Thus, contra many current proposals of the neural architecture of language, lexico-semantic and syntactic/combinatorial processing are not separable at the level of brain regions - or even voxel subsets - within the language network, in line with strong integration between these two processes that has been consistently observed in behavioral language research. The results further suggest that the language network may be generally more strongly concerned with meaning than structure, in line with the primary function of language - to share meanings across minds.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Predict future learning accuracy by the structural properties of the brain, an in vivo longitudinal MRI study in songbirds</title>

	<description>Human speech and bird song are acoustically complex communication signals that are learned by imitation during a sensitive period early in life. Although the neural networks indispensable for song learning are well established, it remains unclear which neural circuits differentiate good from bad song copiers. By combining in vivo structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging with song analyses in juvenile male zebra finches during song learning and beyond, we discovered that song imitation accuracy correlates with the structural architecture of four distinct brain areas, none of which pertain to the song control system. Furthermore, the structural properties of a secondary auditory area in the left hemisphere, are capable to predict future song copying accuracy, already at the earliest stages of learning, before initiating vocal practicing. These findings appoint novel brain regions important for song learning outcome and inform that ultimate performance in part depends on factors experienced before vocal practicing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Entorhinal neurons exhibit cue locking in rodent VR</title>

	<description>The regular firing pattern exhibited by medial entorhinal (mEC) grid cells of locomoting rodents is hypothesized to provide spatial metric information relevant for navigation. The development of virtual reality (VR) for head-fixed mice confers a number of experimental advantages and has become increasingly popular as a method for investigating spatially-selective cells. Recent experiments using 1D VR linear tracks have shown that some mEC cells have multiple fields in virtual space, analogous to grid cells on real linear tracks. We recorded from the mEC as mice traversed virtual tracks featuring regularly spaced repetitive cues and identified a population of cells with multiple firing fields, resembling the regular firing of grid cells. However, further analyses indicated that many of these were not, in fact, grid cells because: 1) When recorded in the open field they did not display discrete firing fields with six-fold symmetry; 2) In different VR environments their firing fields were found to match the spatial frequency of repetitive environmental cues. In contrast, cells identified as grid cells based on their open field firing patterns did not exhibit cue locking. In light of these results we highlight the importance of controlling the periodicity of the visual cues in VR and the necessity of identifying grid cells from real open field environments in order to correctly characterise spatially modulated neurons in VR experiments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Strong preference for autaptic self-connectivity of neocortical PV interneurons entrains them to γ-oscillations</title>

	<description>Parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons modulate cortical activity through highly specialized connectivity patterns onto excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) and other inhibitory cells. PV cells are auto-connected through powerful autapses, but the contribution of this form of fast disinhibition to cortical function is unknown. We found that autaptic transmission represents the most powerful input of PV cells in neocortical Layer V. Autaptic strength was greater than synaptic strength onto PNs as result of a larger quantal size, whereas autaptic and heterosynaptic PV-PV synapses differed in the number of release sites. Overall, single-axon autaptic transmission contributed to ~40% of the total perisomatic inhibition that PV interneurons received. The strength of autaptic transmission modulated the coupling of PV-cell firing with optogenetically-induced {gamma}-oscillations preventing high frequency bursts of spikes. Autaptic self-inhibition represents an exceptionally large and fast disinhibitory mechanism to synchronize the output of PV cells during cognitive-relevant cortical network activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Iodine-enhanced micro-CT imaging of soft tissue on the example of peripheral nerve regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/477539v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Microcomputed tomography (microCT) is widely used for the study of mineralized tissues but a similar use for soft tissues is hindered by their low X-ray attenuation. This limitation can be overcome by the recent development of different staining techniques. Staining with Lugol's solution, a mixture of one part iodine and two parts potassium iodine in water stands out among these techniques for its low complexity and cost. Currently, Lugol staining is mostly used for anatomical study of tissues. In the present study we seek to optimize the quality and reproducibility of the staining for ex vivo visualization of soft tissues in the context of a peripheral nerve regeneration model in the rat. We show that the staining result not only depends on the concentration of the staining solution, but also on the amount of stain in relation to the tissue volume and composition, necessitating careful adaptation of the staining to the tissue. This optimization can be simplified by a stepwise staining which we show to yield a similar result compared to staining in a single step. Lugol staining solution results in concentration dependent tissue shrinkage which can be minimized but not eliminated. We compared the shrinkage of tendon, nerve, skeletal muscle, heart, brain and kidney with six iterations of Lugol staining. 60 ml of 0.3% Lugol's solution per cm3 of tissue for 24h yielded good results on the example of peripheral nerve regeneration model and we could show that the regenerating nerve inside a silk fibroin tube can be visualized in 3D using this staining technique. This information helps in deciding the region of interest for histological imaging and provides a 3D context to histological findings. Correlating both imaging modalities has the potential to improve the understanding of the regenerative process.</description>

	<description>Adult rats were trained to use their forepaw for retrieving a piece of noodle through a slit in the front of the cage. The dorsal corticospinal tract was lesioned by a focal stereotactic radio-frequency lesion at the level of the first/second cervical segment. Complete destruction of one side of the corticospinal tract completely prevented the use of the ipsilateral forepaw reaching for at least 6 months after operation. Rats which have shown no forepaw retrieval by 8 weeks were xenotransplanted with a suspension of cultured olfactory ensheathing cells derived from the mouse olfactory bulb, into the lesion site. Starting between 1 and 3 weeks, 10 rats with transplants bridging the lesion site resumed ipsilateral forepaw reaching. The histology of the lesioned rats with misplaced olfactory ensheathing cell showed no functional recovery during the 8 weeks of training.</description>

	<description>Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) derived from muscarinic receptors are a powerful tool to test causality in basic neuroscience, but are also potentially amenable to clinical translation. A major obstacle is however that the widely-used agonist clozapine-N-oxide undergoes conversion to clozapine, which penetrates the blood-brain barrier but has an unfavorable side effect profile. Perlapine has been reported to activate DREADDs at nanomolar concentrations, but is not approved for use in humans by the Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency, limiting its translational potential. Here we report that the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine, widely available in various formulations, is a full and potent agonist of the human muscarinic-receptor M4-based DREADD, facilitating clinical translation of chemogenetics to treat CNS diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Wheel-running exercise before and during gestation against acute and sensitized cocaine psychomotor-activation in offspring</title>

	<description>While animal research has consistently reported preventive effects of exercise against drug abuse vulnerability, little is known about the influence of the developmental stage during which exercise is displayed on addictive drugs responsiveness. This study aimed to determine whether prenatal exercise could attenuate acute cocaine reactivity and psychomotor sensitization in youth offspring. We used a split-plot factorial design where C57BL/6J females were randomly assigned into sedentary or exercised (wheel-running) conditions before and during gestation, the wheels being removed on gestational day 18. Offspring were weaned, gendered and individually housed on 24-28 days old. At 38-42 days old, they were tested for their acute psychomotor responsiveness to 8 mg/kg cocaine and their initiation of sensitization over 8 additional once-daily administrations, the long-term expression of sensitization occurring 30 days later. Adolescent females born from exercised mothers were much less responsive to the acute psychomotor-stimulating effect of cocaine than those born from sedentary mothers (d = 0.75, p = .02), whereas there was no evidence for such a difference in males (d = 0.34, p = .17). However, we did not find sizeable attenuating effects of prenatal exercise on the initiation and the long-term expression of the psychomotor-activating effect of cocaine, in either sex (ds varying from -0.23 to 0.39). These results suggest that prenatal exercise may induce initial protection against cocaine responsiveness in youth females, a finding that warrants further research.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dietary folic acid increases neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus of adult female rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/477448v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/477448v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Folate is an important regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis, and in utero spinal cord development. Due to the fortification of folic acid in our food, women may be receiving higher doses of synthetic folic acid than recommended. In addition, in patients with major depressive disorder, folate deficiencies, lower levels of hippocampal neurogenesis, elevated levels of homocysteine, and/or the stress hormone, cortisol, are all associated with depression. Here, we are interested in whether different doses of natural folate or synthetic folic acid diets can influence neurogenesis in the hippocampus, levels of plasma homocysteine, and serum corticosterone in adult female rats. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent dietary interventions for 29 days. Animals were randomly assigned two six different dietary groups: folate deficient + SST, low 5-MTHF, low 5-MTHF + Succinylsulfathiazole (SST), high 5-MTHF + SST, low folic acid, and high folic acid. (SST) was added to a subset of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) diets to eliminate folic acid production in the gut. Before and after dietary treatment, blood samples were collected for corticosterone and homocysteine analysis, and brain tissue was collected for neurogenesis analysis. High folic acid increased the number of immature neurons within the ventral hippocampus compared to folate deficient controls. Low 5-MTHF without SST significantly increased the number of immature neurons compared to low 5-MTHF + SST, indicating that SST interfered with elevations in neurogenesis. Low folic acid reduced plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls, but there was no significant effect of diet on serum corticosterone levels. Overall, folic acid, rather than 5-MTHF dietary treatment, influenced neurogenesis and homocysteine clearance. Furthermore, the addition of SST negated the effects of 5-MTHF to increase neurogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Risks in signal processing pipelines influencing the estimation of phase dependency for EEG-TMS</title>

	<description>Phase-dependency of cortico-spinal excitability can be researched using TMS-EEG. Due to the large artifact, non-causal filters can smear the TMS artifact and distort the phase. However, causal filters can become biased by too high filter orders or uneven pass-bands. We explored the influence of different signal processing pipelines on the estimation of the optimal phase. This exploration involved performing two simulation studies. In the first, we simulated two different phase-dependencies (uni- versus bimodal) and sought to recover them with two distinct approaches that have previously been described. In the second, we specifically explored how filter parameters (e.g., order, pass-band) biased the phase estimation. On the basis of these findings, we propose using up-to-date toolboxes, re-running scripts after software updates and performing simulation studies in parallel to safeguard the analysis pipeline of empirical studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diffusion MRI Indices and their Relation to Cognitive Impairment in Brain Aging: The updated multi-protocol approach in ADNI3</title>

	<description>Brain imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to microstructural white matter changes associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration. In its third phase, the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI3) is collecting data across multiple sites and scanners using different dMRI acquisition protocols, to better understand disease effects. It is vital to understand when data can be pooled across scanners, and how the choice of dMRI protocol affects the sensitivity of extracted measures to differences in clinical impairment. Here, we analyzed ADNI3 data from 317 participants (mean age: 75.4{+/-}7.9 years; 143 men/174 women), who were each scanned at one of 47 sites with one of six dMRI protocols using scanners from three different manufacturers. We computed four standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices including fractional anisotropy (FADTI) and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity, and one FA index based on the tensor distribution function (FATDF), in 24 bilaterally averaged white matter regions of interest. We found that protocol differences significantly affected dMRI indices, in particular FADTI. We ranked the diffusion indices for their strength of association with four clinical assessments. In addition to diagnosis, we evaluated cognitive impairment as indexed by three commonly used screening tools for detecting dementia and Alzheimers disease: the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes (CDR-sob). Using a nested random-effects model to account for protocol and site, we found that across all dMRI indices and clinical measures, the hippocampal-cingulum and fornix (crus) / stria terminalis regions most consistently showed strong associations with clinical impairment. Overall, the greatest effect sizes were detected in the hippocampal-cingulum and uncinate fasciculus for associations between axial or mean diffusivity and CDR-sob. FATDF detected robust widespread associations with clinical measures, while FADTI was the weakest of the five indices for detecting associations. Ultimately, we were able to successfully pool dMRI data from multiple acquisition protocols from ADNI3 and detect consistent and robust associations with clinical impairment and age.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Decision and navigation in mouse parietal cortex</title>

	<description>Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in navigation, in the control of movement, and in visually-guided decisions. To relate these views, we measured activity in PPC while mice performed a virtual navigation task driven by visual decisions. PPC neurons were selective for specific combinations of the animal's spatial position and heading angle. This selectivity closely predicted both the activity of individual PPC neurons, and the arrangement of their collective firing patterns in choice-selective sequences. These sequences reflected PPC encoding of the animal's navigation trajectory. Using decision as a predictor instead of heading yielded worse fits, and using it in addition to heading only slightly improved the fits. Alternative models based on visual or motor variables were inferior. We conclude that when mice use vision to choose their trajectories, a large fraction of parietal cortex activity can be predicted from simple attributes such as spatial position and heading.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: ASH1-catalyzed H3K36 methylation drives gene repression and marks H3K27me2/3-competent chromatin</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41497</link>
	<description>Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me), a widely-distributed chromatin mark, largely results from association of the lysine methyltransferase (KMT) SET-2 with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), but most eukaryotes also have additional H3K36me KMTs that act independently of RNAPII. These include the orthologs of ASH1, which are conserved in animals, plants, and fungi but whose function and control are poorly understood. We found that &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt; has just two H3K36 KMTs, ASH1 and SET-2, and were able to explore the function and distribution of each enzyme independently. While H3K36me deposited by SET-2 marks active genes, inactive genes are modified by ASH1 and its activity is critical for their repression. ASH1-marked chromatin can be further modified by methylation of H3K27, and ASH1 catalytic activity modulates the accumulation of H3K27me2/3 both positively and negatively. These findings provide new insight into ASH1 function, H3K27me2/3 establishment, and repression in facultative heterochromatin.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Targets and genomic constraints of ectopic Dnmt3b expression</title>

	<description>DNA methylation plays an essential role in mammalian genomes and expression of the responsible enzymes is tightly controlled. Deregulation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is frequently observed across cancer types, yet little is known about its ectopic genomic targets. Here, we used an inducible transgenic mouse model to delineate rules for abnormal DNMT3B targeting, as well as the constraints of its activity across different cell types. Our results explain the preferential susceptibility of certain CpG islands to aberrant methylation and point to transcriptional state and the associated chromatin landscape as the strongest predictors. Although DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are usually non-overlapping at CpG islands, H3K27me3 can transiently co-occur with DNMT3B-induced DNA methylation. Our genome-wide data combined with ultra-deep locus-specific bisulfite sequencing suggest a distributive activity of ectopically expressed Dnmt3b that leads to discordant CpG island hypermethylation and provides new insights for interpreting the cancer methylome.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive modelling of functional connectomes from structural connectomes
explores commonalities across multimodal imaging data. However, direct
application of multivariate approaches such as sparse Canonical Correlation
Analysis (sCCA) applies on the vectorised elements of functional connectivity
across subjects and it does not guarantee that the predicted models of
functional connectivity are Symmetric Positive Matrices (SPD). We suggest an
elegant solution based on the transportation of the connectivity matrices on a
Riemannian manifold, which notably improves the prediction performance of the
model. Subsequently, we construct a statistical framework to highlight brain
connections that are selected with probability well above chance and we
estimate their sCCA loadings based on a de-noising approach.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An accurate estimate of limb position is necessary for movement. Where we
localize our unseen hand after a reach depends on felt hand position, or
proprioception, but often only predicted sensory consequences based on
efference copies of motor commands are considered. Both signals should
contribute, so here we use passive training with rotated visual feedback of
hand position to prevent updates of predicted sensory consequences, but still
recalibrate proprioception. After this training we measure participants' hand
location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent
proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements as well as based on
proprioception only with robot-generated movements. The changes in hand
localization are equally large after training with robot- and self-generated
hand movements. Both motor and proprioceptive changes are only slightly smaller
as those after training with self-generated movements, confirming that
recalibrated proprioception contributes to motor learning.

cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be
important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values
of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose
relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on
the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter
values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual
parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output
uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said
parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size
and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension
reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The
methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of
neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity
analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of
$K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the
perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the
smooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter,
for each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological
dysfunction and areas of further investigation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fading of collective attention shapes the evolution of linguistic variants. (arXiv:1811.08465v1 [cs.CL])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08465</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Language change involves the competition between alternative linguistic forms
(1). Notably, the Spanish past subjunctive comes in two perfectly equivalent
variants ended in -ra or -se (2); for instance, in the sentence 'If I were
there', the verb can be equally translated to estuviera or estuviese. During a
first spontaneous process that began in the Middle Ages, the form -ra migrated
from the indicative to the subjunctive, displacing the original -se form (3-5).
A second period started with the creation of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1713,
which produced a global standardization process that enforced the official
spelling of -ra and -se as perfectly interchangeable variants (6). Time series
extracted from a massive corpus of books (7) show that this standardization
produced a boost in the declining old form -se that eventually faded, leaving
-ra as the dominant one in the present time. The time series were successfully
fitted by a low dimensional model that integrates two basic collective
behaviors: an imitative component, and a fading of collective attention to the
institutional regulation. We show that the natural scale over which collective
attention fades is inversely proportional to the frequency of use of the verbs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Diffusion geometry approach to efficiently remove electrical stimulation artifacts in intracranial electroencephalography. (arXiv:1811.08428v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical oscillations, electrophysiological activity patterns, associated
with cognitive functions and impaired in many psychiatric disorders can be
observed in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Direct cortical
stimulation (DCS) may directly target these oscillations and may serve as
therapeutic approaches to restore functional impairments. However, the presence
of electrical stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological data limits the
analysis of the effects of stimulation. Currently available methods suffer in
performance in the presence of nonstationarity inherent in biological data. Our
algorithm, Shape Adaptive Nonlocal Artifact Removal (SANAR) is based on
unsupervised manifold learning. By estimating the Euclidean median of k nearest
neighbors of each artifact in a nonlocal fashion, we obtain a faithful
representation of the artifact which is then subtracted. This approach
overcomes the challenges presented by nonstationarity. SANAR is effective in
removing stimulation artifacts in the time domain while preserving the spectral
content of the endogenous neurophysiological signal. We demonstrate the
performance in a simulated dataset as well as in human iEEG data. Using two
quantitative measures, that capture how much of information from endogenous
activity is retained, we demonstrate that SANAR's performance exceeds that of
one of the widely used approaches, independent component analysis, in the time
domain as well as the frequency domain. This approach allows for the analysis
of iEEG data, single channel or multiple channels, during DCS, a crucial step
in advancing our understanding of the effects of periodic stimulation and
developing new therapies.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40228</link>
	<description>The mechanisms by which mammalian cells recognize and epigenetically restrict viral DNA are not well defined. We used herpes simplex virus with bioorthogonally labeled genomes to detect host factors recruited to viral DNA shortly after its nuclear entry and found that the cellular IFI16, PML, and ATRX proteins colocalized with viral DNA by 15 min post infection. HSV-1 infection of ATRX&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;depleted fibroblasts resulted in elevated viral mRNA and accelerated viral DNA accumulation. Despite the early association of ATRX with vDNA, we found that initial viral heterochromatin formation is ATRX-independent. However, viral heterochromatin stability required ATRX from 4-8 h post infection. Inhibition of transcription blocked viral chromatin loss in ATRX-knockout cells; thus, ATRX is uniquely required for heterochromatin maintenance during chromatin stress. These results argue that the initial formation and the subsequent maintenance of viral heterochromatin are separable mechanisms, a concept that likely extrapolates to host cell chromatin and viral latency.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39637</link>
	<description>Reading frame maintenance is critical for accurate translation. We show that the conserved eukaryotic/archaeal protein Mbf1 acts with ribosomal proteins Rps3/uS3 and eukaryotic Asc1/RACK1 to prevent frameshifting at inhibitory CGA-CGA codon pairs in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;RPS3 &lt;/i&gt;that allow frameshifting implicate eukaryotic conserved residues near the mRNA entry site. Mbf1 and Rps3 cooperate to maintain the reading frame of stalled ribosomes, while Asc1 also mediates distinct events that result in recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex and mRNA decay. Frameshifting occurs through a +1 shift with a CGA codon in the P site and involves competition between codons entering the A site, implying that the wobble interaction of the P site codon destabilizes translation elongation. Thus, eukaryotes have evolved unique mechanisms involving both a universally conserved ribosome component and two eukaryotic-specific proteins to maintain the reading frame at ribosome stalls.</description>

	<description>Sensory navigation results from coordinated transitions between distinct behavioral programs. During chemotaxis in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; larva, the detection of positive odor gradients extends runs while negative gradients promote stops and turns. This algorithm represents a foundation for the control of sensory navigation across phyla. In the present work, we identified an olfactory descending neuron, PDM-DN, which plays a pivotal role in the organization of stops and turns in response to the detection of graded changes in odor concentrations. Artificial activation of this descending neuron induces deterministic stops followed by the initiation of turning maneuvers through head casts. Using electron microscopy, we reconstructed the main pathway that connects the PDM-DN neuron to the peripheral olfactory system and to the pre-motor circuit responsible for the actuation of forward peristalsis. Our results set the stage for a detailed mechanistic analysis of the sensorimotor conversion of graded olfactory inputs into action selection to perform goal-oriented navigation.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36769</link>
	<description>Learning the spatial organization of the environment is essential for most animals' survival. This requires the animal to derive allocentric spatial information from egocentric sensory and motor experience. The neural mechanisms underlying this transformation are mostly unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose brain circuitry is relatively simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the preglomerular complex, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the optic tectum with the spatial learning circuits in the dorsolateral pallium. While tectal topographic information was mostly eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this reliable temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate estimation of the distance between encounters, a necessary component of path-integration that enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates.</description>

	<description>Glutamate receptors are divided in two unrelated families: ionotropic (iGluR), driving synaptic transmission, and metabotropic (mGluR), which modulate synaptic strength. The present classification of GluRs is based on vertebrate proteins and has remained unchanged for over two decades. Here we report an exhaustive phylogenetic study of GluRs in metazoans. Importantly, we demonstrate that GluRs have followed different evolutionary histories in separated animal lineages. Our analysis reveals that the present organization of iGluRs into six classes does not capture the full complexity of their evolution. Instead, we propose an organization into four subfamilies and ten classes, four of which have never been previously described. Furthermore, we report a sister class to mGluR classes I-III, class IV. We show that many unreported proteins are expressed in the nervous system, and that new Epsilon receptors form functional ligand-gated ion channels. We propose an updated classification of glutamate receptors that includes our findings.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Alterations in Schizophrenia-Associated Genes Can Lead to Increased Power in Delta Oscillations</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Genome-wide association studies have implicated many ion channels in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotions can be characterized by dimensions of arousal and valence (pleasantness). While the functional brain bases of emotional arousal and valence have been actively investigated, the neuromolecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. We tested whether the opioid and dopamine systems involved in reward and motivational processes would be associated with emotional arousal and valence. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify μ-opioid receptor and type 2 dopamine receptor (MOR and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, respectively) availability in brains of 35 healthy adult females. During subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging carried out to monitor hemodynamic activity, the subjects viewed movie scenes of varying emotional content. Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region. D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R availability—here reliably quantified only in striatum—was not associated with either arousal or valence. These results suggest that emotional arousal is regulated by the MOR system, and that cerebral MOR availability influences brain activity elicited by arousing stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration; however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large NSC pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four weeks after grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to NSCs or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Superior Visual Timing Sensitivity in Auditory but not Visual World Class Drum Corps Experts</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly sub-divide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right –a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 milliseconds (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 milliseconds (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intra-modally, even when intra-modal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the nervous system’s timing sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Optimal cognitive and behavioral performance typically occurs when training conditions closely match testing conditions. This fundamental principle from learning and memory predicts greater visual test performance after visual training than after auditory training. Contrastingly, a fundamental sensory principle –superior temporal precision for auditory versus visual stimuli – predicts better visual test performance after auditory training than after visual training. We observed more precise visual timing among musical experts than among visual experts who had years of visual experience that closely matched the testing stimuli. The musicians’ superior performance suggests that shared neural events mediate the precision of auditory and visual timing. Moreover, these shared neural events provide greater temporal precision than does matching sensory modalities across training and testing contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Gas Anesthesia Impairs Peripheral Auditory Sensitivity in Barn Owls (Tyto alba)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6–11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (~2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1–1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (&lt;i&gt;Tyto alba&lt;/i&gt;; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1–1.5%), and sevoflurane (2–3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deficiency of AMPAR-Palmitoylation Aggravates Seizure Susceptibility</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic AMPAR expression controls the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. An excess of synaptic AMPARs leads to epilepsy in response to seizure-inducible stimulation. The appropriate regulation of AMPARs plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying epilepsy remain unclear. Our previous studies have revealed that a key modification of AMPAR trafficking to and from postsynaptic membranes is the reversible, posttranslational &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-palmitoylation at the C-termini of receptors. To clarify the role of palmitoylation-dependent regulation of AMPARs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient (Cys811 to Ser substitution) knock-in mice. These mutant male mice showed elevated seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced neuronal activity without impairments in synaptic transmission, gross brain structure, or behavior at the basal level. Disruption of the palmitoylation site was accompanied by upregulated GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser831, but not at Ser845, in the hippocampus and increased GluA1 protein expression in the cortex. Furthermore, GluA1 palmitoylation suppressed excessive spine enlargement above a certain size after LTP. Our findings indicate that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation can lead to hyperexcitability in the cerebrum, which negatively affects the maintenance of network stability, resulting in epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; AMPARs predominantly mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are regulated in a posttranslational, palmitoylation-dependent manner in excitatory synapses of the mammalian brain. Reversible palmitoylation dynamically controls synaptic expression and intracellular trafficking of the receptors. Here, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient knock-in mice to clarify the role of AMPAR palmitoylation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We showed that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation led to hyperexcitability, resulting in epileptic seizure. This is the first identification of a specific palmitoylated protein critical for the seizure-suppressing process. Our data also provide insight into how predicted receptors such as AMPARs can effectively preserve network stability in the brain. Furthermore, these findings help to define novel key targets for developing anti-epileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Multicomponent Neuronal Response Encodes the Larval Decision to Pupariate upon Amino Acid Starvation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Organisms need to coordinate growth with development, particularly in the context of nutrient availability. Thus, multiple ways have evolved to survive extrinsic nutrient deprivation during development. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, growth occurs during larval development. Larvae are thus critically dependent on nutritional inputs; but after critical weight, they pupariate even when starved. How nutrient availability is coupled to the internal metabolic state for the decision to pupariate needs better understanding. We had earlier identified glutamatergic interneurons in the ventral ganglion that regulate pupariation on a protein-deficient diet. Here we report that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third instar larvae (either sex) sense arginine to evaluate their nutrient environment using an amino acid transporter Slimfast. The glutamatergic interneurons integrate external protein availability with internal metabolic state through neuropeptide signals. IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated calcium release and store-operated calcium entry are essential in these glutamatergic neurons for such integration and alter neuronal function by reducing the expression of multiple ion channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Coordinating growth with development, in the context of nutrient availability is a challenge for all organisms in nature. After attainment of &quot;critical weight,&quot; insect larvae can pupariate, even in the absence of nutrition. Mechanism(s) that stimulate appropriate cellular responses and allow normal development on a nutritionally deficient diet remain to be understood. Here, we demonstrate that nutritional deprivation, in postcritical weight larvae, is sensed by special sensory neurons through an amino acid transporter that detects loss of environmental arginine. This information is integrated by glutamatergic interneurons with the internal metabolic state through neuropeptide signals. These glutamatergic interneurons require calcium-signaling-regulated expression of a host of neuronal channels to generate complex calcium signals essential for pupariation on a protein-deficient diet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Insensitivity to Pain upon Adult-Onset Deletion of Nav1.7 or Its Blockade with Selective Inhibitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10180?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10180?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Strong human genetic evidence points to an essential contribution of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 to pain sensation: loss of Nav1.7 function leads to congenital insensitivity to pain, whereas gain-of-function mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SCN9A&lt;/i&gt; gene that encodes Nav1.7 cause painful neuropathies, such as inherited erythromelalgia, a syndrome characterized by episodic spontaneous pain. Selective Nav1.7 channel blockers thus hold promise as potential painkillers with improved safety and reduced unwanted side effects compared with existing therapeutics. To determine the maximum effect of a theoretically perfectly selective Nav1.7 inhibitor, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible KO mouse model enabling genetic deletion of Nav1.7 from adult mice. Electrophysiological recordings of sensory neurons from these mice following tamoxifen injection demonstrated the loss of Nav1.7 channel current and the resulting decrease in neuronal excitability of small-diameter neurons. We found that behavioral responses to most, but surprisingly not all, modalities of noxious stimulus are abolished following adult deletion of Nav1.7, pointing toward indications where Nav1.7 blockade should be efficacious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that isoform-selective acylsulfonamide Nav1.7 inhibitors show robust analgesic and antinociceptive activity acutely after a single dose in mouse pain models shown to be Nav1.7-dependent. All experiments were done with both male and female mice. Collectively, these data expand the depth of knowledge surrounding Nav1.7 biology as it relates to pain, and provide preclinical proof of efficacy that lays a clear path toward translation for the therapeutic use of Nav1.7-selective inhibitors in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Loss-of-function mutations in the sodium channel Nav1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to pain in humans, making Nav1.7 a top target for novel pain drugs. Targeting Nav1.7 selectively has been challenging, however, in part due to uncertainties in which rodent pain models are dependent on Nav1.7. We have developed and characterized an adult-onset Nav1.7 KO mouse model that allows us to determine the expected effects of a theoretically perfect Nav1.7 blocker. Importantly, many commonly used pain models, such as mechanical allodynia after nerve injury, appear to not be dependent on Nav1.7 in the adult. By defining which models are Nav1.7 dependent, we demonstrate that selective Nav1.7 inhibitors can approximate the effects of genetic loss of function, which previously has not been directly established.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: In Vivo Expansion of Regulatory T Cells with IL-2/IL-2 Antibody Complex Protects against Transient Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to protect against ischemic stroke. However, the low frequency of Tregs restricts their clinical utility. This study investigated whether expanding the number of Tregs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with the IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex (IL-2/IL-2Ab) could improve stroke outcomes and further elaborated the mechanisms of protection in male mice. C57BL/6 mice received IL-2/IL-2Ab or isotype IgG (IsoAb) intraperitoneally for 3 d before (pretreatment) or starting 2 h after (posttreatment) 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). IL-2/IL-2Ab selectively increased the number of Tregs in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. The IL-2/IL-2Ab treatment significantly reduced infarct volume, inhibited neuroinflammation, and improved sensorimotor functions, as manifested by rotarod test and foot fault test, compared with IsoAb-treated stroke mice. Treg depletion was then achieved by diphtheria toxin (DT) injection into transgenic mice expressing the DT receptor under the control of the Foxp3 promoter (DTR mice). The depletion of Tregs completely eliminated IL-2/IL-2Ab-afforded neuroprotection. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of Tregs collected from IL-2/IL-2Ab-treated mice demonstrated more potent neuroprotection than an equal number of Tregs prepared from IsoAb-treated mice, suggesting that IL-2/IL-2Ab not only elevated Treg numbers, but also boosted their functions. Mechanistically, IL-2/IL-2Ab promoted the expression of CD39 and CD73 in expanded Tregs. CD73 deficiency diminished the protective effect of IL-2/IL-2Ab-stimulated Tregs in stroke mice. The results show that IL-2/IL-2Ab expands Tregs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and boosts their immunomodulatory function. The activation of CD39/CD73 signaling in Tregs may participate as a potential mechanism underlying IL-2/IL-2Ab-afforded neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to protect against ischemic stroke. However, the low frequency of Tregs restricts their clinical utility. This study reported that systemic administration of the IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex (IL-2/IL-2Ab) robustly and selectively expanded the number of Tregs after stroke. IL-2/IL-2Ab pretreatment or posttreatment significantly improved stroke outcomes in a rodent model of ischemic stroke. We further discovered that IL-2/IL-2Ab not only elevated Treg numbers, but also boosted their functions and enhanced the expression of CD39 and CD73. Using CD73-deficient mice, we confirmed the importance of CD73 in the protective effect of IL-2/IL-2Ab-stimulated Tregs in stroke mice. These results shed light on IL-2/IL-2Ab as a clinically feasible immune therapy to boost endogenous Treg responses and ameliorate ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Instantaneous Midbrain Control of Saccade Velocity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10156?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10156?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to interact with our environment requires the brain to transform spatially represented sensory signals into temporally encoded motor commands for appropriate control of the relevant effectors. For visually guided eye movements, or saccades, the superior colliculus (SC) is assumed to be the final stage of spatial representation, and instantaneous control of the movement is achieved through a rate code representation in the lower brain stem. We investigated whether SC activity in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta, 2 male and 1 female) also uses a dynamic rate code, in addition to the spatial representation. Noting that the kinematics of amplitude-matched movements exhibit trial-to-trial variability, we regressed instantaneous SC activity with instantaneous eye velocity and found a robust correlation throughout saccade duration. Peak correlation was tightly linked to time of peak velocity, the optimal efferent delay between SC activity and eye velocity was constant at ~12 ms both at onset and during the saccade, and SC neurons with higher firing rates exhibited stronger correlations. Moreover, the strong correlative relationship and constant efferent delay observation were preserved when eye movement profiles were substantially altered by a blink-induced perturbation. These results indicate that the rate code of individual SC neurons can control instantaneous eye velocity and argue against a serial process of spatial-to-temporal transformation. They also motivated us to consider a new framework of saccade control that does not incorporate traditionally accepted elements, such as the comparator and resettable integrator, whose neural correlates have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; All movements exhibit time-varying features that are under instantaneous control of the innervating neural command. At what stage in the brain is dynamical control present? It is well known that, in the skeletomotor system, neurons in the motor cortex use dynamical control. In the oculomotor system, in contrast, instantaneous velocity control of saccadic eye movements is not thought to be enforced until the lower brainstem. Using correlations between residual signals across trials, we show that instantaneous control of saccade velocity is present earlier in the visuo-oculomotor neuraxis, at the level of superior colliculus. The results require us to consider alternate frameworks of the neural control of saccades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Evidence Accumulation Guides Decision-Making in Unrestrained Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10143?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to manipulate neural activity with precision is an asset in uncovering neural circuits for decision-making. Diverse tools for manipulating neurons are available for mice, but their feasibility remains unclear, especially when decisions require accumulating visual evidence. For example, whether mice' decisions reflect leaky accumulation is unknown, as are the relevant/irrelevant factors that influence decisions. Further, causal circuits for visual evidence accumulation are poorly understood. To address this, we measured decisions in mice judging the fluctuating rate of a flash sequence. An initial analysis (&amp;gt;500,000 trials, 29 male and female mice) demonstrated that information throughout the 1000 ms trial influenced choice, with early information most influential. This suggests that information persists in neural circuits for ~1000 ms with minimal accumulation leak. Next, in a subset of animals, we probed strategy more extensively and found that although animals were influenced by stimulus rate, they were unable to entirely suppress the influence of stimulus brightness. Finally, we identified anteromedial (AM) visual area via retinotopic mapping and optogenetically inhibited it using JAWS. Light activation biased choices in both injected and uninjected animals, demonstrating that light alone influences behavior. By varying stimulus–response contingency while holding stimulated hemisphere constant, we surmounted this obstacle to demonstrate that AM suppression biases decisions. By leveraging a large dataset to quantitatively characterize decision-making behavior, we establish mice as suitable for neural circuit manipulation studies. Further, by demonstrating that mice accumulate visual evidence, we demonstrate that this strategy for reducing uncertainty in decision-making is used by animals with diverse visual systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To connect behaviors to their underlying neural mechanism, a deep understanding of behavioral strategy is needed. This understanding is incomplete for mice. To surmount this, we measured the outcome of &amp;gt;500,000 decisions made by 29 mice trained to judge visual stimuli and performed behavioral/optogenetic manipulations in smaller subsets. Our analyses offer new insights into mice' decision-making strategies and compares them with those of other species. We then disrupted neural activity in a candidate neural structure and examined the effect on decisions. Our findings establish mice as suitable for visual accumulation of evidence decisions. Further, the results highlight similarities in decision-making strategies across very different species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Contingencies Determine Whether Adaptation Strengthens or Weakens Normalization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10129?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10129?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental and nearly ubiquitous feature of sensory encoding is that neuronal responses are strongly influenced by recent experience, or adaptation. Theoretical and computational studies have proposed that many adaptation effects may result in part from changes in the strength of normalization signals. Normalization is a &quot;canonical&quot; computation in which a neuron's response is modulated (normalized) by the pooled activity of other neurons. Here, we test whether adaptation can alter the strength of cross-orientation suppression, or masking, a paradigmatic form of normalization evident in primary visual cortex (V1). We made extracellular recordings of V1 neurons in anesthetized male macaques and measured responses to plaid stimuli composed of two overlapping, orthogonal gratings before and after prolonged exposure to two distinct adapters. The first adapter was a plaid consisting of orthogonal gratings and led to stronger masking. The second adapter presented the same orthogonal gratings in an interleaved manner and led to weaker masking. The strength of adaptation's effects on masking depended on the orientation of the test stimuli relative to the orientation of the adapters, but was independent of neuronal orientation preference. Changes in masking could not be explained by altered neuronal responsivity. Our results suggest that normalization signals can be strengthened or weakened by adaptation depending on the temporal contingencies of the adapting stimuli. Our findings reveal an interplay between two widespread computations in cortical circuits, adaptation and normalization, that enables flexible adjustments to the structure of the environment, including the temporal relationships among sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Two fundamental features of sensory responses are that they are influenced by adaptation and that they are modulated by the activity of other nearby neurons via normalization. Our findings reveal a strong interaction between these two aspects of cortical computation. Specifically, we show that cross-orientation masking, a form of normalization, can be strengthened or weakened by adaptation depending on the temporal contingencies between sensory inputs. Our findings support theoretical proposals that some adaptation effects may involve altered normalization and offer a network-based explanation for how cortex adjusts to current sensory demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Observing Action Sequences Elicits Sequence-Specific Neural Representations in Frontoparietal Brain Regions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning new skills by watching others is important for social and motor development throughout the lifespan. Prior research has suggested that observational learning shares common substrates with physical practice at both cognitive and brain levels. In addition, neuroimaging studies have used multivariate analysis techniques to understand neural representations in a variety of domains, including vision, audition, memory, and action, but few studies have investigated neural plasticity in representational space. Therefore, although movement sequences can be learned by observing other people's actions, a largely unanswered question in neuroscience is how experience shapes the representational space of neural systems. Here, across a sample of male and female participants, we combined pretraining and posttraining fMRI sessions with 6 d of observational practice to determine whether the observation of action sequences elicits sequence-specific representations in human frontoparietal brain regions and the extent to which these representations become more distinct with observational practice. Our results showed that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained, sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar to that previously shown following physical practice). Therefore, on a more fine-grained neural level than demonstrated previously, our findings reveal how the representational structure of frontoparietal cortex maps visual information onto motor circuits in order to enhance motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning by watching others is a cornerstone in the development of expertise and skilled behavior. However, it remains unclear how visual signals are mapped onto motor circuits for such learning to occur. Here, we show that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained, sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar to that previously shown following physical practice). More generally, these findings demonstrate how motor circuit involvement in the perception of action sequences shows high fidelity to prior work, which focused on physical performance of action sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Aggrecan Directs Extracellular Matrix-Mediated Neuronal Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the adult brain, the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences recovery after injury, susceptibility to mental disorders, and is in general a strong regulator of neuronal plasticity. The proteoglycan aggrecan is a core component of the condensed ECM structures termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), and the specific role of PNNs on neural plasticity remains elusive. Here, we genetically targeted the &lt;i&gt;Acan&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding for aggrecan using a novel animal model. This allowed for conditional and targeted loss of aggrecan &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, which ablated the PNN structure and caused a shift in the population of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons toward a high plasticity state. Selective deletion of the &lt;i&gt;Acan&lt;/i&gt; gene in the visual cortex of male adult mice reinstated juvenile ocular dominance plasticity, which was mechanistically identical to critical period plasticity. Brain-wide targeting improved object recognition memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The study provides the first direct evidence of aggrecan as the main functional constituent and orchestrator of perineuronal nets (PNNs), and that loss of PNNs by aggrecan removal induces a permanent state of critical period-like plasticity. Loss of aggrecan ablates the PNN structure, resulting in invoked juvenile plasticity in the visual cortex and enhanced object recognition memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motivation enhances memory by increasing hippocampal engagement during encoding. However, whether such increased hippocampal activation reflects encoding of the value of highly rewarding events per se is less understood. Here, using a monetary incentive encoding task with a novel manipulation, we tested in humans whether the hippocampus represents abstract reward value, independent of perceptual content. During functional MRI scanning, men and women studied object pairs, each preceded by a monetary reward cue indicating the amount of money they would receive if they successfully remembered the object pair at test. Reward cues varied on both the level of reward (penny, dime, and dollar) and visual form (picture or word) across trials to dissociate hippocampal responses to reward value from those reflecting the perceptual properties of the cues. Behaviorally, participants remembered pairs associated with the high reward (dollar) more often than pairs associated with lower rewards. Neural pattern-similarity analysis revealed that hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activation patterns discriminated between cues of different value regardless of their visual form, and that hippocampal discrimination of value was most pronounced in participants who showed the greatest behavioral sensitivity to reward. Strikingly, hippocampal patterns were most distinct for reward cues that differed in value but had similar visual appearance, consistent with theoretical proposals of hippocampal-pattern differentiation of competing representations. Our data illustrate how contextual representations within the hippocampus go beyond space and time to include information about the motivational salience of events, with hippocampal reward coding tracking the motivational impact on later memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motivation, such as the promise of future rewards, enhances hippocampal engagement during encoding and promotes successful retention of events associated with valuable rewards. However, whether the hippocampus explicitly encodes reward value, dissociable from sensory information, is unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus forms abstract representation of valuable rewards, encoding conceptual rather than perceptual information about the motivational context of individual events. Reward representation within the hippocampus is associated with preferential retention of high-value events in memory. Furthermore, we show that hippocampal-pattern differentiation serves to emphasize differences between visually similar events with distinct motivational salience. Collectively, these findings indicate that hippocampal contextual representations enable individuals to distinguish the motivational value of events, leading to prioritized encoding of significant memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep and Wakefulness Are Controlled by Ventral Medial Midbrain/Pons GABAergic Neurons in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep–wake behavior is controlled by a wide range of neuronal populations in the mammalian brain. Although the ventral midbrain/pons (VMP) area is suggested to participate in sleep–wake regulation, the neuronal mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, we found that nonspecific cell ablation or selective ablation of GABAergic neurons by expressing diphtheria toxin fragment A in the VMP in male mice induced a large increase in wakefulness that lasted at least 4 weeks. In contrast, selective ablation of dopaminergic neurons in the VMP had little effect on wakefulness. Chemogenetic inhibition of VMP GABAergic neurons also markedly increased wakefulness. The wake-promoting effect of the VMP GABAergic neuron ablation or inhibition was attenuated to varying degrees by the administration of dopamine D1 or D2/3 receptor antagonists and abolished by the administration of both antagonists together. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of VMP GABAergic neurons very strongly increased slow-wave sleep and reduced wakefulness. These findings suggest that VMP GABAergic neurons regulate dopaminergic actions in the sleep–wake behavior of mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current understanding of the neuronal mechanisms and populations that regulate sleep–wake behavior is incomplete. Here, we identified a GABAergic ventral midbrain/pons area that is necessary for controlling the daily amount of sleep and wakefulness in mice. We also found that these inhibitory neurons control wakefulness by suppressing dopaminergic systems. Surprisingly, activation of these neurons strongly induced slow-wave sleep while suppressing wakefulness. Our study reveals a new brain mechanism critical for sleep–wake regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonlinear Lateral Interactions in V1 Population Responses Explained by a Contrast Gain Control Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do cortical responses to local image elements combine to form a spatial pattern of population activity in primate V1? Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging, which measures summed membrane potential activity, to examine the rules that govern lateral interactions between the representations of two small local-oriented elements in macaque (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) V1. We find strong subadditive and mostly orientation-independent interactions for nearby elements [2–4 mm interelement cortical distance (IED)] that gradually become linear at larger separations (&amp;gt;6 mm IED). These results are consistent with a population gain control model describing nonlinear V1 population responses to single oriented elements. However, because of the membrane potential-to-spiking accelerating nonlinearity, the model predicts supra-additive lateral interactions of spiking responses for intermediate separations at a range of locations between the two elements, consistent with some prior facilitatory effects observed in electrophysiology and psychophysics. Overall, our results suggest that population-level lateral interactions in V1 are primarily explained by a simple orientation-independent contrast gain control mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Interactions between representations of simple visual elements such as oriented edges in primary visual cortex (V1) are thought to contribute to our ability to easily integrate contours and segment surfaces, but the mechanisms that govern these interactions are primarily unknown. Our study provides novel evidence that lateral interactions at the population level are governed by a simple contrast gain–control mechanism, and we show how this divisive gain–control mechanism can give rise to apparently facilitatory spiking responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The function of the human hippocampus is normally investigated by experimental manipulation of discrete events. Less is known about what triggers hippocampal activity during more naturalistic, continuous experience. We hypothesized that the hippocampus would be sensitive to the occurrence of event boundaries, that is, moments in time identified by observers as a transition between events. To address this, we analyzed functional MRI data from two groups: one (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 253, 131 female) who viewed an 8.5 min film and another (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15, 6 female) who viewed a 120 min film. We observed a strong hippocampal response at boundaries defined by independent observers, which was modulated by boundary salience (the number of observers that identified each boundary). In the longer film, there were sufficient boundaries to show that this modulation remained after covarying out a large number of perceptual factors. This hypothesis-driven approach was complemented by a data-driven approach, in which we identified hippocampal events as moments in time with the strongest hippocampal activity. The correspondence between these hippocampal events and event boundaries was highly significant, revealing that the hippocampal response is not only sensitive, but also specific to event boundaries. We conclude that event boundaries play a key role in shaping hippocampal activity during encoding of naturalistic events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent years have seen the field of human neuroscience research transitioning from experiments with simple stimuli to the study of more complex and naturalistic experience. Nonetheless, our understanding of the function of many brain regions, such as the hippocampus, is based primarily on the study of brief, discrete events. As a result, we know little of what triggers hippocampal activity in real-life settings when we are exposed to a continuous stream of information. When does the hippocampus &quot;decide&quot; to respond during the encoding of naturalistic experience? We reveal here that hippocampal activity measured by fMRI during film watching is both sensitive and specific to event boundaries, identifying a potential mechanism whereby event boundaries shape experience by modulation of hippocampal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Unilateral, 3D Arm Movement Kinematics Are Encoded in Ipsilateral Human Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is increasing evidence that the hemisphere ipsilateral to a moving limb plays a role in planning and executing movements. However, the exact relationship between cortical activity and ipsilateral limb movements is uncertain. We sought to determine whether 3D arm movement kinematics (speed, velocity, and position) could be decoded from cortical signals recorded from the hemisphere ipsilateral to the moving limb. By having invasively monitored patients perform unilateral reaches with each arm, we also compared the encoding of contralateral and ipsilateral limb kinematics from a single cortical hemisphere. In four motor-intact human patients (three male, one female) implanted with electrocorticography electrodes for localization of their epileptic foci, we decoded 3D movement kinematics of both arms with accuracies above chance. Surprisingly, the spatial and spectral encoding of contralateral and ipsilateral limb kinematics was similar, enabling cross-prediction of kinematics between arms. These results clarify our understanding that the ipsilateral hemisphere robustly contributes to motor execution and supports that the information of complex movements is more bihemispherically represented in humans than has been previously understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although limb movements are traditionally understood to be driven by the cortical hemisphere contralateral to a moving limb, movement-related neural activity has also been found in the ipsilateral hemisphere. This study provides the first demonstration that 3D arm movement kinematics can be decoded from human electrocorticographic signals ipsilateral to the moving limb. Surprisingly, the spatial and spectral encoding of contralateral and ipsilateral limb kinematics was similar. The finding that specific kinematics are encoded in the ipsilateral hemisphere demonstrates that the ipsilateral hemisphere contributes to the execution of unilateral limb movements, improving our understanding of motor control. Additionally, the bihemisheric representation of voluntary movements has implications for the development of neuroprosthetic systems for reaching and for neurorehabilitation strategies following cortical injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Specificity of Primate Amygdalar Pathways to Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala projects to hippocampus in pathways through which affective or social stimuli may influence learning and memory. We investigated the still unknown amygdalar termination patterns and their postsynaptic targets in hippocampus from system to synapse in rhesus monkeys of both sexes. The amygdala robustly innervated the stratum lacunosum-moleculare layer of cornu ammonis fields and uncus anteriorly. Sparser terminations in posterior hippocampus innervated the radiatum and pyramidal layers at the prosubicular/CA1 juncture. The terminations, which were larger than other afferents in the surrounding neuropil, position the amygdala to influence hippocampal input anteriorly, and its output posteriorly. Most amygdalar boutons (76–80%) innervated spines of excitatory hippocampal neurons, and most of the remaining innervated presumed inhibitory neurons, identified by morphology and label with parvalbumin or calretinin, which distinguished nonoverlapping neurochemical classes of hippocampal inhibitory neurons. In CA1, amygdalar axons innervated some calretinin neurons, which disinhibit pyramidal neurons. By contrast, in CA3 the amygdala innervated both calretinin and parvalbumin neurons; the latter strongly inhibit nearby excitatory neurons. In CA3, amygdalar pathways also made closely spaced dual synapses on excitatory neurons. The strong excitatory synapses in CA3 may facilitate affective context representations and trigger sharp-wave ripples associated with memory consolidation. When the amygdala is excessively activated during traumatic events, the specialized innervation of excitatory neurons and the powerful parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in CA3 may allow the suppression of activity of nearby neurons that receive weaker nonamygdalar input, leading to biased passage of highly charged affective stimuli and generalized fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Strong pathways from the amygdala targeted the anterior hippocampus, and more weakly its posterior sectors, positioned to influence a variety of emotional and cognitive functions. In hippocampal field CA1, the amygdala innervated some calretinin neurons, which disinhibit excitatory neurons. By contrast, in CA3 the amygdala innervated calretinin as well as some of the powerful parvalbumin inhibitory neurons and may help balance the activity of neural ensembles to allow social interactions, learning, and memory. These results suggest that when the amygdala is hyperactive during emotional upheaval, it strongly activates excitatory hippocampal neurons and parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in CA3, which can suppress nearby neurons that receive weaker input from other sources, biasing the passage of stimuli with high emotional import and leading to generalized fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A photomicrograph of HeLa cells expressing amino acids 1‐149 of the protein KCTD7 with a mutation (L108M) seen in patients who have progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). The mutant protein has an HA tag that has been stained with red fluorescence to localize the protein, revealing red filaments in the nucleus and in the surrounding cytoplasm. Filament structures are altered by this L108M mutation in the BTB domain of KCTD7. The nucleus of each cell is stained blue.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Fingolimod enhances the efficacy of delayed alteplase administration in acute ischemic stroke by promoting anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25352?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25352?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;84:725–736&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: KCTD7 deficiency defines a distinct neurodegenerative disorder with a conserved autophagy‐lysosome defect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25351?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25351?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several small case series identified &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;NBEA&lt;/i&gt; is a candidate gene for autism, and de novo variants have been reported in neurodevelopmental disease (NDD) cohorts. However, &lt;i&gt;NBEA&lt;/i&gt; has not been rigorously evaluated as a disease gene, and associated phenotypes have not been delineated. We identified 24 de novo &lt;i&gt;NBEA&lt;/i&gt; variants in patients with NDD, establishing &lt;i&gt;NBEA&lt;/i&gt; as an NDD gene. Most patients had epilepsy with onset in the first few years of life, often characterized by generalized seizure types, including myoclonic and atonic seizures. Our data show a broader phenotypic spectrum than previously described, including a myoclonic‐astatic epilepsy–like phenotype in a subset of patients.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Development of a cerebrovascular magnetic resonance imaging biomarker for cognitive aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25346?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to measure the association of systemic vascular health with brain health after accounting for the impact of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies. We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health–related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged ≥ 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population‐based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health–related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology–related changes has great utility for cognitive aging.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Disease progression and outcome measures in spinobulbar muscular atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25345?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25345?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive disease with weakness of bulbar and extremity muscles. There is no curative treatment for the disease, but several clinical trials have been conducted over the past years. The results from these trials have uncovered a great need to develop quantitative, reliable outcome measures. In this study, we prospectively investigated disease progression over 18 months in 29 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA, using quantitative outcome measures, including Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used MRI to assess changes in muscle fat content and stationary dynamometry to assess changes in muscle strength. Disease progression was also investigated with the SBMA functional rating scale, bulbar rating scale, 6‐minute walk test, and blood samples, among others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean muscle fat content, muscle strength in knee extensors, handgrip strength, walking distance, and creatinine levels changed significantly. Mean muscle fat content increased by 2 ± 1.25%, and knee extension strength decreased from 83 ± 60 to 76 ± 56Nm, handgrip strength from 31 ± 13 to 29 ± 13kg, walking distance from 362 ± 216 to 336 ± 219m, and creatinine level from 58 ± 21 to 54 ± 20 μmol/l. Functional rating scores did not change.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study demonstrates a slow and steady disease progression in SBMA. Dixon MRI detected increases in muscle fat content in all investigated muscles and is therefore a suitable candidate for an outcome measure in natural history or treatment studies in SBMA. The 6‐minute walk test and handgrip strength also seem to be reliable outcome measures for SBMA. Ann Neurol 2018;84:762–773&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Relative neuron loss in hippocampal sclerosis of aging and Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25344?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25344?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To characterize the pattern of neuron loss in hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS‐Aging) and age‐related diseases and to evaluate its contribution to cognitive impairment in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants (n = 1,361) came from longitudinal observational studies of aging at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Relative neuron loss in the hippocampus of HS‐Aging was measured using unbiased stereological methods. Transactive response DNA‐binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP‐43) proteinopathy, a putative marker of HS‐Aging, was assessed. Clinical and cognitive data were analyzed using parametric statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐three cases had HS‐Aging (6.8%), 8 cases had “pure” HS‐Aging, and 37 cases had comorbid intermediate or high Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (i/h ADNC). Relative neuron loss (ratio of neuron number in hippocampal subfield CA1 to the neuron number in parahippocampal gyrus) was 0.15 for HS‐Aging; this was significantly lower than 0.64 for i/h ADNC and 0.66 for control cases (Kruskal‐Wallis test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0003, respectively). TDP‐43 proteinopathy was present in 92.4% of HS‐Aging cases, higher than that in i/h ADNC (52%) and control (25%) cases. Pure HS‐Aging cases were more likely to have cognitive impairment in the memory domain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative neuron loss in the hippocampus compared to the parahippocampus gyrus may be useful in distinguishing HS‐Aging in the context of comorbid ADNC. HS‐Aging contributes to cognitive impairment, which phenotypically resembles AD dementia. TDP proteinopathy is a frequent comorbidity in HS‐Aging and may contribute to cognitive impairment to a modest degree. Ann Neurol 2018;84:749–761&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Etiologic diagnosis is uncertain in 35% to 50% of patients with encephalitis, despite its substantial global prevalence and disease burden. We report on 2 adult female patients with fatal leukoencephalitis associated with human pegivirus‐1 (HPgV‐1) brain infection. Neuroimaging showed inflammatory changes in cerebral white matter. Brain‐derived HPgV‐1 RNA sequences clustered phylogenetically with other pegiviruses despite an 87‐nucleotide deletion in the viral nonstructural (NS)2 gene. Neuropathology disclosed lymphocyte infiltration and gliosis predominantly in brain white matter. HPgV‐1 NS5A antigen was detected in lymphocytes as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. HPgV‐1 neuroadaptation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive leukoencephalitis in humans. Ann Neurol 2018;84:789–795&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25342?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC‐ICH) has a better outcome compared to ICH associated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA‐ICH) is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review and individual patient data meta‐analysis of cohort studies comparing clinical and radiological outcomes between NOAC‐ICH and VKA‐ICH patients. The primary outcome measure was 30‐day all‐cause mortality. All outcomes were assessed in multivariate regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, ICH location, and intraventricular hemorrhage extension.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 7 eligible studies comprising 219 NOAC‐ICH and 831 VKA‐ICH patients (mean age = 77 years, 52.5% females). The 30‐day mortality was similar between NOAC‐ICH and VKA‐ICH (24.3% vs 26.5%; hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67–1.31). However, in multivariate analyses adjusting for potential confounders, NOAC‐ICH was associated with lower admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (linear regression coefficient = −2.83, 95% CI = −5.28 to −0.38), lower likelihood of severe stroke (NIHSS &amp;gt; 10 points) on admission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.30–0.84), and smaller baseline hematoma volume (linear regression coefficient = −0.24, 95% CI = −0.47 to −0.16). The two groups did not differ in the likelihood of baseline hematoma volume &amp;lt; 30cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.81–1.62), hematoma expansion (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.63–1.48), in‐hospital mortality (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.49–1.11), functional status at discharge (common OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57–1.07), or functional status at 3 months (common OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.75–1.43).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although functional outcome at discharge, 1 month, or 3 months was comparable after NOAC‐ICH and VKA‐ICH, patients with NOAC‐ICH had smaller baseline hematoma volumes and less severe acute stroke syndromes. Ann Neurol 2018;84:702–712&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study observed a 2‐fold greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in relation to the β2‐adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol and a markedly lower risk of PD for the β2‐adrenoreceptor agonist salbutamol. We examined whether confounding by clinical indication for these medications, that is, tremor and smoking‐related pulmonary conditions, explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large, population‐based case–control study of United States Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 with diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and prescription data (48,295 incident PD cases, 52,324 controls), we examined the risk of PD in relation to use of selected β antagonists (propranolol, carvedilol, metoprolol), the β2 agonist salbutamol, and other medications used for the same clinical indications (primidone, inhaled corticosteroids). We adjusted for demographics, smoking, and overall use of medical care. We then examined the effect of also adjusting for clinical indication and applying medication exposure lagging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propranolol appeared to increase PD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.31–3.96). When we adjusted for tremor or abnormal involuntary movement prior to the PD diagnosis/reference date and lagged propranolol exposure, the association was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.80–1.18). Primidone, also used for tremor, was similarly sensitive to this adjustment and lagging. β Antagonists not indicated for tremor appeared to reduce PD risk (carvedilol: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.73–0.81; metoprolol: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91–0.97) and were insensitive to adjustment for indications and lagging. Neither salbutamol nor inhaled corticosteroids were consistently associated with PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;β2‐adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists do not appear to alter PD risk. Ann Neurol 2018;84:691–701&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A for Treating Cramps in Diabetic Neuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25340?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25340?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle cramps occur in &amp;gt;50% of diabetic patients and reduce the quality of life. No effective treatment is available. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (BTX‐A) injections for treating cramps in diabetic patients with neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single‐center, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled perspective study investigated the efficacy and safety of BTX‐A intramuscular injection for treating calf or foot cramps refractory to common pharmacological drugs. Fifty diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy and cramps were randomly assigned to 2 matched groups. BTX‐A (100 or 30 units) or saline was injected on each side into the gastrocnemius or the small flexor foot muscles. Changes in pain intensity (primary outcome) and cramp frequency were evaluated over the course of 20 weeks after BTX‐A administration. Cramp interference in daily life and the electrophysiological cramp threshold frequency were also measured. The treatment was repeated 5 months after first injection in 19 responders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All outcome measures improved significantly after BTX‐A compared with placebo. The changes with respect to baseline were already significant after 1 week and persisted up to week 14. Only 5 of 25 (20%) patients were nonresponders (&amp;lt;50% decrease of the primary outcome). The responses to a second BTX‐A injection provided results similar to the first administration. Mild pain at the injection site (4/25 cases) was the only adverse event, and it disappeared within 2 to 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local BTX‐A infiltration is an efficacious and safe procedure for obtaining a sustained amelioration of muscle cramps associated with diabetic neuropathy. Ann Neurol 2018;84:682–690&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: ETFDH Mutations and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide Homeostasis Disturbance Are Essential for Developing Riboflavin‐Responsive Multiple Acyl–Coenzyme A Dehydrogenation Deficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25338?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25338?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin‐responsive multiple acyl–coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (RR‐MADD) is an inherited fatty acid metabolism disorder mainly caused by genetic defects in electron transfer flavoprotein–ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF:QO). The variant ETF:QO protein folding deficiency, which can be corrected by therapeutic dosage of riboflavin supplement, has been identified in HEK‐293 cells and is believed to be the molecular mechanism of this disease. To verify this hypothesis in vivo, we generated &lt;i&gt;Etfdh&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;(h)A84T&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sup&gt; knockin (KI) mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissues from these mice as well as muscle biopsies and fibroblasts from 7 RR‐MADD patients were used to examine the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) concentration and ETF:QO protein amount.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the homozygous KI mice (&lt;i&gt;Etfdh&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;(h)A84T/(h)A84T&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sup&gt;, KI/KI) were initially normal. After being given a high‐fat and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–deficient (HF‐B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D) diet for 5 weeks, they developed weight loss, movement ability defects, lipid storage in muscle and liver, and elevated serum acyl‐carnitine levels, which are clinically and biochemically similar to RR‐MADD patients. Both ETF:QO protein and FAD concentrations were significantly decreased in tissues of HF‐B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D–KI/KI mice and in cultured fibroblasts from RR‐MADD patients. After riboflavin treatment, ETF:QO protein increased in proportion to elevated FAD concentrations, but not related to mRNA levels. These results were further confirmed in cultured fibroblasts from RR‐MADD patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we successfully developed a RR‐MADD mice model and confirmed that FAD homeostasis disturbances played a crucial role on the pathomechanism of RR‐MADD in this mouse model and culture cells from patients. Supplementation of riboflavin may stabilize variant ETF:QO protein by rebuilding FAD homeostasis. Ann Neurol 2018;84:667–681&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Plasma Amyloid as Prescreener for the Earliest Alzheimer Pathological Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25334?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25334?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the association of plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, and total tau (tTau) with the presence of Alzheimer pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 248 subjects with SCD (61 ± 9 years, 42% female, Mini‐Mental State Examination = 28 ± 2) from the SCIENCe project and Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Subjects were dichotomized as amyloid abnormal by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Baseline plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and tTau were measured using Simoa technology. Associations between plasma levels and amyloid status were assessed using logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Association of plasma levels with risk of clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐seven (23%) subjects were CSF‐amyloid abnormal. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and plasma Abeta42 alone, but not tTau, identified abnormal CSF‐amyloid status (plasma ratio: area under the curve [AUC] = 77%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 69–84%; plasma Abeta42: AUC = 66%, 95% CI: 58–74%). Combining plasma ratio with age and apolipoprotein E resulted in AUC = 83% (95% CI = 77–89%). The Youden cutoff of the plasma ratio gave a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 75%, and applying this as a prescreener would reduce the number of lumbar punctures by 51%. Using PET as outcome, a comparable reduction in number of PET scans would be achieved when applying the plasma ratio as prescreener. In addition, low plasma ratio was associated with clinical progression to MCI or dementia (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4–2.3).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio has potential as a prescreener to identify Alzheimer pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with SCD. Ann Neurol 2018;84:656–666&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Prevalence of amyloid‐β pathology in distinct variants of primary progressive aphasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25333?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25333?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity, defined by positron emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and/or neuropathological examination, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a meta‐analysis with individual participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid‐β pathology (CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 status was determined using generalized estimating equation models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐β positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86%) than in nfvPPA (20%) or svPPA (16%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid‐β positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10% at age 50 years to 27% at age 80 years, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and svPPA (from 6% at age 50 years to 32% at age 80 years, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), but not in lvPPA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE ε4 carriers were more often amyloid‐β positive (58.0%) than noncarriers (35.0%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration–TDP‐43 in svPPA (80%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration–TDP‐43/tau in nfvPPA (64%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that the current PPA classification system helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when interpreting amyloid‐β biomarkers in PPA patients.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25327?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify causes of the autosomal‐recessive malformation, diencephalic‐mesencephalic junction dysplasia (DMJD) syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight families with DMJD were studied by whole‐exome or targeted sequencing, with detailed clinical and radiological characterization. Patient‐derived induced pluripotent stem cells were derived into neural precursor and endothelial cells to study gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All patients showed biallelic mutations in the nonclustered &lt;i&gt;protocadherin‐12&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PCDH12&lt;/i&gt;) gene. The characteristic clinical presentation included progressive microcephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, psychomotor disability, epilepsy, and axial hypotonia with variable appendicular spasticity. Brain imaging showed brainstem malformations and with frequent thinned corpus callosum with punctate brain calcifications, reflecting expression of &lt;i&gt;PCDH12&lt;/i&gt; in neural and endothelial cells. These cells showed lack of &lt;i&gt;PCDH12&lt;/i&gt; expression and impaired neurite outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMJD patients have biallelic mutations in &lt;i&gt;PCDH12&lt;/i&gt; and lack of protein expression. These patients present with characteristic microcephaly and abnormalities of white matter tracts. Such pathogenic variants predict a poor outcome as a result of brainstem malformation and evidence of white matter tract defects, and should be added to the phenotypic spectrum associated with &lt;i&gt;PCDH12&lt;/i&gt;‐related conditions.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy in Childhood: A Nationwide Natural History Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25326?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25326?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most frequent heritable muscular dystrophies, with a large variety in age at onset and disease severity. The natural history and molecular characteristics of FSHD in childhood are incompletely understood. Our objective is to clinically and genetically characterize FSHD in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a nationwide, single‐investigator, natural history study on FSHD in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple‐source recruitment resulted in 32 patients with FSHD (0–17 years), leading to an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 children in The Netherlands. This series of 32 children with FSHD revealed a heterogeneous phenotype and genotype in childhood. The phenotypic hallmarks of FSHD in childhood are: facial weakness with normal or only mildly affected motor performance, decreased functional exercise capacity (6‐minute walk test), lumbar hyperlordosis, and increased echo intensity on muscle ultrasonography. In addition, pain and fatigue were frequent and patients experienced a lower quality of life compared to healthy peers. In contrast to the literature on early‐onset FSHD, systemic features such as hearing loss and retinal and cardiac abnormalities were infrequent and subclinical, and epilepsy and intellectual disability were absent. Genotypically, patients had a mean D4Z4 repeat array of 5 units (range, 2–9), and 14% of the mutations were de novo.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSHD in childhood is more prevalent than previously known and the genotype resembles classic FSHD. Importantly, FSHD mainly affects functional exercise capacity and quality of life in children. As such, these results are paramount for counseling, clinical management, and stratification in clinical research. Ann Neurol 2018;84:635–645&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain-Inspired Stigmergy Learning. (arXiv:1811.08210v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08210</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08210</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stigmergy has proved its great superiority in terms of distributed control,
robustness and adaptability, thus being regarded as an ideal solution for
large-scale swarm control problems. Based on new discoveries on astrocytes in
regulating synaptic transmission in the brain, this paper has mapped stigmergy
mechanism into the interaction between synapses and investigated its
characteristics and advantages. Particularly, we have divided the interaction
between synapses which are not directly connected into three phases and
proposed a stigmergic learning model. In this model, the state change of a
stigmergy agent will expand its influence to affect the states of others. The
strength of the interaction is determined by the level of neural activity as
well as the distance between stigmergy agents. Inspired by the morphological
and functional changes in astrocytes during environmental enrichment, it is
likely that the regulation of distance between stigmergy agents plays a
critical role in the stigmergy learning process. Simulation results have
verified its importance and indicated that the well-regulated distance between
stigmergy agents can help to obtain stigmergy learning gain.

	<description>Recombination, the exchange of information between different genetic polymer strands, is of fundamental importance in biology for genome maintenance and genetic diversification mediated by dedicated recombinase enzymes. Here, we describe a pervasive non-enzymatic capacity for recombination (and ligation) in random-sequence genetic oligomer pools. Specifically, we examine random and semi-random eicosamer (N&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) pools of RNA, DNA and the unnatural genetic polymers ANA (arabino-), HNA (hexitol-) and AtNA (altritol-nucleic acids). While DNA, ANA and HNA pools proved inert, RNA and AtNA pools displayed diverse modes of spontaneous intermolecular recombination, connecting recombination mechanistically to the vicinal ring cis-diol configuration shared by RNA and AtNA. Thus, the chemical constitution that renders both susceptible to hydrolysis emerges as the fundamental determinant of an innate capacity for recombination, which is shown to enable a concomitant increase in compositional, informational and structural pool complexity and hence evolutionary potential.</description>

	<description>The mechanisms underlying axon regeneration in mature neurons are relevant to the understanding of normal nervous system maintenance and for developing therapeutic strategies for injury. Here, we report novel pathways in axon regeneration, identified by extending our previous function-based screen using the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;mechanosensory neuron axotomy model. We identify an unexpected role of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) synthesizing enzyme, NMAT-2/NMNAT, in axon regeneration. NMAT-2 inhibits axon regrowth via cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. NMAT-2 enzymatic activity is required to repress regrowth. Further, we find differential requirements for proteins in membrane contact site, components and regulators of the extracellular matrix, membrane trafficking, microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, the conserved Kelch-domain protein IVNS-1, and the orphan transporter MFSD-6 in axon regrowth. Identification of these new pathways expands our understanding of the molecular basis of axonal injury response and regeneration.</description>

	<description>How does our brain give rise to passive or active defensive responses when we are confronted with threats? In a recent study in Cell, Terburg, Scheggia and colleagues (Terburg et al., 2018) show that, in both humans and rats, a pathway originating from the amygdala can help suppress passive responses, thereby facilitating active responses to imminent threats.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deepbinner: Demultiplexing barcoded Oxford Nanopore reads with deep convolutional neural networks</title>

Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zSKzkzc7_uc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To transmit information efficiently in a changing environment, the retina adapts to visual contrast by adjusting its gain, latency and mean response. Additionally, the temporal frequency selectivity, or bandwidth changes to encode the absolute intensity when the stimulus environment is noisy, and intensity differences when noise is low. We show that the On pathway of On-Off retinal amacrine and ganglion cells is required to change temporal bandwidth but not other adaptive properties. This remarkably specific adaptive mechanism arises from differential effects of contrast on the On and Off pathways. We analyzed a biophysical model fit only to a cell’s membrane potential, and verified pharmacologically that it accurately revealed the two pathways. We conclude that changes in bandwidth arise mostly from differences in synaptic threshold in the two pathways, rather than synaptic release dynamics as has previously been proposed to underlie contrast adaptation. Different efficient codes are selected by different thresholds in two independently adapting neural pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sklOjZc6RaM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Optogenetic dissection of temporal dynamics of amygdala-striatal interplay during risk/reward decision making</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc show distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50-12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA&amp;amp;cenveo_unknown_entity_wingdings_F0E0;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4-7 s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Amygdala projections to the nucleus accumbens form a neural circuit that has been implicated in guiding risk-related decision making, and dysfunction in this circuitry is thought to underlie aberrant decision making observed a variety of psychiatric illnesses. The present study used temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition to identify how activity in amygdala inputs to the accumbens, during different phases of the decision process, promotes optimal decision making. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms through which these circuits contribute to normal and abnormal decisions involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Asymmetrical relationship between prediction and control during visuomotor adaptation</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Current theories suggest that the ability to control the body and to predict its associated sensory consequences is key for skilled motor behavior. It is also suggested that these abilities need both be updated when the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences is altered. Here we challenge this view by investigating the transfer of adaptation to rotated visual feedback between one task in which human participants had to control a cursor with their hand in order to track a moving target, and another in which they had to predict with their eyes the visual consequences of their hand movement on the cursor. Hand and eye tracking performances were evaluated respectively through cursor-target and gaze-cursor distance. Results reveal a striking dissociation: although prior adaptation of hand tracking greatly facilitates eye tracking, adaptation of eye tracking does not transfer to hand tracking. We conclude that although the update of control is associated with the update of prediction, prediction can be updated independently of control. To account for this pattern of results we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control. Although a joint update of prediction and control seemed mandatory for success in our hand tracking task, the update of control was only facultative for success in our eye tracking task. More generally those results promote the view that prediction and control are mediated by separate neural processes and suggest that people can learn to predict movement consequences without necessarily promoting their ability to control these movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Current theories suggest that accurately predicting the sensory consequences of one’s actions is central for perception, awareness of action, and motor learning. In the latter case, it is assumed that prediction errors are used to train the controller that transforms our desired sensory consequences into motor commands. Here we show that, following exposure to biased hand visual feedback, people can update their ability to predict visual consequences of hand movements without necessarily improving their ability to control these movements. This work challenges the view that the joint update of prediction and control is mandatory when facing a change in the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences. Instead we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans,&lt;/i&gt; RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Simple head orientation behaviors in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; provide an opportunity to dissect sensorimotor integration at the cellular and subcellular levels. We describe a single interneuron that coordinates posture, sensation, and movement to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli and direct motor output to guide navigation behavior. Our findings underscore the fundamental role of neural mechanisms for integrating sensory input into ongoing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Plant reproduction requires long-distance growth of a pollen tube to fertilize the female gametophyte. Prior reports suggested that mutations altering synthesis of flavonoids, plant specialized metabolites that include flavonols and anthocyanins, impair pollen development in several species, but the mechanism by which flavonols enhanced fertility was not defined. Here, we...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/wS1zmd0q8-U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coding with transient trajectories in recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1811.07592v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07592</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07592</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Following a stimulus, the neural response typically strongly varies in time
and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical
population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have
argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative
about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through
dynamics. Yet an understanding of the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a
population code based on transient trajectories is still missing. Here we show
that a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of recurrently connected
units exhibits the properties needed for transient coding. We first identify a
general criterion that distinguishes two classes of networks depending on
properties of the connectivity matrix: networks in which all inputs lead to
weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs elicit
strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal output
states during the dynamics. For the second class of networks, we provide a
procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the corresponding
readouts for arbitrary connectivity matrices. We then exploit our approach to
build the minimal connectivity which robustly implements trajectories that map
a specific input onto a specific output state, and we demonstrate that the
capacity of the obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eigenmodes of a broad class of &quot;sparse&quot; random matrices, with interactions
concentrated near the diagonal, exponentially localize in space, as initially
discovered in 1957 by Anderson for quantum systems. Anderson localization plays
ubiquitous roles in varieties of problems from electrons in solids to
mechanical and optical systems. However, its implications in neuroscience
(where the connections can be strongly asymmetric) have been largely
unexplored, mainly because synaptic connectivity matrices of neural systems are
often &quot;dense&quot;, which makes the eigenmodes spatially extended. Here, we explore
roles that Anderson localization could be playing in neural networks by
focusing on &quot;spatially structured&quot; disorder in synaptic connectivity matrices.
Recently, neuroscientists have experimentally confirmed that the local
excitation and global inhibition (LEGI) ring attractor model can functionally
represent head direction cells in Drosophila melanogaster central brain. We
first study a non-Hermitian (i.e. asymmetric) tight-binding model with disorder
and then establish a connection to the LEGI ring attractor model. We discover
that (i) Principal eigenvectors of the LEGI ring attractor networks with
structured nearest neighbor disorder are &quot;quasi-localized&quot;, even with fully
dense inhibitory connections. (ii) The quasi-localized eigenvectors play
dominant roles in the early time neural dynamics, and the location of the
principal quasi-localized eigenvectors predict an initial location of the &quot;bump
of activity&quot; representing, say, a head direction of an insect. Our
investigations open up a new venue for explorations at the intersection between
the theory of Anderson localization and neural networks with spatially
structured disorder.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping of the Human Hippocampus Shows Much More Frequent Neighbor Sets in Males Than in Females. (arXiv:1811.07423v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the study of the human connectome, the vertices and the edges of the
network of the human brain are analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the
anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly
the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal
fibers, connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory,
it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the
very same, labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the
connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs, novel,
robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the
new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome,
which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices
of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the
neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical
asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes, computed from the Human
Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs, each with 463 nodes. We show
that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets
than women; therefore, in a sense, the connections of the hippocampi are more
regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in
contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus, where it was shown
that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although Darwinian models are rampant in the social sciences, social
scientists do not face the problem that motivated Darwin's theory of natural
selection: the problem of explaining how lineages evolve despite that any
traits they acquire are regularly discarded at the end of the lifetime of the
individuals that acquired them. While the rationale for framing culture as an
evolutionary process is correct, it does not follow that culture is a Darwinian
or selectionist process, or that population genetics and phylogenetics provide
viable starting points for modeling cultural change. This paper lays out
step-by-step arguments as to why this approach is ill-conceived, focusing on
the lack of randomness and lack of a self-assembly code in cultural evolution,
and summarizes an alternative approach.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We examine whether a single biophysical cortical circuit model can explain
both spiking and perceptual variability. We consider perceptual rivalry, which
provides a window into intrinsic neural processing since neural activity in
some brain areas is correlated to the alternating perception rather than the
constant ambiguous stimulus. The prevalent theory for spiking variability is a
chaotic attractor called the balanced state; whereas, the source of perceptual
variability is an open question. We present a dynamical model with a chaotic
attractor that explains both spiking and perceptual variability and adheres to
a broad set of strict experimental constraints. The model makes quantitative
predictions for how both spiking and perceptual variability will change as the
stimulus changes.

The robust computational design of functional proteins has the potential to deeply impact translational research and broaden our understanding of the determinants of protein function and stability. The low success rates of computational design protocols and the extensive in vitro optimization often required, highlight the challenge of designing proteins that perform essential biochemical functions, such as binding or catalysis. One of the most simplistic approaches for the design of function is to adopt functional motifs in naturally occurring proteins and transplant them to computationally designed proteins. The structural complexity of the functional motif largely determines how readily one can find host protein structures that are “designable”, meaning that are likely to present the functional motif in the desired conformation. One promising route to enhance the “designability” of protein structures is to allow backbone flexibility. Here, we present a computational approach that couples conformational folding with sequence design to embed functional motifs into heterologous proteins—Rosetta Functional Folding and Design (FunFolDes). We performed extensive computational benchmarks, where we observed that the enforcement of functional requirements resulted in designs distant from the global energetic minimum of the protein. An observation consistent with several experimental studies that have revealed function-stability tradeoffs. To test the design capabilities of FunFolDes we transplanted two viral epitopes into distant structural templates including one &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; “functionless” fold, which represent two typical challenges where the designability problem arises. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized showing high binding affinities to monoclonal antibodies, making them valuable candidates for vaccine design endeavors. Overall, we present an accessible strategy to repurpose old protein folds for new functions. This may lead to important improvements on the computational design of proteins, with structurally complex functional sites, that can perform elaborate biochemical functions related to binding and catalysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7gRf2xrFcak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances in modeling oxygen supply to cortical brain tissue have begun to elucidate the functional mechanisms of neurovascular coupling. While the principal mechanisms of blood flow regulation after neuronal firing are generally known, mechanistic hemodynamic simulations cannot yet pinpoint the exact spatial and temporal coordination between the network of arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins for the entire brain. Because of the potential significance of blood flow and oxygen supply simulations for illuminating spatiotemporal regulation inside the cortical microanatomy, there is a need to create mathematical models of the entire cerebral circulation with realistic anatomical detail. Our hypothesis is that an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the cerebrocirculatory architecture will inform about possible regulatory mechanisms of the neurovascular interface. In this article, we introduce large-scale networks of the murine cerebral circulation spanning the Circle of Willis, main cerebral arteries connected to the pial network down to the microcirculation in the capillary bed. Several multiscale models were generated from state-of-the-art neuroimaging data. Using a vascular network construction algorithm, the entire circulation of the middle cerebral artery was synthesized. Blood flow simulations indicate a consistent trend of higher hematocrit in deeper cortical layers, while surface layers with shorter vascular path lengths seem to carry comparatively lower red blood cell (RBC) concentrations. Moreover, the variability of RBC flux decreases with cortical depth. These results support the notion that plasma skimming serves a self-regulating function for maintaining uniform oxygen perfusion to neurons irrespective of their location in the blood supply hierarchy. Our computations also demonstrate the practicality of simulating blood flow for large portions of the mouse brain with existing computer resources. The efficient simulation of blood flow throughout the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is a promising milestone towards the final aim of predicting blood flow patterns for the entire brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OY-184gvy8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: 3DMorph automatic analysis of microglial morphology in 3 dimensions from ex vivo and in vivo imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0266-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental conditions, as well as from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data, and images of other branching cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of inherited retinal degenerations are due to photoreceptor cell
death. In many cases ganglion cells are spared making it possible to stimulate
them to restore visual function. Several studies (Bi et al., 2006; Lin et al.,
2008; Sengupta et al., 2016; Caporale et al., 2011; Berry et al., 2017) have
shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells
and make them light sensitive. This is a promising strategy to restore vision
since optical targeting may be more precise than electrical stimulation with a
retinal prothesis. However the spatial resolution of
optogenetically-reactivated retinas has not been measured with fine-grained
stimulation patterns. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons,
it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a
small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond
to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial
resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random
checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that
optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region
of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted
accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated
how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to
letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a
patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by
this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal
blindness. This high spatial resolution is a promising result for future
clinical studies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ancient mind/body problem continues to be one of deepest mysteries of
science and of the human spirit. Despite major advances in many fields, there
is still no plausible link between subjective experience (qualia) and its
realization in the body. This paper outlines some of the elements of a rigorous
science of mind (SoM) - key ideas include scientific realism of mind, agnostic
mysterianism, careful attention to language, and a focus on concrete
(touchstone) questions and results.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agonism of the protease activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuroprotection and vasculoprotection in experimental neuro‐injury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurologic injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded, trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial RHAPSODY used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360 and 540μg/kg 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intraarterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to one of the four doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017 we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (p=0.046), and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1±5.8 mL in placebo to 0.8±2.1 mL in the combined treatment arms (p=0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Different types of ubiquitin chains are assumed to selectively signal respectively modified proteins for different fates. In support of this hypothesis, structural studies have shown that the eight possible ubiquitin dimers adopt different conformations. However, at least in some cases, these structures cannot sufficiently explain the molecular basis of the selective signaling mechanisms. This indicates that the available structures represent only a few distinct conformations within the entire conformational space adopted by a ubiquitin dimer. Here, molecular simulations on different levels of resolution can complement the structural information. We have combined exhaustive coarse grained and atomistic simulations of all eight possible ubiquitin dimers with a suitable dimensionality reduction technique and a new method to characterize protein-protein interfaces and the conformational landscape of protein conjugates. We found that ubiquitin dimers exhibit characteristic linkage type-dependent properties in solution, such as interface stability and the character of contacts between the subunits, which can be directly correlated with experimentally observed linkage-specific properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6aIN2Kla9rU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Essential metabolic reactions are shaping constituents of metabolic networks, enabling viable and distinct phenotypes across diverse life forms. Here we analyse and compare modelling predictions of essential metabolic functions with experimental data and thereby identify core metabolic pathways in prokaryotes. Simulations of 15 manually curated genome-scale metabolic models were integrated with 36 large-scale gene essentiality datasets encompassing a wide variety of species of bacteria and archaea. Conservation of metabolic genes was estimated by analysing 79 representative genomes from all the branches of the prokaryotic tree of life. We find that essentiality patterns reflect phylogenetic relations both for modelling and experimental data, which correlate highly at the pathway level. Genes that are essential for several species tend to be highly conserved as opposed to non-essential genes which may be conserved or not. The tRNA-charging module is highlighted as ancestral and with high centrality in the networks, followed closely by cofactor metabolism, pointing to an early information processing system supplied by organic cofactors. The results, which point to model improvements and also indicate faults in the experimental data, should be relevant to the study of centrality in metabolic networks and ancient metabolism but also to metabolic engineering with prokaryotes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YfypktDVdWM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Embryonic neocortical microglia express Toll-like receptor 9 and respond to plasmid DNA injected into the ventricle: technical considerations regarding microglial distribution in electroporated brain walls</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, restored the normal (dispersed) intramural localization of microglia and decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglia have been recently shown to play multiple roles in the embryonic brain. In the trials for labeling neural-lineage cells using IUE technique in CX3CR1-GFP mice, in which microglia express GFP, to achieve dual live-imaging of these cell types, we unexpectedly found that intra-ventricular administration of plasmid DNA caused microglial aberrant accumulation along the luminal surface of the cerebral wall and in the choroid plexus. Notably, Co-administration of TLR9 antagonist into the ventricle together with plasmid DNA restored the normal dispersed localization of microglia in the mid-embryonic (E14) cortex, suggesting that massive microglial accumulation induced by plasmid DNA is primarily mediated by TLR9 activation. Our findings have implications for the application of IUE to investigate embryonic microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the &lt;i&gt;Survival Motor Neuron&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;) mutants lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking SMN. We find that reducing DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in DAF-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; SMA is a pediatric motor neuron disease resulting from the loss of the SMN protein. While great effort has been expended on interventions aimed at increasing levels of compensatory SMN1, identification of genes that modify the SMA phenotype has lagged. Here we undertook a targeted genetic screen to identify SMA disease suppressors. We demonstrated that reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling is beneficial for not only longevity but also locomotor activity in SMA worm models. Our results from anatomical, functional, and genetic studies show that the impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;smn-1&lt;/i&gt; null worms. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone can correct the locomotor dysfunction. This work leads to new understanding of disease pathogenesis and opens up new opportunities for therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The mixed-lineage kinase inhibitor URMC-099 protects hippocampal synapses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against LRRK2 and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS, and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive neurologic decline that correlates with damage to gray matter in the brain, and is not stopped by current treatments. We used a mouse model of MS, in which gray matter injury is associated with inflammatory molecules produced by activated microglia, to test novel neuroprotective treatments. URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties, prevented loss of hippocampal synapses and reversed deficits in learning and memory in a mouse model of MS. An MLK inhibitor with a narrower range of specificity was not effective, suggesting that combination kinase inhibition with URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin-A increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23 h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 d) and not recent (tested at 24 h) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 d after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1 h, but protected the memory from further decline 24 h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed postlearning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: p11 in Cholinergic Interneurons of the Nucleus Accumbens Is Essential for Dopamine Responses to Rewarding Stimuli</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0332-18.2018?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0332-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food, and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type (WT) mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 knock-out (KO) mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: In Vivo Volume Dynamics of Dendritic Spines in the Neocortex of Wild-Type and Fmr1 KO Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0282-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover rates of neocortical spines &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a greater extent in a mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout) of fragile X mental retardation than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. Such features of spine dynamics in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice could be represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent differences in the statistical distribution in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice even in adulthood, which reflects the abnormal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dynamics of spine volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes are fully determined by cortical contractions</title>

Cytoplasmic flows are an ubiquitous feature of biological systems, in particular in large cells, such as oocytes and eggs in early animal development. Here we show that cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes, which can be imaged well with transmission light microscopy, are fully determined by the cortical dynamics during surface contraction waves. We first show that the dynamics of the oocyte surface is highly symmetric around the animal-vegetal axis. We then mathematically solve the Stokes equation for flows inside a deforming sphere using the measured surface displacements as boundary conditions. Our theoretical predictions agree very well with the intracellular flows quantified by particle image velocimetry, proving that during this stage the starfish cytoplasm behaves as a simple Newtonian fluid on the micrometer scale. We calculate the pressure field inside the oocyte and find that its gradient is too small as to explain polar body extrusion, in contrast to earlier suggestions. Myosin II inhibition by blebbistatin confirms this conclusion, because it diminishes cell shape changes and hydrodynamic flow, but does not abolish polar body formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TABMnyJYzl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Patterning the insect eye: From stochastic to deterministic mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006363</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/WfAj38t5J5A/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Haleh Ebadi, Michael Perry, Keith Short, Konstantin Klemm, Claude Desplan, Peter F. Stadler, Anita Mehta&lt;/p&gt;

While most processes in biology are highly deterministic, stochastic mechanisms are sometimes used to increase cellular diversity. In human and Drosophila eyes, photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light are distributed in stochastic patterns, and one such patterning system has been analyzed in detail in the Drosophila retina. Interestingly, some species in the dipteran family Dolichopodidae (the “long legged” flies, or “Doli”) instead exhibit highly orderly deterministic eye patterns. In these species, alternating columns of ommatidia (unit eyes) produce corneal lenses of different colors. Occasional perturbations in some individuals disrupt the regular columns in a way that suggests that patterning occurs via a posterior-to-anterior signaling relay during development, and that specification follows a local, cellular-automaton-like rule. We hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms that pattern the eye are largely conserved among flies and that the difference between unordered Drosophila and ordered dolichopodid eyes can be explained in terms of relative strengths of signaling interactions rather than a rewiring of the regulatory network itself. We present a simple stochastic model that is capable of explaining both the stochastic Drosophila eye and the striped pattern of Dolichopodidae eyes and thereby characterize the least number of underlying developmental rules necessary to produce both stochastic and deterministic patterns. We show that only small changes to model parameters are needed to also reproduce intermediate, semi-random patterns observed in another Doli species, and quantification of ommatidial distributions in these eyes suggests that their patterning follows similar rules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfAj38t5J5A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Ponce-Alvarez et al. show that zebrafish larvae generate spontaneous neuronal avalanches across the entire brain. These collective cascading events exhibit scale invariance, typical of critical phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, paper crumpling). The brain’s critical dynamics are modulated during interactions with the environment.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Theta Bursts Precede, and Spindles Follow, Cortical and Thalamic Downstates in Human NREM Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9989?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9989?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10–12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12–16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5–8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at ~12 times a second lasting for ~a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at ~six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ipsilesional Motor Cortex Plasticity Participates in Spontaneous Hindlimb Recovery after Lateral Hemisection of the Thoracic Spinal Cord in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9977?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9977?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) spontaneous motor recovery can occur in mammals, but the underlying neural substrates remain poorly understood. The motor cortex is crucial for skilled motor learning and the voluntary control of movement and is known to reorganize after cortical injury to promote recovery. Motor cortex plasticity has also been shown to parallel the recovery of forelimb function after cervical SCI, but whether cortical plasticity participates in hindlimb recovery after SCI remains unresolved. Using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping, behavioral and cortical inactivation techniques in the female Long–Evans rat, we evaluated the spontaneous cortical mechanisms of hindlimb motor recovery 1–5 weeks after lateral hemisection of the thoracic (T8) spinal cord that ablated the crossed corticospinal tract (CST) from the contralesional motor cortex while sparing the majority of the CST from the ipsilesional motor cortex. Hemisection initially impaired hindlimb motor function bilaterally but significant recovery occurred during the first 3 weeks. ICMS revealed time-dependent changes in motor cortex organization, characterized by a chronic abolishment of hindlimb motor representation in the contralesional motor cortex and the development of transient bilateral hindlimb representation in the ipsilesional motor cortex 3 weeks after hemisection, when significant behavioral recovery occurred. Consistently, reversible inactivation of the ipsilesional, but not the contralesional motor cortex, during skilled ladder walking 3 weeks after hemisection reinstated deficits in both hindlimbs. These findings indicate that the ipsilesional motor cortex transiently reorganizes after lateral hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord to support recovery of hindlimb motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Partial motor recovery can occur after an incomplete spinal cord injury and is hypothesized to result from the reorganization of spared descending motor pathways. The motor cortex is crucial for the control of voluntary movement and contains topographical movement representations (motor maps) that are highly plastic. We examined the organization of hindlimb motor maps bilaterally after a lateral hemisection of the spinal cord to show that while motor maps are abolished in the deefferented cortex, the spared ipsilesional cortex transiently reorganizes to gain a representation of the affected hindlimb after injury that relates to recovery. This finding demonstrates that plasticity in the ipsilesional motor cortex at early time points after spinal cord hemisection is initially important to support motor recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with delayed excitatory feedback and without feedback. (arXiv:1811.05403v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05403</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05403</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A class of spiking neuronal models with threshold 2 is considered. It is
defined by a set of conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as
the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) or the binding neuron model and also for
some artificial neurons. A neuron is stimulated with a Poisson stream of
excitatory impulses. Each output impulse is conveyed through the feedback line
to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (pdf) $p(t)$ of
output interspike intervals (ISI) values for a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback, intensity of the input
stream $\lambda$ and the properties of the feedback line. Also, we derive the
exact relation for calculating the moments of $p(t)$ based on known moments of
$p^0(t)$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obtained general expression for $p(t)$ is checked numerically using Monte
Carlo simulation for the case of LIF model. The course of $p(t)$ has a
$\delta$-function type peculiarity. This fact contributes to the discussion
about the possibility to model neuronal activity with Poisson process,
supporting the 'no' answer.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Silent Synapse Unsilencing in Hippocampal CA1 Neurons for Associative Fear Memory Storage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy288</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Clarifying learning-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal circuits is critical for understanding hippocampal mechanisms of memory acquisition and storage. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated learning-associated plasticity at hippocampal synapses. However, as a neural basis of memory encoding, the nature of synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal neuronal responses to memorized stimulation remains elusive. Using in vivo whole-cell recording in anaesthetized adult rats and mice, we investigated synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in response to a flash of visual stimulation as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in associative fear conditioning. We found that shortly (&amp;lt;3 days) after conditioning, excitatory synaptic responses and spiking responses to the flash CS emerged in a large number (~70%) of CA1 PCs, a neuronal population previously unresponsive to the flash before conditioning. The learning-induced CA1 excitatory responsiveness was further indicated to result from postsynaptic unsilencing at flash-associated silent synapses, with NMDA receptor-gated responses we recently reported in naive animals. Our findings suggest that associative fear learning can induce excitatory responsiveness to the memorized CS in a large population of CA1 neurons, via a process of postsynaptic unsilencing at CA1 silent synapses, which may be critical for hippocampal acquisition and storage of associative memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Person-Based Brain Morphometric Similarity is Heritable and Correlates With Biological Features</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy287</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy287/5181558?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person’s brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Voluntary Wheel Running Exercise Evoked by Food-Restriction Stress Exacerbates Weight Loss of Adolescent Female Rats But Also Promotes Resilience by Enhancing GABAergic Inhibition of Pyramidal Neurons in the Dorsal Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy283</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy283/5181559?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Adolescence is marked by increased vulnerability to mental disorders and maladaptive behaviors, including anorexia nervosa. Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second–fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons’ GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual’s suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles—exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Concurrence of Cortical Surface Area Expansion and White Matter Myelination in Human Brain Development</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human brain undergoes dramatic structural changes during childhood that co-occur with behavioral development. These age-related changes are documented for the brain’s gray matter and white matter. However, their interrelation is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated age-related effects in cortical thickness (CT) and in cortical surface area (SA) as parts of the gray matter volume as well as age effects in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation times in the white matter. Data from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 170 children between the ages of 3 and 7 years contributed to the sample. We found a high spatial overlap of age-related correlations between SA and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation times of the corresponding white matter connections, but no such relation between SA and CT. These results indicate that during childhood the developmental expansion of the cortical surface goes hand-in-hand with age-related increase of white matter fiber connections terminating in the cortical surface.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Moth olfactory receptor neurons adjust their encoding efficiency to temporal statistics of pheromone fluctuations</title>

The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that sensory neurons adjust their coding resources to optimally represent the stimulus statistics of their environment. To test this prediction in the moth olfactory system, we have developed a stimulation protocol that mimics the natural temporal structure within a turbulent pheromone plume. We report that responses of antennal olfactory receptor neurons to pheromone encounters follow the temporal fluctuations in such a way that the most frequent stimulus timescales are encoded with maximum accuracy. We also observe that the average coding precision of the neurons adjusted to the stimulus-timescale statistics at a given distance from the pheromone source is higher than if the same encoding model is applied at a shorter, non-matching, distance. Finally, the coding accuracy profile and the stimulus-timescale distribution are related in the manner predicted by the information theory for the many-to-one convergence scenario of the moth peripheral sensory system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3ETnhHC120&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparing Bayesian and non-Bayesian accounts of human confidence reports</title>

Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite of Bayesian inference. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in a non-Bayesian way. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1ezyXe_qUo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package &lt;i&gt;PhyDyn&lt;/i&gt; for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwoD24QGeY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences using mutual information</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne-Florence Bitbol&lt;/p&gt;

Functional protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sTP41XDQ1ZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A regularity index for dendrites - local statistics of a neuron's input space</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Anton-Sanchez, Felix Effenberger, Concha Bielza, Pedro Larrañaga, Hermann Cuntz&lt;/p&gt;

Neurons collect their inputs from other neurons by sending out arborized dendritic structures. However, the relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs in the neural tissue remains unclear. Inputs could be distributed in tight clusters, entirely randomly or else in a regular grid-like manner. Here, we analyze dendritic branching structures using a regularity index &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, based on average nearest neighbor distances between branch and termination points, characterizing their spatial distribution. We find that the distributions of these points depend strongly on cell types, indicating possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; is independent of cell size and we find that it is only weakly correlated with other branching statistics, suggesting that it might reflect features of dendritic morphology that are not captured by commonly studied branching statistics. We then use morphological models based on optimal wiring principles to study the relation between input distributions and dendritic branching structures. Using our models, we find that branch point distributions correlate more closely with the input distributions while termination points in dendrites are generally spread out more randomly with a close to uniform distribution. We validate these model predictions with connectome data. Finally, we find that in spatial input distributions with increasing regularity, characteristic scaling relationships between branching features are altered significantly. In summary, we conclude that local statistics of input distributions and dendrite morphology depend on each other leading to potentially cell type specific branching features.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ori6Lo6m244&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Functional mechanisms underlie the emergence of a diverse range of plasticity phenomena</title>

Diverse plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying brain functions. However, why these plasticity rules emerge and how their dynamics interact with neural activity to give rise to complex neural circuit dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we show that both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity rules emerge from a functional perspective of neuronal dynamics whereby each neuron learns to encode its own activity in the population activity, so that the activity of the presynaptic neuron can be decoded from the activity of its postsynaptic neurons. We explain how a range of experimentally observed plasticity phenomena with widely separated time scales emerge from learning this encoding function, including STDP and its frequency dependence, and metaplasticity. We show that when implemented in neural circuits, these plasticity rules naturally give rise to essential neural response properties, including variable neural dynamics with balanced excitation and inhibition, and approximately log-normal distributions of synaptic strengths, while simultaneously encoding a complex real-world visual stimulus. These findings establish a novel function-based account of diverse plasticity mechanisms, providing a unifying framework relating plasticity, dynamics and neural computation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4hnBgLInEwc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Population structure can strongly affect evolutionary dynamics. The most general way to describe population structures are graphs. An important observable on evolutionary graphs is the probability that a novel mutation spreads through the entire population. But what drives this spread of a mutation towards fixation? Here, we propose a novel way to understand the forces driving fixation by borrowing techniques from evolutionary demography to quantify the invasion fitness and the effective population size for different graphs. Our method is very general and even applies to weighted graphs with node dependent fitness. However, we focus on analytical results for undirected graphs with node independent fitness. The method will allow to conceptually integrate evolutionary graph theory with theoretical genetics of structured populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uezjpMD9TOY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sensitive Period for Cognitive Repurposing of Human Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Connectivity Changes of Key Regions for Motor Initiation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Akinesia, a cardinal symptom of Parkinson’s disease, has been linked to abnormal activation in putamen and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). However, little is known whether clinical severity of akinesia is linked to dysfunctional connectivity of these regions. Using a seed-based approach, we here investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of putamen, pMFC and primary motor cortex (M1) in 60 patients with Parkinson’s disease on regular medication and 72 healthy controls. We found that in patients putamen featured decreases of connectivity for a number of cortical and subcortical areas engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In contrast, the pMFC showed reduced connectivity with a more focal cortical network involved in higher-level motor-cognition. Finally, M1 featured a selective disruption of connectivity in a network specifically connected with M1. Correlating clinical impairment with connectivity changes revealed a relationship between akinesia and reduced RSFC between pMFC and left intraparietal lobule (IPL). Together, the present study demonstrated RSFC decreases in networks for motor initiation and execution in Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, results suggest a relationship between pMFC-IPL decoupling and the manifestation of akinetic symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The first voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed in 282 patients with major depressive disorder compared with 254 controls, some higher, and some lower FCs. However, in 125 unmedicated patients, primarily increases of FC were found: of the subcallosal anterior cingulate with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, of the pregenual/supracallosal anterior cingulate with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and of parts of the anterior cingulate with the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and with early cortical visual areas. In the 157 medicated patients, these and other FCs were lower than in the unmedicated group. Parcellation was performed based on the FC of individual ACC voxels in healthy controls. A pregenual subdivision had high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and a supracallosal subdivision had high FC with lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The high FC in depression between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal parts of the ACC provides a mechanism for more non-reward information transmission to the ACC, contributing to depression.

	<title>Neuron: Merkel Cells Activate Sensory Neural Pathways through Adrenergic Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30942-5?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30942-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Hoffman et al. reveal the molecular machinery underlying neurotransmission at a gentle-touch receptor. Employing Eccles’s classical criteria for a chemical synapse, they show that epithelial Merkel cells communicate with sensory neurons through β2-adrenergic receptors at excitatory synapses.</description>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30939-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Litvinchuk et al. show that complement C3aR plays a critical role in mediating immune homeostasis and tau pathology. The identification of a conserved C3aR network and crosstalk between complement signaling with STAT3 activation reveal novel pathogenic and therapeutic insights.</description>
