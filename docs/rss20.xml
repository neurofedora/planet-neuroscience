	<description>How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</description>

	<description>In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</description>

	<description>The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: State equation from the spectral structure of human brain activity. (arXiv:1806.07365v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural electromagnetic (EM) signals recorded non-invasively from individual
human subjects vary in complexity and magnitude. Nonetheless, variation in
neural activity has been difficult to quantify and interpret, due to complex,
broad-band features in the frequency domain. Studying signals recorded with
magnetoencephalography (MEG) from healthy young adult subjects while in resting
and active states, a systematic framework inspired by thermodynamics is applied
to neural EM signals. Despite considerable inter-subject variation in terms of
spectral entropy and energy across time epochs, data support the existence of a
robust and linear relationship defining an effective state equation, with
higher energy and lower entropy in the resting state compared to active,
consistently across subjects. Mechanisms underlying the emergence of
relationships between empirically measured effective state functions are
further investigated using a model network of coupled oscillators, suggesting
an interplay between noise and coupling strength can account for coherent
variation of empirically observed quantities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the big restrictions in brain computer interface field is the very
limited training samples, it is difficult to build a reliable and usable system
with such limited data. Inspired by generative adversarial networks, we propose
a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial (cDCGAN) Networks
method to generate more artificial EEG signal automatically for data
augmentation to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks in
brain computer interface field and overcome the small training dataset
problems. We evaluate the proposed cDCGAN method on BCI competition dataset of
motor imagery. The results show that the generated artificial EEG data from
Gaussian noise can learn the features from raw EEG data and has no less than
the classification accuracy of raw EEG data in the testing dataset. Also by
using generated artificial data can effectively improve classification accuracy
at the same model with limited training data.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Target localization across saccades and at fixation: Nontargets both facilitate and bias responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/351833v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/351833v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The image on our retina changes every time we make an eye movement. To maintain visual stability across saccades, specifically to locate visual targets, we may use nontarget objects as &quot;landmarks&quot;. In the current study, we compared how the presence of nontargets affects target localization across saccades and during sustained fixation. Participants fixated a target object, which either maintained its location on the screen (sustained-fixation trials), or displaced to trigger a saccade (saccade trials). After the target disappeared, participants reported the most recent target location with a mouse click. We found that the presence of nontargets decreased response error magnitude and variability. However, this nontarget facilitation effect was not larger for saccade trials than sustained-fixation trials, indicating that nontarget facilitation might be a general effect for target localization, rather than of particular importance to saccadic stability. Additionally, participants' responses were biased towards the nontarget locations, particularly when the nontarget-target relationships were preserved in relative coordinates across the saccade. This nontarget bias interacted with biases from other spatial references, e.g. eye movement paths, possibly in a way that emphasized non-redundant information. In summary, the presence of nontargets is one of several sources of reference that combine to influence (both facilitate and bias) target localization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Mechanism for Synaptic Copy between Neural Circuits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/351114v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/351114v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The brain has a central, short-term learning module, the hippocampus, which transfers what it has learned to long-term memory in cortex during non-REM sleep. The putative mechanism responsible for this type of memory consolidation invokes hierarchically nested hippocampal ripples (100-250 Hz), thalamo-cortical spindles (7-15 Hz), and cortical slow oscillations (&amp;lt; 1 Hz) to enable transfer. Suppression of, for instance, thalamic spindles has been shown to impair hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation. Cortical oscillations are central to information transfer in neural systems. Significant evidence supports the idea that coincident spike input can allow the neural threshold to be overcome, and spikes to be propagated downstream in a circuit. Thus, an observation of oscillations in neural circuits would be an indication that repeated synchronous spiking is enabling information transfer. However, for memory transfer, in which synaptic weights must be being transferred from one neural circuit (region) to another, what is the mechanism? Here, we present a synaptic transfer mechanism whose structure provides some understanding of the phenomena that have been implicated in memory transfer, including the nested oscillations at various frequencies. The circuit is based on the principle of pulse-gated, graded information transfer between neural populations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Complexin cooperates with Bruchpilot to tether synaptic vesicles to the active zone cytomatrix</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350207v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350207v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Information processing by the nervous system depends on the release of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the presynaptic active zone. Molecular components of the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) regulate the final stages of the SV cycle preceding exocytosis and thereby shape the efficacy and plasticity of synaptic transmission. Part of this regulation is reflected by a physical association of SVs with filamentous CAZ structures. However, our understanding of the protein interactions underlying SV tethering by the CAZ is far from complete. The very C-terminal region of Bruchpilot (Brp), a key component of the Drosophila CAZ, participates in SV tethering. Yet so far, no vesicular or cytoplasmic molecules have been reported to engage in an interaction with Brp's C-terminus. Here, we carried out an in vivo screen for molecules that link the Brp C-terminus to SVs. This strategy identified the conserved SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor) regulator Complexin (Cpx) as a vesicular interaction partner of Brp. We show that Brp and Cpx interact genetically and functionally. Interfering with Cpx targeting to SVs mirrored distinctive features of a C-terminal Brp truncation: impaired SV recruitment to the CAZ and enhanced short-term synaptic depression. Extending the study beyond Drosophila synapses, we interrogated active zones of mouse rod bipolar cells. Here, too, we collected evidence for an evolutionarily conserved role of Cpx upstream of SNARE complex assembly where it participates in SV tethering to the CAZ.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems modelling of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network predicts and prioritizes synergistic drug combinations for triple-negative breast cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006192</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Young Shin, Anna-Katharina Müller, Nandini Verma, Sima Lev, Lan K. Nguyen&lt;/p&gt;

Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lYpC_ByFRf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behavior in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of dSTIM, Ral, or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral-mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mushroom body (MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory, although exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here, we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in the boutons and conditioned behavioral responses to learned odors in honeybees. We found that the absolute amount of the neural change for the rewarded but not for the unrewarded odor was correlated with the behavioral learning rate across individuals. The temporal profile of the induced changes matched with odor response dynamics of the MB-associated inhibitory neurons, suggestive of activity modulation of boutons by this neural class. We hypothesize the circuit-specific neural plasticity relates to the learned value of the stimulus and underlies the conditioned behavior of the bees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Motor variability from exploration is crucial for reinforcement learning as it allows the nervous system to find new task solutions. However, motor variability from noise can be detrimental to learning and may underlie slowed reinforcement learning performance observed in individuals with cerebellar damage. Here we examine whether artificially increasing noise in healthy individuals slows reinforcement learning in a similar manner to that seen in cerebellar patients. Participants used binary reinforcement to learn to rotate their reach angle in a series of directions. By comparing task performance between conditions with different levels of added noise, we show that adding a high level of noise – matched to a group of cerebellar patients – slows learning. In additional experiments we show that the detrimental effect of noise may lie in reinforcing incorrect behavior, rather than not reinforcing correct behavior. By comparing performance between healthy participants with added noise and a group of cerebellar patients, we found that added noise does not slow the control group’s learning to the same degree observed in the patient group. Using a mechanistic model, we show that added noise in the present study matched patients’ motor noise and total learning. However, increased exploration in the control group relative to the cerebellar group supports faster learning. Our results suggest that motor noise slows reinforcement learning by impairing the mapping of reward to the correct action and this may underlie deficits induced by cerebellar damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the contribution of reinforcement mechanisms to human motor learning has been the subject of renewed interest. Exploration (i.e. varying one’s movement) is crucial to reinforcement learning. Yet, motor variability can arise from multiple sources and the manner in which these influence learning remains poorly understood. Here, we show that artificially increasing motor noise variability slows reinforcement learning in a similar manner to that observed in people with cerebellar damage. Importantly, we show that the detrimental effect of noise may be the attribution of reinforcement to incorrect behavior, rather than not reinforcing correct behavior. These findings indicate that variability from noise may not be accessible to reinforcement learning mechanisms, which sheds light on the mechanism of deficit following cerebellar damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin&lt;br /&gt; Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The mechanisms that drive this functional diversification are of great interest because they enable adaptive behaviors and are targets of pathology. Considerable effort has focused on elucidating mechanisms of plasticity that involve changes to presynaptic release probability and the number of postsynaptic receptors. However, recent work is clarifying that nanoscale organization of the proteins within glutamatergic synapses impacts synapse function. Specifically, active zone scaffold proteins form nanoclusters that define sites of neurotransmitter release, and these sites align transsynaptically with clustered postsynaptic receptors. These nanostructural characteristics raise numerous possibilities for how synaptic plasticity could be expressed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne&lt;br /&gt; Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Erzurumlu&lt;br /&gt; Molecular identification of neuronal types and genetic and imaging approaches to characterize their properties reveal morphological, physiological and dynamic aspects of sensory circuit development. Here we focus on the mouse tactile sensory circuitry, with particular emphasis on the main trigeminal pathway that connects the whiskers, the major tactile organ in rodents, to the neocortex. At each level of this pathway, neurogenesis, axonal elongation, pathfinding, target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner&lt;br /&gt; Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, classical and recent anatomical and physiological studies are reviewed to show that, in mammals, the striatum can detect discrete task-relevant sensory stimuli and continuously track somatosensory information associated with the generation of simple movements and more complex actions. Rather than contributing to the immediate selection of actions, the striatum may monitor the sensorimotor state of animals by integrating somatosensory information and motor-related signals on a moment-by-moment basis. Such function could be critical for the progressive acquisition or updating of adaptive actions and the emergence of an embodied sense of time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast and Accurate Multiclass Inference for MI-BCIs Using Large Multiscale Temporal and Spectral Features. (arXiv:1806.06823v1 [eess.SP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate, fast, and reliable multiclass classification of
electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a challenging task towards the
development of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) systems. We
propose enhancements to different feature extractors, along with a support
vector machine (SVM) classifier, to simultaneously improve classification
accuracy and execution time during training and testing. We focus on the
well-known common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian covariance methods, and
significantly extend these two feature extractors to multiscale temporal and
spectral cases. The multiscale CSP features achieve 73.70$\pm$15.90% (mean$\pm$
standard deviation across 9 subjects) classification accuracy that surpasses
the state-of-the-art method [1], 70.6$\pm$14.70%, on the 4-class BCI
competition IV-2a dataset. The Riemannian covariance features outperform the
CSP by achieving 74.27$\pm$15.5% accuracy and executing 9x faster in training
and 4x faster in testing. Using more temporal windows for Riemannian features
results in 75.47$\pm$12.8% accuracy with 1.6x faster testing than CSP.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Drifting perceptual patterns suggest prediction errors fusion rather than hypothesis selection: replicating the rubber-hand illusion on a robot. (arXiv:1806.06809v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans can experience fake body parts as theirs just by simple visuo-tactile
synchronous stimulation. This body-illusion is accompanied by a drift in the
perception of the real limb towards the fake limb, suggesting an update of body
estimation resulting from stimulation. This work compares body limb drifting
patterns of human participants, in a rubber hand illusion experiment, with the
end-effector estimation displacement of a multisensory robotic arm enabled with
predictive processing perception. Results show similar drifting patterns in
both human and robot experiments, and they also suggest that the perceptual
drift is due to prediction error fusion, rather than hypothesis selection. We
present body inference through prediction error minimization as one single
process that unites predictive coding and causal inference and that it is
responsible for the effects in perception when we are subjected to intermodal
sensory perturbations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modularity Matters: Learning Invariant Relational Reasoning Tasks. (arXiv:1806.06765v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06765</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06765</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We focus on two supervised visual reasoning tasks whose labels encode a
semantic relational rule between two or more objects in an image: the MNIST
Parity task and the colorized Pentomino task. The objects in the images undergo
random translation, scaling, rotation and coloring transformations. Thus these
tasks involve invariant relational reasoning. We report uneven performance of
various deep CNN models on these two tasks. For the MNIST Parity task, we
report that the VGG19 model soundly outperforms a family of ResNet models.
Moreover, the family of ResNet models exhibits a general sensitivity to random
initialization for the MNIST Parity task. For the colorized Pentomino task, now
both the VGG19 and ResNet models exhibit sluggish optimization and very poor
test generalization, hovering around 30% test error. The CNN we tested all
learn hierarchies of fully distributed features and thus encode the distributed
representation prior. We are motivated by a hypothesis from cognitive
neuroscience which posits that the human visual cortex is modularized, and this
allows the visual cortex to learn higher order invariances. To this end, we
consider a modularized variant of the ResNet model, referred to as a Residual
Mixture Network (ResMixNet) which employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to
interleave distributed representations with more specialized, modular
representations. We show that very shallow ResMixNets are capable of learning
each of the two tasks well, attaining less than 2% and 1% test error on the
MNIST Parity and the colorized Pentomino tasks respectively. Most importantly,
the ResMixNet models are extremely parameter efficient: generalizing better
than various non-modular CNNs that have over 10x the number of parameters.
These experimental results support the hypothesis that modularity is a robust
prior for learning invariant relational reasoning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex is known to be involved in many high-level cognitive
functions, in particular, working memory. Here, we study to what extent a group
of randomly connected units (namely an Echo State Network, ESN) can store and
maintain (as output) an arbitrary real value from a streamed input, i.e. can
act as a sustained working memory unit. Furthermore, we explore to what extent
such an architecture can take advantage of the stored value in order to produce
non-linear computations. Comparison between different architectures (with and
without feedback, with and without a working memory unit) shows that an
explicit memory improves the performances.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06412</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity in the brain generates synchronous oscillations of the
Local Field Potential (LFP). The traditional analyses of the LFPs are based on
decomposing the signal into simpler components, such as sinusoidal harmonics.
However, a common drawback of such methods is that the decomposition primitives
are usually presumed from the onset, which may bias our understanding of the
signal's structure. Here, we introduce an alternative approach that allows an
impartial, high resolution, hands-off decomposition of the brain waves into a
small number of discrete, frequency-modulated oscillatory processes, which we
call oscillons. In particular, we demonstrate that mouse hippocampal LFP
contain a single oscillon that occupies the $\theta$-frequency band and a
couple of $\gamma$-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast
$\gamma$-waves. Since the oscillons were identified empirically, they may
represent the actual, physical structure of synchronous oscillations in
neuronal ensembles, whereas Fourier-defined &quot;brain waves&quot; are nothing but
poorly resolved oscillons.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human primary motor cortex represents evidence for a perceptual decision before motor response</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350876v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350876v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Perceptual decision making involves a complex network of brain regions including premotor and motor cortices. Premotor areas activate in proportion to the available evidence, thus anticipating the movements required to indicate the still developing decision. Conversely, primary motor cortex is thought to execute planned movements indicating a completed decision by innervating muscles. Recent results question this strict division of labour among premotor and primary motor areas, but the exact role of primary motor areas in perceptual decision making remains unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that human primary motor cortex follows the ups and downs of available evidence during decision making. We used stimuli changing randomly every 100 ms to induce fast variations in the available decision evidence throughout single trials. The stimuli were chosen such that participants had to observe typically more than 5 stimulus changes before being able to make a confident decision. This enabled us to investigate corresponding changes in brain signals within trials. We correlated the stimulus-induced varying evidence as predicted by an ideal observer model with the ongoing neuronal signals measured by magnetoencephalography. This approach provided us with unprecedented statistical precision for identifying brain areas that represent decision evidence. We found that the primary motor cortex of humans indeed represents decision evidence, at least 500 milliseconds before the actual response, confirming that it is not just executing, but also anticipating decisions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Coherent chaos in a recurrent neural network with structured connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350801v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350801v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We present a simple model for coherent, spatially correlated chaos in a recurrent neural network. Networks of randomly connected neurons are known to exhibit chaotic fluctuations and have been studied as a model for the temporal variability of neocortical activity. The dynamics generated by such networks, however, are spatially uncorrelated and do not generate coherent fluctuations, which are commonly observed across spatial scales of the neocortex. In our model we introduce a structured component of connectivity, in addition to random connections, which effectively embeds a feedforward structure via unidirectional coupling between a pair of orthogonal modes. Local fluctuations driven by the random connectivity are summed by an output mode and drive coherent activity along an input mode. The orthogonality between input and output mode preserves chaotic fluctuations even as coherence develops. In the regime of weak structured connectivity we apply a perturbative approach to solve the dynamic mean-field equations, showing that in this regime coherent fluctuations are driven passively by the chaos of local residual fluctuations. Strikingly, the chaotic dynamics are not subdued by even very strong structured connectivity as long as we add a detailed balance constraint on the random connectivity. In this regime the system displays longer time-scales and switching-like activity reminiscent of &quot;Up-Down&quot; states observed in cortical circuits. The level of coherence grows with increasing strength of structured connectivity until the dynamics are almost entirely constrained to a single spatial mode. We describe how in this regime the network achieves intermittent self-organized criticality in which the coherent component of the dynamics self-adjusts to yield periods of slow chaos. Furthermore, we show how the dynamics depend qualitatively on the particular realization of the connectivity matrix: a complex leading eigenvector can yield coherent oscillatory chaotic fluctuations while a real leading eigenvector can yield chaos with broken symmetry. We examine the effects of network-size scaling and show that these results are not finite-size effects. Finally, we show that in the regime of weak structured connectivity, coherent chaos emerges also for a generalized structured connectivity with multiple input-output modes.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350736v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Using an arsenal of conceptual, computational and statistical tools previously developed for the study of origin-related exploration in animals, we compared exploration of human pre-walking Typically-Developing (TD) and Non-Typically Developing (NTD) infants in the presence of mother. We found that while the TD infants exhibited a highly mother-centered organization involving excursions from mother and back to her, and deep engagement with mother when visiting her, the NTD infants tended to avoid mother's place, performing few, if any excursions, and exhibiting shallow engagement with mother. Given the pervasiveness of origin-related exploration in invertebrates, vertebrates, and primates, it would now be a challenge to find an animal model that would exhibit active exploration while ignoring or suppressing the return to the origin, be it a mother or any other safe haven.</description>

	<description>Ongoing, spontaneous pain is characteristic of inflammatory joint pain and reduces an individual's quality of life. To understand the neural basis of inflammatory joint pain, we made a unilateral knee injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in mice, which reduced their natural digging behavior. We hypothesized that sensitization of knee-innervating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons underlies this altered behavior. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophysiological recordings on retrograde labelled knee-innervating DRG neurons and measured responses to a number of electrical and chemical stimuli. We found that 24-hours after CFA-induced knee inflammation, knee neurons show a decreased action potential generation threshold, as well as increased GABA and capsaicin sensitivity, but have unaltered acid sensitivity. The inflammation-induced sensitization of knee neurons persisted for 24-hours in culture, but was not observed after 48-hours in culture. Through immunohistochemistry, we showed that the increased knee neuron capsaicin sensitivity correlated with enhanced expression of the capsaicin receptor, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in the CFA-injected side. We also observed an increase in the co-expression of TRPV1 with tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), which is the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that NGF partially induces the increased TRPV1 expression. Lastly, we found that systemic administration of the TRPV1 antagonist A-425619 reversed the decrease in digging behavior induced by CFA injection, further confirming the role of TRPV1, expressed by knee neurons, in acute inflammatory joint pain.</description>

	<description>Optimal integration and segregation of neuronal connections are necessary for efficient large-scale network communication between distributed cortical regions while allowing for modular specialization. This network dynamic is enabled at the cortical mesoscale by the organization of nodes into communities. Previous in vivo efforts to map the mesoscale architecture in humans had several limitations. Here we characterize a consensus multiresolution mesoscale organization of the functional cortical network. We derive this consensus from the clustering of subject-level networks. We show that this subject-derived consensus framework yields clusters that better map to the individual, compared to the widely-used group-derived consensus approach. We also show that using clustering methods tailored for correlation networks results in functional communities that better fit anatomical metadata. We applied this analysis to state of the art magnetic resonance imaging data from 1003 healthy individuals part of the Human Connectome Project. The hierarchical atlas will be made publicly available for future investigators.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ultra-Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Reveals Dynamics of Feedforward and Feedback Processes in the Ventral Visual Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350421v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Human visual recognition activates a dense network of overlapping feedforward and recurrent neuronal processes, making it hard to disentangle processing in the feedforward from the feedback direction. Here, we used ultra-rapid serial visual presentation to suppress sustained activity that blurs the boundaries of processing steps, enabling us to resolve two distinct stages of processing with MEG multivariate pattern classification. The first processing stage was the rapid activation cascade of the bottom-up sweep, which terminated early as visual stimuli were presented at progressively faster rates. The second stage was the emergence of categorical information with peak latency that shifted later in time with progressively faster stimulus presentations, indexing time-consuming recurrent processing. Using MEG-fMRI fusion with representational similarity, we localized recurrent signals in early visual cortex. Together, our findings segregated an initial bottom-up sweep from subsequent feedback processing, and revealed the neural signature of increased recurrent processing demands for challenging viewing conditions.</description>

	<description>Motion detection represents one of the critical tasks of the visual system and has motivated a large body of research. However, is remain unclear precisely why the response of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to simple artificial stimuli does not predict their response to complex naturalistic stimuli. To explore this topic, we use Motion Clouds (MC), which are synthetic textures that preserve properties of natural images and are merely parameterized, in particular by modulating the spatiotemporal spectrum complexity of the stimulus by adjusting the frequency bandwidths. By stimulating the retina of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus with MC we show that the RGCs respond to increasingly complex stimuli by narrowing their adjustment curves in response to movement. At the level of the population, complex stimuli produce a sparser code while preserving movement information; therefore, the stimuli are encoded more efficiently. Interestingly, these properties were observed throughout different populations of RGCs. Thus, our results reveal that the response at the level of RGCs is modulated by the naturalness of the stimulus - in particular for motion - which suggests that the tuning to the statistics of natural images already emerges at the level of the retina.</description>

	<description>Auditory stimulus reconstruction is a technique that finds the best approximation of the acoustic stimulus from the population of evoked neural activity. Reconstructing speech from the human auditory cortex creates the possibility of a speech neuroprosthetic to establish a direct communication with the brain and has been shown to be possible in both overt and covert conditions. However, the low quality of the reconstructed speech has severely limited the utility of this method for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we combined the recent advances in deep learning with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies to reconstruct closed-set intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex. We investigated the dependence of reconstruction accuracy on linear and nonlinear regression methods and the acoustic representation that is used as the target of reconstruction, including spectrogram and speech synthesis parameters. In addition, we compared the reconstruction accuracy from low and high neural frequency ranges. Our results show that a deep neural network model that directly estimates the parameters of a speech synthesizer from all neural frequencies achieves the highest subjective and objective scores on a digit recognition task, improving the intelligibility by 65% over the baseline. These results demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning and speech synthesis algorithms for designing the next generation of speech BCI systems, which not only can restore communications for paralyzed patients but also have the potential to transform human-computer interaction technologies.</description>

	<description>A consensus on the number of morphologically different types of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex has not yet been reached, despite over a century of anatomical studies. This is because of a lack of agreement on the subjective classifications of neuron types, which is based on expert analyses of neuronal morphologies: the shapes of somata, dendrites, and axons. Even for neurons that are visually different to non-experts, there is no common ground to consistently distinguish morphological types. We found that objective classification is possible with methods from algebraic topology, and that the dendritic arbor is sufficient for reliable identification of distinct types of PCs. We also provide a solution for the more challenging problem of whether two similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Using this scheme, we objectively identify seventeen types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.</description>

	<description>Autism Spectrum Conditions (henceforth, autism) are a diverse set of neurodevelopmental phenotypes with a complex genetic basis. Idiopathic autism, characterized by a diagnosis of autism not caused by a known genetic variant, is associated with hundreds of rare and common genetic variants each of small effect. Functional genomics analyses of post mortem brain tissue have identified convergent atypical gene correlation networks in idiopathic autism. However, post mortem tissue is difficult to obtain and is susceptible to unknown confounding factors related to the cause of death and to storage conditions. To circumvent these limitations, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from hair follicles of idiopathic autistic individuals and made iPSC-derived neurons, to investigate its usefulness as a substitute for post mortem brain tissue. Plucking hair follicles is a relatively painless and ethical procedure, and hair samples can be obtained from anyone. Functional genomics analyses were used as a replicable analysis pipeline to assess efficacy of iPSC-derived neurons. Gene expression networks, previously identified in adult autism brains, were atypical in the iPSC autism neural cultures in this study. These included those associated with neuronal maturation, synaptic maturation, immune response and inflammation, and gene regulatory mechanisms. In addition, GABRA4, HTR7, ROBO1 and SLITRK5 were atypically expressed among genes previously associated with autism. A drawback of this study was its small sample size, reflecting practical challenges in generating iPSCs from patient cohorts. We conclude that, using rigorous functional genomics analyses, atypical molecular processes seen in the adult autistic post-mortem brain can be modelled in hair follicle iPSC-derived neurons. There is thus potential for scaling up of autism transcriptome studies using an iPSC-based model system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Development of white matter fibre density and morphology over childhood: a longitudinal fixel-based analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/342097v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/342097v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Purpose: White matter fibre development in childhood involves dynamic changes to microstructural organisation driven by increasing axon diameter, density, and myelination. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies that have quantified advanced diffusion metrics to identify regions of accelerated fibre maturation, particularly across the early pubertal period. We applied a novel longitudinal fixel-based analysis (FBA) framework, in order to estimate microscopic and macroscopic white matter changes over time. Methods: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired for 59 typically developing children (27 female) aged 9-13 years at two time-points approximately 16 months apart (time-point 1: M = 10.4, SD = 0.4 years, time-point 2: M = 11.7, SD = 0.5 years). Whole brain FBA was performed using the connectivity-based fixel enhancement method, to assess longitudinal changes in fibre microscopic density and macroscopic morphological measures, and how these changes are affected by sex, pubertal stage, and pubertal progression. Follow-up analyses were performed in sub-regions of the corpus callosum to confirm the main findings using a Bayesian repeated measures approach. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in fibre density over time localised to medial and posterior commissural and association fibres, including the forceps major and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus. Increases in fibre cross-section were substantially more widespread. The rate of fibre development was not associated with age or sex. In addition, there was no significant relationship between pubertal stage or progression and longitudinal fibre development over time. Follow-up Bayesian analyses were performed to confirm the findings, which supported the null effect of the longitudinal pubertal comparison. Conclusion: Using a novel longitudinal fixel-based analysis framework, we demonstrate that white matter fibre density and fibre cross-section increased within a 16-month scan rescan period in specific regions. The observed increases might reflect increasing axonal diameter or axon count. Pubertal stage or progression did not influence the rate of fibre development in the early stages of puberty. Future work should focus on quantifying these measures across a wider age range to capture the full spectrum of fibre development across the pubertal period.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Reversing allosteric communication: From detecting allosteric sites to inducing and tuning targeted allosteric response</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Ven Tee, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky&lt;/p&gt;

The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However, despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods, which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for “traditional” orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling, we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication, according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility hypothesis is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery, which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the “reverse perturbation” hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins, then, on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that, in addition to known allosteric sites, the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions, which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication, and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site’s structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/13RpS-9zFXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Evolution of chemokine receptors is driven by mutations in the sodium binding site</title>

Chemokines and their receptors (members of the GPCR super-family) are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes and diseases; thus, understanding the specificity of the chemokine receptor family could help develop new receptor specific drugs. Here, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the emergence of the chemokine receptors. Based on GPCR hierarchical classification, we analyzed nested GPCR sets with an eigen decomposition approach of the sequence covariation matrix and determined three key residues whose mutation was crucial for the emergence of the chemokine receptors and their subsequent divergence into homeostatic and inflammatory receptors. These residues are part of the allosteric sodium binding site. Their structural and functional roles were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of CXCR4 and CCR5 as prototypes of homeostatic and inflammatory chemokine receptors, respectively. This study indicates that the three mutations crucial for the evolution of the chemokine receptors dramatically altered the sodium binding mode. In CXCR4, the sodium ion is tightly bound by four protein atoms and one water molecule. In CCR5, the sodium ion is mobile within the binding pocket and moves between different sites involving from one to three protein atoms and two to five water molecules. Analysis of chemokine receptor evolution reveals that a highly constrained sodium binding site characterized most ancient receptors, and that the constraints were subsequently loosened during the divergence of this receptor family. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of the chemokine receptor functions and mechanisms of action.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHjAbuefwKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stochastic shielding and edge importance for Markov chains with timescale separation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Deena R. Schmidt, Roberto F. Galán, Peter J. Thomas&lt;/p&gt;

Nerve cells produce electrical impulses (“spikes”) through the coordinated opening and closing of ion channels. Markov processes with voltage-dependent transition rates capture the stochasticity of spike generation at the cost of complex, time-consuming simulations. Schmandt and Galán introduced a novel method, based on the stochastic shielding approximation, as a fast, accurate method for generating approximate sample paths with excellent first and second moment agreement to exact stochastic simulations. We previously analyzed the mathematical basis for the method’s remarkable accuracy, and showed that for models with a Gaussian noise approximation, the stationary variance of the occupancy at each vertex in the ion channel state graph could be written as a sum of distinct contributions from each edge in the graph. We extend this analysis to arbitrary discrete population models with first-order kinetics. The resulting decomposition allows us to rank the “importance” of each edge’s contribution to the variance of the current under stationary conditions. In most cases, transitions between open (conducting) and closed (non-conducting) states make the greatest contributions to the variance, but there are exceptions. In a 5-state model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, at low agonist concentration, a pair of “hidden” transitions (between two closed states) makes a greater contribution to the variance than any of the open-closed transitions. We exhaustively investigate this “edge importance reversal” phenomenon in simplified 3-state models, and obtain an exact formula for the contribution of each edge to the variance of the open state. Two conditions contribute to reversals: the opening rate should be faster than all other rates in the system, and the closed state leading to the opening rate should be sparsely occupied. When edge importance reversal occurs, current fluctuations are dominated by a slow noise component arising from the hidden transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o95TRa66Blg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The mechanistic details underlying the assembly of rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis and how they segregate from each other to act as individually mobile units remain largely unknown. Here, we construct a coarse-grained physical model of chromosomal DNA and condensins, a class of large protein complexes that plays key roles in these processes. We assume that condensins have two molecular activities: consecutive loop formation in DNA and inter-condensin attractions. Our simulation demonstrates that both of these activities and their balancing acts are essential for the efficient shaping and segregation of mitotic chromosomes. Our results also demonstrate that the shaping and segregation processes are strongly correlated, implying their mechanistic coupling during mitotic chromosome assembly. Our results highlight the functional importance of inter-condensin attractions in chromosome shaping and segregation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P3LOaFhEytc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal blood disorder characterized by hemolysis and a high risk of thrombosis, that is due to a deficiency in several cell surface proteins that prevent complement activation. Its origin has been traced to a somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene within hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, to date the question of how this mutant clone expands in size to contribute significantly to hematopoiesis remains under debate. One hypothesis posits the existence of a selective advantage of PIG-A mutated cells due to an immune mediated attack on normal HSC, but the evidence supporting this hypothesis is inconclusive. An alternative (and simpler) explanation attributes clonal expansion to neutral drift, in which case selection neither favours nor inhibits expansion of PIG-A mutated HSC. Here we examine the implications of the neutral drift model by numerically evolving a Markov chain for the probabilities of all possible outcomes, and investigated the possible occurrence and evolution, within this framework, of multiple independently arising clones within the HSC pool. Predictions of the model agree well with the known incidence of the disease and average age at diagnosis. Notwithstanding the slight difference in clonal expansion rates between our results and those reported in the literature, our model results lead to a relative stability of clone size when averaging multiple cases, in accord with what has been observed in human trials. The probability of a patient harbouring a second clone in the HSC pool was found to be extremely low (~10-8). Thus our results suggest that in clinical cases of PNH where two independent clones of mutant cells are observed, only one of those is likely to have originated in the HSC pool.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xkz6PT1hV1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Increased Axonal Bouton Stability during Learning in the Mouse Model of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;-duplication syndrome is an X-linked form of syndromic autism caused by genomic duplication of the region encoding Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. Mice overexpressing &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; demonstrate social impairment, behavioral inflexibility, and altered patterns of learning and memory. Previous work showed abnormally increased stability of dendritic spines formed during motor training in the apical tuft of primary motor cortex (area M1) corticospinal neurons in the MECP2-duplication mouse model. In the current study, we measure the structural plasticity of axonal boutons in Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 during motor training. In wild-type littermate control mice we find that during rotarod training, bouton formation rate changes minimally, if at all, while bouton elimination rate more than doubles. Notably, the observed upregulation in bouton elimination with training is absent in &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;-duplication mice. This result provides further evidence of an imbalance between structural stability and plasticity in this form of syndromic autism. Furthermore, the observation that axonal bouton elimination more than doubles with motor training in wild-type animals contrasts with the increase of dendritic spine consolidation observed in corticospinal neurons at the same layer. This dissociation suggests that different area M1 microcircuits may manifest different patterns of structural synaptic plasticity during motor training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Abnormal balance between synaptic stability and plasticity is a feature of several autism spectrum disorders, often corroborated by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of dendritic spine turnover. Here we provide the first evidence that abnormally increased stability of axonal boutons, the presynaptic component of excitatory synapses, occurs during motor training in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; duplication syndrome mouse model of autism. In contrast, in normal controls, axonal bouton elimination in L5 pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 more than doubles with motor training. The fact that axonal projection boutons get eliminated, while corticospinal dendritic spines get consolidated with motor training in layer 1 of area M1, suggests that structural plasticity manifestations differ across different M1 microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human neurons expressing mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease are becoming more widely available. Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study establishes a new automated live cell imaging method that was used to analyze human motor neurons in the process of dying after trophic factor withdrawal. Our aim was to provide an alternative to traditional endpoint survival assays by determining morphologic changes that predate death. This was accomplished by tracking large numbers of individual motor neurons over long periods of time. We identified features of motor neurons that distinguish between those neurons that can fully recover from the early stages of degeneration and those that are committed to death. Our research is of clear interest to neuroscientists interested in disease and improved methods for discovering effective therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A simple blind-denoising filter inspired by electrically coupled photoreceptors in the retina. (arXiv:1806.05882v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptors in the retina are coupled by electrical synapses called &quot;gap
junctions&quot;. It has long been established that gap junctions increase the
signal-to-noise ratio of photoreceptors. Inspired by electrically coupled
photoreceptors, we introduced a simple filter, the PR-filter, with only one
variable. On BSD68 dataset, PR-filter showed outstanding performance in SSIM
during blind denoising tasks. It also significantly improved the performance of
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network blind denosing on non-Gaussian
noise. The performance of keeping more details might be attributed to small
receptive field of the photoreceptors.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Role of Sensory Uncertainty in Simple Perceptual Organization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350082v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Perceptual organization is the process of grouping scene elements into whole entities, for example line segments into contours. Uncertainty in grouping arises from scene ambiguity and sensory noise. Some classic Gestalt principles of perceptual organization have been re-framed in terms of Bayesian models, whereby the observer computes the probability that the whole entity is present. Previous studies that proposed a Bayesian interpretation of perceptual organization, however, have ignored sensory uncertainty, despite the fact that accounting for the current level of uncertainty is the main signature of Bayesian decision making. Crucially, trial-by-trial manipulation of sensory uncertainty is necessary to test whether humans perform optimal Bayesian inference in perceptual organization, as opposed to using some non-Bayesian heuristic. We distinguish between these hypotheses in an elementary form of perceptual organization, namely judging whether two line segments separated by an occluder are collinear. We manipulate sensory uncertainty by varying retinal eccentricity. A Bayes-optimal observer would take the level of sensory uncertainty into account - in a very specific way - in deciding whether a measured offset between the line segments is due to non-collinearity or to sensory noise. We find that people deviate slightly but systematically from Bayesian optimality, while still performing &quot;probabilistic computation&quot; in the sense that they take into account sensory uncertainty via a heuristic rule. Our work contributes to an understanding of the role of sensory uncertainty in higher-order perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Causal inference for spatial constancy across whole-body motion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/350066v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The brain can estimate the amplitude and direction of self-motion by integrating multiple sources of sensory information, and use this estimate to update object positions in order to provide us with a stable representation of the world. A strategy to improve the precision of the object position estimate would be to integrate this internal estimate and the sensory feedback about the object position based on their reliabilities. Integrating these cues, however, would only be optimal under the assumption that the object has not moved in the world during the intervening body displacement. Therefore, the brain would have to infer whether the internal estimate and the feedback relate to a same external position (stable object), and integrate and/or segregate these cues based on this inference - a process that can be modeled as Bayesian Causal inference. To test this hypothesis, we designed a spatial updating task across passive whole-body translation in complete darkness, in which participants (n=11), seated on a vestibular sled, had to remember the world-fixed position of a visual target. Immediately after the translation, a second target (feedback) was briefly flashed around the estimated &quot;updated&quot; target location, and participants had to report the initial target location. We found that the participants' responses were systematically biased toward the position of the second target position for relatively small but not for large differences between the &quot;updated&quot; and the second target location. This pattern was better captured by a Bayesian causal inference model than by alternative models that would always either integrate or segregate the internally-updated target position and the visual feedback. Our results suggest that the brain implicitly represents the posterior probability that the internally updated estimate and the sensory feedback come from a common cause, and use this probability to weigh the two sources of information in mediating spatial constancy across whole-body motion.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Reward and Punishment Effects Induced by Associative Learning</title>

	<description>While reward associative learning has been studied extensively across different species, punishment avoidance learning has received far less attention. Of particular interest is how the two types of learning change perceptual processing of the learned stimuli. We designed a task that required participants to learn the association of emotionally neutral images with reward, punishment, and no incentive value outcomes through trial-and-error. During learning, participants received monetary reward, neutral outcomes or avoided punishment by correctly identifying corresponding images. Results showed an early bias in favor of learning reward associations, in the form of higher accuracy and fewer trials needed to reach learning criterion. We subsequently assessed electrophysiological learning effects with a task in which participants viewed the stimuli with no feedback or reinforcement. Critically, we found modulation of two early event-related potential components for reward images: the frontocentral P2 (170 - 230 ms) and the anterior N2/Early Anterior Positivity (N2/EAP; 210 - 310 ms). We suggest that reward associations may change stimuli detection and incentive salience as indexed by P2 and N2/EAP. We also reported, on an exploratory basis, a late negativity with frontopolar distribution enhanced by punishment images.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the Orientation of Entorhinal Grids</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/349373v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In the groundbreaking paper that eventually led to the 2014 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine, Hafting et al. (2005) reported that when rats forage for chocolate crumbs in a large open field, some neurons in their entorhinal cortex, called grid cells, exhibit crystalline-like responses to animal position, i.e. grids. Among several key findings documented in this article, the authors noted for the first time that the grids of different neurons can be tilted relative to each other, particularly if these neurons are far apart. In support of this claim, the researchers illustrated two neuronal subpopulations with a 7-10 degrees difference in their grid orientations. Since these data are available online, we were able to reexamine these findings. Here we report several clarifications to the original observations of Hafting et al. First, we show that the relationship between the entorhinal grids is more complex than a single rotation: for the neuronal subpopulations analyzed by Hafting et al., one axis of the hexagonal grid is indeed tilted, but the other axes are not. Second, we show that local ensembles of entorhinal neurons are preferentially tuned to certain directions defined by the grid; this effect is unclear when single neurons are analyzed in isolation. Third, we argue that rat navigation traces are patterned instead of being random. For example, the orientation of the vector field representing average velocity appears to match the orientation of the neuronal grid. Overall, our observations indicate that additional insights into the function of entorhinal grids could be provided by ensemble-level analyses and thorough examination of the connection between the navigation behavior and neuronal patterns.</description>

	<description>Long calibration time hinders the feasibility of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). If other subjects' data were used for training the classifier, BCI-based neurofeedback practice could start without the initial calibration. Here, we compare methods for inter-subject decoding of left- vs. right-hand motor imagery (MI) from MEG and EEG. Six methods were tested on data involving MEG and EEG measurements of healthy participants. Only subjects with good within-subject accuracies were selected for inter-subject decoding. Three methods were based on the Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) algorithm, and three others on logistic regression with l1 - or l2,1 -norm regularization. The decoding accuracy was evaluated using 1) MI and 2) passive movements (PM) for training, separately for MEG and EEG. When the classifier was trained by MI, the best accuracies across subjects (mean 70.6% for MEG, 67.7% for EEG) were obtained using multi-task learning (MTL) with logistic regression and l2,1-norm regularization. MEG yielded slightly better average accuracies than EEG. When PM were used for training, none of the inter-subject methods yielded above chance level (58.7%) accuracy. In conclusion, MTL and training with other subject's MI is efficient for inter-subject decoding of MI. Passive movements of other subjects are likely suboptimal for training the MI classifiers.</description>

	<description>Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (Drd2) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors co-expression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough reexamination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Current findings suggest that accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain disrupt synaptic function in hippocampal–cortical neuronal networks leading to impairment in cognitive and affective functions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Development of new disease-modifying AD drugs are challenging due to the lack of predictive animal models and efficacy assays. In the present study we recorded neural activity in TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model with a full array of AD pathological features, including age-dependent Aβ accumulation, tauopathy, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments. Under urethane anesthesia, TgF344-AD rats showed significant age-dependent decline in brainstem-elicited hippocampal theta oscillation and decreased theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling comparing to their age-matched wild-type counterparts. In freely-behaving condition, the power of hippocampal theta oscillation and gamma power during sharp-wave ripples were significantly lower in TgF344-AD rats. Additionally, these rats showed impaired coherence in both intercortical and hippocampal–cortical network dynamics, and increased incidence of paroxysmal high-voltage spindles, which occur during awake, behaviorally quiescent state. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated impairments in sensory processing, having diminished auditory gating and 40-Hz auditory evoked steady-state response. The observed differences in neurophysiological activities in TgF344-AD rats, which mirror several abnormalities described in AD patients, may be used as promising markers to monitor disease-modifying therapies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sustained Activation of Postsynaptic 5-HT2A Receptors Gates Plasticity at Prefrontal Cortex Synapses</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in many high-level cognitive processes. It is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, which profoundly influence PFC activity. Among the 5-HT receptors abundantly expressed in PFC, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors located in dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons control neuronal excitability and mediate the psychotropic effects of psychedelic hallucinogens, but their impact on glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a 20-min exposure of mouse PFC slices to serotonin or the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces a long-lasting depression of evoked AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. DOI-elicited long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission is absent in slices from 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-deficient mice, is rescued by viral expression of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in pyramidal neurons and occludes electrically induced long-term depression. Furthermore, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation promotes phosphorylation of GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser&lt;sup&gt;880&lt;/sup&gt; and AMPA receptor internalization, indicating common mechanisms with electrically induced LTD. These findings provide one of the first examples of LTD gating under the control of a G protein-coupled receptor that might lead to imbalanced synaptic plasticity and memory impairment following a nonphysiological elevation of extracellular serotonin.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The manual evaluation, classification and counting of biological objects demands for an enormous expenditure of time and subjective human input may be a source of error. Investigating the shape of red blood cells (RBCs) in microcapillary Poiseuille flow, we overcome this drawback by introducing a convolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant shape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the so-called ‘slipper’ and ‘croissant’ shapes depending on the prevailing flow conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method, we are able to find the transition point between both ‘phases’ of stable shapes which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations. Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable results. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MySkoXXfdsE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The considerable difficulty encountered in reproducing the results of published dynamical models limits validation, exploration and reuse of this increasingly large biomedical research resource. To address this problem, we have developed Tellurium Notebook, a software system for model authoring, simulation, and teaching that facilitates building reproducible dynamical models and reusing models by 1) providing a notebook environment which allows models, Python code, and narrative to be intermixed, 2) supporting the COMBINE archive format during model development for capturing model information in an exchangeable format and 3) enabling users to easily simulate and edit public COMBINE-compliant models from public repositories to facilitate studying model dynamics, variants and test cases. Tellurium Notebook, a Python–based Jupyter–like environment, is designed to seamlessly inter-operate with these community standards by automating conversion between COMBINE standards formulations and corresponding in–line, human–readable representations. Thus, Tellurium brings to systems biology the strategy used by other literate notebook systems such as Mathematica. These capabilities allow users to edit every aspect of the standards–compliant models and simulations, run the simulations in–line, and re–export to standard formats. We provide several use cases illustrating the advantages of our approach and how it allows development and reuse of models without requiring technical knowledge of standards. Adoption of Tellurium should accelerate model development, reproducibility and reuse.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZuHaIPVjBo4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Accurate and reliable forecasts of seasonal epidemics of infectious disease can assist in the design of countermeasures and increase public awareness and preparedness. This article describes two main contributions we made recently toward this goal: a novel approach to probabilistic modeling of surveillance time series based on “delta densities”, and an optimization scheme for combining output from multiple forecasting methods into an adaptively weighted ensemble. Delta densities describe the probability distribution of the change between one observation and the next, conditioned on available data; chaining together nonparametric estimates of these distributions yields a model for an entire trajectory. Corresponding distributional forecasts cover more observed events than alternatives that treat the whole season as a unit, and improve upon multiple evaluation metrics when extracting key targets of interest to public health officials. Adaptively weighted ensembles integrate the results of multiple forecasting methods, such as delta density, using weights that can change from situation to situation. We treat selection of optimal weightings across forecasting methods as a separate estimation task, and describe an estimation procedure based on optimizing cross-validation performance. We consider some details of the data generation process, including data revisions and holiday effects, both in the construction of these forecasting methods and when performing retrospective evaluation. The delta density method and an adaptively weighted ensemble of other forecasting methods each improve significantly on the next best ensemble component when applied separately, and achieve even better cross-validated performance when used in conjunction.
We submitted real-time forecasts based on these contributions as part of CDC’s 2015/2016 FluSight Collaborative Comparison. Among the fourteen submissions that season, this system was ranked by CDC as the most accurate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vgnec48BpkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Class I members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolutionarily appeared just prior to the advent of neuronal like cells and have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single Class I TRIM in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and the mammalian Class I TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the guidance cue netrin, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Opitz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often intellectual disability. We find that although TRIM67 is the least studied vertebrate Class I TRIM, it is the most evolutionarily conserved. Here we show that mammalian TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions during development and adulthood. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt;. While viable, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; exhibit abnormal anatomy of specific brain regions, including hypotrophy of the hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, and thinning of forebrain commissures. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice display impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function, and sensorimotor gating, whereas several other behaviors remain intact. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Pharmacological Dopamine Manipulation Does Not Alter Reward-Based Improvements in Memory Retention during a Visuomotor Adaptation Task</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Motor adaptation tasks investigate our ability to adjust motor behaviours to an ever-changing and unpredictable world. Previous work has shown that punishment-based feedback delivered during a visuomotor adaptation task enhances error-reduction, whereas reward increases memory retention. While the neural underpinnings of the influence of punishment on the adaptation phase remain unclear, reward has been hypothesized to increase retention through dopaminergic mechanisms. We directly tested this hypothesis through pharmacological manipulation of the dopaminergic system. 96 young healthy human participants were tested in a placebo-controlled double-blind between-subjects design in which they adapted to a 40-degree visuomotor rotation under reward or punishment conditions. We confirmed previous evidence that reward enhances retention, but the dopamine precursor levodopa or the dopamine antagonist haloperidol failed to influence performance. We reason that such a negative result could be due to experimental limitations or it may suggest that the effect of reward on motor memory retention is not driven by dopaminergic processes. This provides further insight regarding the role of motivational feedback in optimizing motor learning, and the basis for further decomposing the effect of reward on the subprocesses known to underlie motor adaptation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Motor adaptation tasks investigate our ability to rapidly adjust motor behaviours. However, these adjustments are transient and the learnt behavior is quickly forgotten. Previous work has found that reward-based feedback can enhance the retention of a newly acquired motor behavior and hypothesised that this effect was dependent on dopamine. Here, we confirmed that reward increases the retention of motor memories, but found that this was not influenced by drugs that altered dopamine availability in the brain. Therefore, these findings fail to confirm a role for dopamine during reward-based improvements in motor retention, and highlight possible limitations of using dopaminergic stimulation to optimize motor memory retention in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Optogenetic Study of Anterior Bnst and Basomedial Amygdala Projections to the Ventromedial Hypothalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0204-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0204-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The basomedial amygdala (BM) influences the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) through direct glutamatergic projections as well as indirectly, through the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). However, BM and BNSTa axons end in a segregated fashion in VMH. BM projects to the core of VMH, where VMH’s projection cells are located, whereas BNSTa projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa are unknown. To study this question, we recorded the responses of VMH’s shell and core neurons to the optogenetic activation of BM or BNSTa inputs in transgenic mice that selectively express cre-recombinase in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic BM inputs fired most core neurons but elicited no response in GABAergic shell neurons. Following BM infusions of AAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2-mCherry in Vgat-ires-Cre-Ai6 mice, no anterograde labeling was observed in the VMH, suggesting that GABAergic BM neurons do not project to the VMH. In contrast, BNSTa sent mostly GABAergic projections that inhibited both, shell and core neurons. However, BNSTa-evoked IPSPs had a higher amplitude in shell neurons. Since we also found that activation of GABAergic shell neurons causes an inhibition of core neurons, these results suggest that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, BNSTa inputs could elicit a net inhibition or disinhibition of core neurons. Thus, the dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa imparts flexibility to this regulator of defensive and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a critical component of the innate defense network, is regulated by the basomedial amygdala (BM), which supplies non-olfactory information to the VMH, and BNST, another structure mediating defensive behaviors and a recipient of BM inputs. BM projects to the core of VMH, where its projection cells are located, whereas BNST projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNST are unknown. Our results indicate that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, the influence of BNST can shift from an inhibition to a disinhibition of core neurons, thus imparting flexibility to this innate defensive network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Age-Related Declines in Prefrontal Cortical Expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors That Support Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0164-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Glutamate signaling is essential for the persistent neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) that enables working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a diverse class of proteins that modulate excitatory neurotransmission via both presynaptic regulation of extracellular glutamate levels and postsynaptic modulation of ion channels on dendritic spines. This receptor class is of significant therapeutic interest for treatment of cognitive disorders associated with glutamate dysregulation. Working memory impairment and cortical hypoexcitability are both associated with advanced aging. Whether aging modifies PFC mGluR expression, and the extent to which any such alterations are regionally or subtype specific, however, is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether specific mGluRs in PFC are critical for working memory, and thus, whether altered mGluR expression in aging or disease is sufficient to play a &lt;i&gt;causative&lt;/i&gt; role in working memory decline. Experiments in the current study first evaluated the effects of age on medial PFC (mPFC) mGluR expression using biochemical and molecular approaches in rats. Of the eight mGluRs examined, only mGluR5, mGluR3, and mGluR4 were significantly reduced in the aged PFC. The reductions in mGluR3 and mGluR5 (but not mGluR4) were observed in both mRNA and protein, and were selectively localized to the prelimbic (PrL), but not infralimbic (IL), subregion of PFC. Finally, pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 or mGluR2/3 using selective antagonists directed to PrL significantly impaired working memory without influencing non-mnemonic aspects of task performance. Together, these data implicate attenuated expression of PFC mGluR5 and mGluR3 in the impaired working memory associated with advanced ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Working memory is impaired in several neuropsychiatric disorders and advanced aging. Glutamate is essential for persistent cellular activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) theorized to maintain working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are well-positioned to coordinate glutamate signaling at PFC synapses; however, studies to date have not yet systematically investigated the contributions of mGluR subtypes to normal working memory and PFC aging. This study shows that aging is accompanied by loss of PFC mGluR2/3 and mGluR5 mRNA and protein, and that pharmacological inhibition of these mGluR subtypes is sufficient to impair working memory. These findings suggest that mGluRs have a normal role in working memory and could serve as a target for treatment of cognitive disorders characterized by PFC dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Large Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident Pool of TRPM1 in Retinal on Bipolar Cells</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The chemical signal of light onset, a decrease in glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors, is processed by a post-synaptic G-protein signaling cascade in ON-bipolar cells. The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, along with other cascade elements, is localized synaptically at the bipolar cell dendritic tips. The effector ion channel protein TRPM1, in contrast, is located not only at the dendritic tips but also in bipolar cell bodies and axons. Little is known about the intracellular localization of TRPM1, or its trafficking route to the dendritic tip plasma membrane. Recombinant TRPM1 expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, with little or none detected at the plasma membrane. In mouse retina, somatic TRPM1 was similarly intracellular, and not at the plasma membrane. Labeling of ER membranes by expression of a fluorescent marker showed that in bipolar cells the ER extends into axons and dendrites, but not dendritic tips. In cell bodies, TRPM1 colocalized with the ER, and not with the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescence protease protection assays with TRPM1-GFP fusions in heterologous cells revealed that the N- and C-termini are both accessible to the cytoplasm, consistent with the transmembrane domain topology of related TRP channels. These results indicate that the majority of TRPM1 is present in the ER, from which it can potentially be transported to the dendritic tips as needed for ON light responses. The excess of ER-resident TRPM1 relative to the amount needed at the dendritic tips suggests a potential new function for TRPM1 in the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Retinal bipolar cells of the ON subtype detect signals from both rod and cone photoreceptors, and are required for dim light vision. Little is known about the secretory pathway in these cells, or the trafficking of synaptic signal cascade proteins to their destination at the dendritic tip plasma membrane. The ion channel protein TRPM1 is required for the depolarizing light response of ON bipolar cells. However, in addition to its post-synaptic location at the bipolar cell dendritic tips, TRPM1 is also present in cell bodies and axons. Our results show that somatic TRPM1 is intracellular and located in the ER, and not at the plasma membrane, suggesting that plasma membrane insertion occurs specifically at the dendrites or dendritic tips.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Kuramoto model for excitation-inhibition-based oscillations. (arXiv:1806.05279v1 [nlin.AO])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Kuramoto model (KM) is a theoretical paradigm for investigating the
emergence of rhythmic activity in large populations of oscillators. A
remarkable example of rhythmogenesis is the feedback loop between excitatory
(E) and inhibitory (I) cells in large neuronal networks. Yet, although the
EI-feedback mechanism plays a central role in the generation of brain
oscillations, it remains unexplored whether the KM has enough biological
realism to describe it. Here we derive a two-population KM that fully accounts
for the onset of EI-based neuronal rhythms and that, as the original KM, is
analytically solvable to a large extent. Our results provide a powerful
theoretical tool for the analysis of large-scale neuronal oscillations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: fMRI Semantic Category Decoding using Linguistic Encoding of Word Embeddings. (arXiv:1806.05177v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The dispute of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been
argued in many scientific fields. Brain imaging studies have shown that the
spatial patterns of neural activation in the brain are correlated with thinking
about different semantic categories of words (for example, tools, animals, and
buildings) or when viewing the related pictures. In this paper, we present a
computational model that learns to predict the neural activation captured in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of test words. Unlike the
models with hand-crafted features that have been used in the literature, in
this paper we propose a novel approach wherein decoding models are built with
features extracted from popular linguistic encodings of Word2Vec, GloVe,
Meta-Embeddings in conjunction with the empirical fMRI data associated with
viewing several dozen concrete nouns. We compared these models with several
other models that use word features extracted from FastText, Randomly-generated
features, Mitchell's 25 features [1]. The experimental results show that the
predicted fMRI images using Meta-Embeddings meet the state-of-the-art
performance. Although models with features from GloVe and Word2Vec predict fMRI
images similar to the state-of-the-art model, model with features from
Meta-Embeddings predicts significantly better. The proposed scheme that uses
popular linguistic encoding offers a simple and easy approach for semantic
decoding from fMRI experiments.

	<description>The precise regulation of fluid and energy homeostasis is essential for survival. It is well appreciated that ingestive behaviors are tightly regulated by both peripheral sensory inputs and central appetite signals. With recent neurogenetic technologies, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of basic taste qualities, the molecular and/or cellular basis of taste sensing, and the central circuits for thirst and hunger. In this review, we first highlight the functional similarities and differences between mammalian and invertebrate taste processing.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanical evolution of DNA double-strand breaks in the nucleosome</title>

Double strand breaks (DSB) in the DNA backbone are the most lethal type of defect induced in the cell nucleus by chemical and radiation treatments of cancer. However, little is known about the outcomes of damage in nucleosomal DNA, and on its effects on damage repair. We performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics computer simulations of nucleosomes including a DSB at various sites, to characterize the early stages of the evolution of this DNA lesion. The damaged structures are studied by the essential dynamics of DNA and histones, and compared to the intact nucleosome, thus exposing key features of the interactions. All DSB configurations tend to remain compact, with only the terminal bases interacting with histone proteins. Umbrella sampling calculations show that broken DNA ends at the DSB must overcome a free-energy barrier to detach from the nucleosome core. Finally, by calculating the covariant mechanical stress, we demonstrate that the coupled bending and torsional stress can force the DSB free ends to open up straight, thus making it accessible to damage signalling proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TrSQAWSy52w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Hybrid stochastic framework predicts efficacy of prophylaxis against HIV: An example with different dolutegravir prophylaxis schemes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006155</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sulav Duwal, Laura Dickinson, Saye Khoo, Max von Kleist&lt;/p&gt;

To achieve the 90-90-90 goals set by UNAIDS, the number of new HIV infections needs to decrease to approximately 500,000 by 2020. One of the ‘five pillars’ to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to the once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, many next-generation regimen, including long-acting formulations, are currently investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not guide candidate selection, since it often fails to translate into clinical efficacy. On the other hand, quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires to conduct long (years) and large (N&amp;gt;1000 individuals) trials, precluding systematic evaluation of candidates and deployment strategies. To prioritize- and help design PrEP regimen, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological-, viral- and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Integrating the aforementioned factors, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). Combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP ‘on demand’ and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99–100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP ‘on demand’ prevented 79–84% infections and PEP &amp;gt;80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. While the simulation framework can easily be adapted to other PrEP candidates, our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v-VbLFXyYXc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Biomedical research has become a digital data–intensive endeavor, relying on secure and scalable computing, storage, and network infrastructure, which has traditionally been purchased, supported, and maintained locally. For certain types of biomedical applications, cloud computing has emerged as an alternative to locally maintained traditional computing approaches. Cloud computing offers users pay-as-you-go access to services such as hardware infrastructure, platforms, and software for solving common biomedical computational problems. Cloud computing services offer secure on-demand storage and analysis and are differentiated from traditional high-performance computing by their rapid availability and scalability of services. As such, cloud services are engineered to address big data problems and enhance the likelihood of data and analytics sharing, reproducibility, and reuse. Here, we provide an introductory perspective on cloud computing to help the reader determine its value to their own research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LKfBBSl42Rc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Combinatorial Expression of Grp and Neurod6 Defines Dopamine Neuron Populations with Distinct Projection Patterns and Disease Vulnerability</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine neurons project to numerous targets throughout the brain to modulate various behaviors and brain states. Within this small population of neurons exists significant heterogeneity based on physiology, circuitry, and disease susceptibility. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons can be subdivided based on gene expression; however, the extent to which genetic markers represent functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations has not been fully explored. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse dopamine neurons and validated studies showing that &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; are selective markers for dopaminergic subpopulations. Using a combination of multiplex fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology in mice of both sexes, we defined the anatomy, projection targets, physiological properties, and disease vulnerability of dopamine neurons based on &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; expression. We found that the combinatorial expression of &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; defines dopaminergic subpopulations with unique features. &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dopamine neurons reside in the ventromedial VTA, send projections to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, and have noncanonical physiological properties. &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Neurod6-&lt;/i&gt; dopamine neurons are found in the VTA as well as in the ventromedial portion of the SNc, where they project selectively to the dorsomedial striatum. &lt;i&gt;Grp-/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dopamine neurons represent a smaller VTA subpopulation, which is preferentially spared in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s disease. Together, our work provides detailed characterization of &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; expression in the midbrain and generates new insights into how these markers define functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The application of network techniques to the analysis of neural data has
greatly improved our ability to quantify and describe these rich interacting
systems. Among many important contributions, networks have proven useful in
identifying sets of node pairs that are densely connected and that collectively
support brain function. Yet the restriction to pairwise interactions prevents
us from realizing intrinsic topological features such as cavities within the
interconnection structure that may be just as crucial for proper function. To
detect and quantify these topological features we must turn to methods from
algebraic topology that encode data as a simplicial complex built of sets of
interacting nodes called simplices. On this substrate, we can then use the
relations between simplices and higher-order connectivity to expose cavities
within the complex, thereby summarizing its topological nature. Here we provide
an introduction to persistent homology, a fundamental method from applied
topology that builds a global descriptor of system structure by chronicling the
evolution of cavities as we move through a combinatorial object such as a
weighted network. We detail the underlying mathematics and perform
demonstrative calculations on the mouse structural connectome, electrical and
chemical synapses in \textit{C. elegans}, and genomic interaction data. Finally
we suggest avenues for future work and highlight new advances in mathematics
that appear ready for use in revealing the architecture and function of neural
systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from a connectome? We constructed a simplified model of the
first two stages of the fly visual system, the lamina and medulla. The
resulting hexagonal lattice convolutional network was trained using
backpropagation through time to perform object tracking in natural scene
videos. Networks initialized with weights from connectome reconstructions
automatically discovered well-known orientation and direction selectivity
properties in T4 neurons and their inputs, while networks initialized at random
did not. Our work is the first demonstration, that knowledge of the connectome
can enable in silico predictions of the functional properties of individual
neurons in a circuit, leading to an understanding of circuit function from
structure alone.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A new quantized ion channel model, called five-anchor model, is proposed
based on a simple hypothesis of the first principle of the protein beam in the
ion channel: the polarity of the protein beam can be changed by electron
transition. With this model, many unique properties and behaviors of ion
channels can be explained, including the real physical working mechanism of
optogenetics, the refractory period in activation of action potential, the
stochastic gating pattern of single ion channel and the nerve conductance
block. Meanwhile, this model is consistent with our previous C-P theory. In
this study, the probability calculus equation is amended and expanded to a more
general scenario, thus called a general probability for differentiation with
the probability calculus in C-P theory.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Among the more important hallmarks of human intelligence, which any
artificial general intelligence (AGI) should have, are the following. 1. It
must be capable of on-line learning, including with single/few trials. 2.
Memories/knowledge must be permanent over lifelong durations, safe from
catastrophic forgetting. Some confabulation, i.e., semantically plausible
retrieval errors, may gradually accumulate over time. 3. The time to both: a)
learn a new item, and b) retrieve the best-matching / most relevant item(s),
i.e., do similarity-based retrieval, must remain constant throughout the
lifetime. 4. The system should never become full: it must remain able to store
new information, i.e., make new permanent memories, throughout very long
lifetimes. No artificial computational system has been shown to have all these
properties. Here, we describe a neuromorphic associative memory model, Sparsey,
which does, in principle, possess them all. We cite prior results supporting
possession of hallmarks 1 and 3 and sketch an argument, hinging on strongly
recursive, hierarchical, part-whole compositional structure of natural data,
that Sparsey also possesses hallmarks 2 and 4.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Brain Activity and Network Interactions in the Impact of Internal Emotional Distraction</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotional distraction may come from the external world and from our mind, as internal distraction. Although external emotional distraction has been extensively investigated, less is known about the mechanisms associated with the impact of internal emotional distraction on cognitive performance, and those involved in coping with such distraction. These issues were investigated using a working memory task with emotional distraction, where recollected unpleasant autobiographical memories served as internal emotional distraction. Emotion regulation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus their attention either on or away from the emotional aspects of their memories. Behaviorally, focusing away from emotion was associated with better working memory performance than focusing on the recollected emotions. Functional MRI data showed reduced response in brain regions associated with the salience network, coupled with greater recruitment of executive prefrontal and memory-related temporoparietal regions, and with increased frontoparietal connectivity, when subjects focused on nonemotional contextual details of their memories. Finally, temporal dissociations were also identified between regions involved in self-referential (showing faster responses) versus context-related processing (showing delayed responses). These findings demonstrate that focused attention is an effective regulation strategy in coping with internal distraction, and are relevant for understanding clinical conditions where coping with distressing memories is dysfunctional.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A biophysical mechanism for preferred direction enhancement in fly motion vision</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006240</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Borst&lt;/p&gt;

Seeing the direction of motion is essential for survival of all sighted animals. Consequently, nerve cells that respond to visual stimuli moving in one but not in the opposite direction, so-called ‘direction-selective’ neurons, are found abundantly. In general, direction selectivity can arise by either signal amplification for stimuli moving in the cell’s preferred direction (‘preferred direction enhancement’), signal suppression for stimuli moving along the opposite direction (‘null direction suppression’), or a combination of both. While signal suppression can be readily implemented in biophysical terms by a hyperpolarization followed by a rectification corresponding to the nonlinear voltage-dependence of the Calcium channel, the biophysical mechanism for signal amplification has remained unclear so far. Taking inspiration from the fly, I analyze a neural circuit where a direction-selective ON-cell receives inhibitory input from an OFF cell on the preferred side of the dendrite, while excitatory ON-cells contact the dendrite centrally. This way, an ON edge moving along the cell’s preferred direction suppresses the inhibitory input, leading to a release from inhibition in the postsynaptic cell. The benefit of such a two-fold signal inversion lies in the resulting increase of the postsynaptic cell’s input resistance, amplifying its response to a subsequent excitatory input signal even with a passive dendrite, i.e. without voltage-gated ion channels. A motion detector implementing this mechanism together with null direction suppression shows a high degree of direction selectivity over a large range of temporal frequency, narrow directional tuning, and a large signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0wnUcwMjsc4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons are the targets of most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex. They have a wide variety of morphologies, and their morphology appears to be critical from the functional point of view. To further characterize dendritic spine geometry, we used in this paper over 7,000 individually 3D reconstructed dendritic spines from human cortical pyramidal neurons to group dendritic spines using model-based clustering. This approach uncovered six separate groups of human dendritic spines. To better understand the differences between these groups, the discriminative characteristics of each group were identified as a set of rules. Model-based clustering was also useful for simulating accurate 3D virtual representations of spines that matched the morphological definitions of each cluster. This mathematical approach could provide a useful tool for theoretical predictions on the functional features of human pyramidal neurons based on the morphology of dendritic spines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wlClIi7WzLw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A challenge in studying diverse multi-copy gene families is deciphering distinct functional types within immense sequence variation. Functional changes can in some cases be tracked through the evolutionary history of a gene family; however phylogenetic approaches are not possible in cases where gene families diversify primarily by recombination. We take a network theoretical approach to functionally classify the highly recombining &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; antigenic gene family of the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. We sample &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; DBLα sequence types from a local population in Ghana, and classify 9,276 of these variants into just 48 functional types. Our approach is to first decompose each sequence type into its constituent, recombining parts; we then use a stochastic block model to identify functional groups among the parts; finally, we classify the sequence types based on which functional groups they contain. This method for functional classification does not rely on an inferred phylogenetic history, nor does it rely on inferring function based on conserved sequence features. Instead, it infers functional similarity among recombining parts based on the sharing of similar co-occurrence interactions with other parts. This method can therefore group sequences that have undetectable sequence homology or even distinct origination. Describing these 48 &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; functional types allows us to simplify the antigenic diversity within our dataset by over two orders of magnitude. We consider how the &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; functional types are distributed in isolates, and find a nonrandom pattern reflecting that common &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; functional types are non-randomly distinct from one another in terms of their functional composition. The coarse-graining of &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; gene diversity into biologically meaningful functional groups has important implications for understanding the disease ecology and evolution of this system, as well as for designing effective epidemiological monitoring and intervention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bJL1bWAPlbo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Expectations Do Not Alter Early Sensory Processing during Perceptual Decision-Making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5632?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two factors play important roles in shaping perception: the allocation of selective attention to behaviorally relevant sensory features, and prior expectations about regularities in the environment. Signal detection theory proposes distinct roles of attention and expectation on decision-making such that attention modulates early sensory processing, whereas expectation influences the selection and execution of motor responses. Challenging this classic framework, recent studies suggest that expectations about sensory regularities enhance the encoding and accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making. However, it is possible, that these findings reflect well documented attentional modulations in visual cortex. Here, we tested this framework in a group of male and female human participants by examining how expectations about stimulus features (orientation and color) and expectations about motor responses impacted electroencephalography (EEG) markers of early sensory processing and the accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making (the early visual negative potential and the centro-parietal positive potential, respectively). We first demonstrate that these markers are sensitive to changes in the amount of sensory evidence in the display. Then we show, counter to recent findings, that neither marker is modulated by either feature or motor expectations, despite a robust effect of expectations on behavior. Instead, violating expectations about likely sensory features and motor responses impacts posterior alpha and frontal theta oscillations, signals thought to index overall processing time and cognitive conflict. These findings are inconsistent with recent theoretical accounts and suggest instead that expectations primarily influence decisions by modulating post-perceptual stages of information processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Expectations about likely features or motor responses play an important role in shaping behavior. Classic theoretical frameworks posit that expectations modulate decision-making by biasing late stages of decision-making including the selection and execution of motor responses. In contrast, recent accounts suggest that expectations also modulate decisions by improving the quality of early sensory processing. However, these effects could instead reflect the influence of selective attention. Here we examine the effect of expectations about sensory features and motor responses on a set of electroencephalography (EEG) markers that index early sensory processing and later post-perceptual processing. Counter to recent empirical results, expectations have little effect on early sensory processing but instead modulate EEG markers of time-on-task and cognitive conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Subthalamic Nucleus Neurons Differentially Encode Early and Late Aspects of Speech Production</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5620?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops mediate all motor behavior, yet little detail is known about the role of basal ganglia nuclei in speech production. Using intracranial recording during deep brain stimulation surgery in humans with Parkinson's disease, we tested the hypothesis that the firing rate of subthalamic nucleus neurons is modulated in sync with motor execution aspects of speech. Nearly half of 79 unit recordings exhibited firing-rate modulation during a syllable reading task across 12 subjects (male and female). Trial-to-trial timing of changes in subthalamic neuronal activity, relative to cue onset versus production onset, revealed that locking to cue presentation was associated more with units that decreased firing rate, whereas locking to speech onset was associated more with units that increased firing rate. These unique data indicate that subthalamic activity is dynamic during the production of speech, reflecting temporally-dependent inhibition and excitation of separate populations of subthalamic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The basal ganglia are widely assumed to participate in speech production, yet no prior studies have reported detailed examination of speech-related activity in basal ganglia nuclei. Using microelectrode recordings from the subthalamic nucleus during a single-syllable reading task, in awake humans undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, we show that the firing rate of subthalamic nucleus neurons is modulated in response to motor execution aspects of speech. These results are the first to establish a role for subthalamic nucleus neurons in encoding of aspects of speech production, and they lay the groundwork for launching a modern subfield to explore basal ganglia function in human speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurotrophin Responsiveness of Sympathetic Neurons Is Regulated by Rapid Mobilization of the p75 Receptor to the Cell Surface through TrkA Activation of Arf6</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5606?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5606?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) plays an integral role in patterning the sympathetic nervous system during development. Initially, p75NTR is expressed at low levels as sympathetic axons project toward their targets, which enables neurotrophin-3 (NT3) to activate TrkA receptors and promote growth. Upon reaching nerve growth factor (NGF) producing tissues, p75NTR is upregulated, resulting in formation of TrkA-p75 complexes, which are high-affinity binding sites selective for NGF, thereby blunting NT3 signaling. The level of p75NTR expressed on the neuron surface is instrumental in regulating trophic factor response; however, the mechanisms by which p75NTR expression is regulated are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, translation independent increase in surface expression of p75NTR in response to NGF in rat sympathetic neurons. p75NTR was mobilized to the neuron surface from GGA3-postitive vesicles through activation of the GTPase Arf6, which was stimulated by NGF, but not NT3 binding to TrkA. Arf6 activation required PI3 kinase activity and was prevented by an inhibitor of the cytohesin family of Arf6 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Overexpression of a constitutively active Arf6 mutant (Q67L) was sufficient to significantly increase surface expression of p75NTR even in the absence of NGF. Functionally, expression of active Arf6 markedly attenuated the ability of NT3 to promote neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, whereas the NGF response was unaltered. These data suggest that NGF activation of Arf6 through TrkA is critical for the increase in p75NTR surface expression that enables the switch in neurotrophin responsiveness during development in the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; p75NTR is instrumental in the regulation of neuronal survival and apoptosis during development and is also implicated as a contributor to aberrant neurodegeneration in numerous conditions. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate p75NTR surface availability may provide insight into how and why neurodegenerative processes manifest and reveal new therapeutic targets. Results from this study indicate a novel mechanism by which p75NTR can be rapidly shuttled to the cell surface from existing intracellular pools and explores a unique pathway by which NGF regulates the sympathetic innervation of target tissues, which has profound consequences for the function of these organs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Polyamine Modulation of Anticonvulsant Drug Response: A Potential Mechanism Contributing to Pharmacoresistance in Chronic Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5596?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5596?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the development of numerous novel anticonvulsant drugs, ~30% of epilepsy patients remain refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Many established and novel AEDs reduce hyperexcitability via voltage- and use-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. For the widely used anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ), use-dependent block of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels is significantly reduced both in experimental and human epilepsy. However, the molecular underpinnings of this potential cellular mechanism for pharmacoresistance have remained enigmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we describe the mechanism that leads to the emergence of CBZ-resistant Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. We focused on the endogenous polyamine system, which powerfully modulates Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in a use-dependent manner. We had shown previously that the intracellular polyamine spermine is reduced in chronic epilepsy, resulting in increased persistent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents. Because spermine and CBZ both bind use-dependently in spatial proximity within the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore, we hypothesized that spermine loss might also be related to diminished CBZ response. Using the pilocarpine model of refractory epilepsy in male rats and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we first replicated the reduction of use-dependent block by CBZ in chronically epileptic animals. We then substituted intracellular spermine via the patch pipette in different concentrations. Under these conditions, we found that exogenous spermine significantly rescues use-dependent block of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels by CBZ. These findings indicate that an unexpected modulatory mechanism, depletion of intracellular polyamines, leads both to increased persistent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and to diminished CBZ sensitivity of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. These findings could lead to novel strategies for overcoming pharmacoresistant epilepsy that target the polyamine system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pharmacoresistant epilepsy affects ~18 million people worldwide, and intense efforts have therefore been undertaken to uncover the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. One of the key known candidate mechanisms of pharmacoresistance has been a loss of use-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel block by the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ), both in human and experimental epilepsies. Despite intense scrutiny, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been elucidated. We now show that a loss of intracellular spermine in chronic epilepsy is a major causative factor leading to the development of CBZ-resistant Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents. This finding can be exploited both for the screening of anticonvulsants in expression systems, and for novel strategies to overcome pharmacoresistance that target the polyamine system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the hypothalamus is a principal mediator of the febrile response. However, the role of organic anion transporting polypeptide 2A1 (OATP2A1/&lt;i&gt;SLCO2A1&lt;/i&gt;), a prostaglandin transporter, in facilitating this response is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency on the body core temperature (Tc) and on the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in hypothalamus interstitial fluid (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt;) and CSF (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;csf&lt;/sub&gt;) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg/kg, i.p.)-treated mice of both sexes. &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice did not develop a febrile response. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;csf&lt;/sub&gt; was increased in &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;csf&lt;/sub&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice was well maintained at 5 h after LPS injection (1160 pg/ml) compared with &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice (316 pg/ml). A microdialysis study revealed that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt; peaked at 2 h after LPS injection in &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice (841 pg/ml), whereas the increase in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt; was negligible in &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma concentration in &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice (201 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that in &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice (54 pg/ml) at 1 h after LPS injection, whereas the two groups showed similar PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations in the hypothalamus. Strong Oatp2a1 immunoreactivity was observed in F4/80-positive microglia and perivascular cells and in brain capillary endothelial cells. The changes in Tc and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt; seen in LPS-injected &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice were partially attenuated in monocyte-/macrophage-specific &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Fl/Fl&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;LysM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Cre/+&lt;/sup&gt;) mice. Thus, OATP2A1 facilitates the LPS-induced febrile response by maintaining a high level of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt;, possibly by regulating PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion from F4/80-positive glial cells and/or facilitating PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport across the blood–brain barrier. These findings suggest that OATP2A1 is a useful therapeutic target for neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fever is a physiological response caused by pyrogen-induced release of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the hypothalamus, which plays a central role in regulating the set-point of body temperature. However, it is unclear whether the prostaglandin transporter OATP2A1/&lt;i&gt;SLCO2A1&lt;/i&gt; is involved in this response. We show here that LPS-induced fever is associated with increased PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in hypothalamus interstitial fluid (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt;), but not in CSF (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;csf&lt;/sub&gt;), by means of a microdialysis study in global &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;-knock-out mice and monocyte-/macrophage-specific &lt;i&gt;Slco2a1&lt;/i&gt;-knock-out mice. The results suggest that OATP2A1 serves as a regulator of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;isf&lt;/sub&gt; in F4/80-positive glial cells. OATP2A1 was detected immunohistochemically in brain capillary endothelial cells and, therefore, may also play a role in PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport across the blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Central Extended Amygdala Circuit That Modulates Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5567?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) have been implicated in maladaptive anxiety characteristics of anxiety disorders. However, the underlying circuit and cellular mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we show that mice with &lt;i&gt;Erbb4&lt;/i&gt; gene deficiency in somatostatin-expressing (SOM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons exhibit heightened anxiety as measured in the elevated plus maze test and the open field test, two assays commonly used to assess anxiety-related behaviors in rodents. Using a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, genetic, and pharmacological techniques, we demonstrate that the abnormal anxiety in the mutant mice is caused by enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs onto SOM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the central amygdala (CeA), and the resulting reduction in inhibition onto downstream SOM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the BNST. Notably, our results indicate that an increase in dynorphin signaling in SOM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CeA neurons mediates the paradoxical reduction in inhibition onto SOM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; BNST neurons, and that the consequent enhanced activity of SOM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; BNST neurons is both necessary for and sufficient to drive the elevated anxiety. Finally, we show that the elevated anxiety and the associated synaptic dysfunctions and increased dynorphin signaling in the CeA–BNST circuit of the &lt;i&gt;Erbb4&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice can be recapitulated by stress in wild-type mice. Together, our results unravel previously unknown circuit and cellular processes in the central extended amygdala that can cause maladaptive anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The central extended amygdala has been implicated in anxiety-related behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we found that somatostatin-expressing neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) controls anxiety through modulation of the stria terminalis, a process that is mediated by an increase in dynorphin signaling in the CeA. Our results reveal circuit and cellular dysfunctions that may account for maladaptive anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Critical Neurodevelopmental Role for L-Type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels in Neurite Extension and Radial Migration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5551?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5551?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite many association studies linking gene polymorphisms and mutations of L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGCCs) in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the roles of specific L-type VGCC during brain development remain unclear. Calcium signaling has been shown to be essential for neurodevelopmental processes such as sculpting of neurites, functional wiring, and fine tuning of growing networks. To investigate this relationship, we performed submembraneous calcium imaging using a membrane-tethered genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) Lck-G-CaMP7. We successfully recorded &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;pontaneous regenerative calcium transients (SRCaTs) in developing mouse excitatory cortical neurons prepared from both sexes before synapse formation. SRCaTs originated locally in immature neurites independently of somatic calcium rises and were significantly more elevated in the axons than in dendrites. SRCaTs were not blocked by tetrodoxin, a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker, but were strongly inhibited by hyperpolarization, suggesting a voltage-dependent source. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations revealed the critical importance of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 (CACNA1C) pore-forming subunit of L-type VGCCs, which were indeed expressed in immature mouse brains. Consistently, knocking out Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 resulted in significant alterations of neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, expression of a gain-of-function Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 mutant found in Timothy syndrome, an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder exhibiting syndromic autism, resulted in impaired radial migration of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons, whereas postnatal abrogation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 enhancement could rescue cortical malformation. Together, these lines of evidence suggest a critical role for spontaneous opening of L-type VGCCs in neural development and corticogenesis and indicate that L-type VGCCs might constitute a perinatal therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric calciochannelopathies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite many association studies linking gene polymorphisms and mutations of L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGCCs) in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the roles of specific L-type VGCCs during brain development remain unclear. We here combined the latest Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicator technology, quantitative pharmacology, and &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation and found a hitherto unsuspected role for L-type VGCCs in determining the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling landscape of mouse immature neurons. We found that malfunctional L-type VGCCs in immature neurons before birth might cause errors in neuritic growth and cortical migration. Interestingly, the retarded corticogenesis phenotype was rescued by postnatal correction of L-type VGCC signal aberration. These findings suggest that L-type VGCCs might constitute a perinatal therapeutic target for neurodevelopment-associated psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Somatotopic Representation of Second Pain in the Primary Somatosensory Cortex of Humans and Rodents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5538?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5538?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is now compelling evidence that selective stimulation of A nociceptors eliciting first pain evokes robust responses in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In contrast, whether the C-fiber nociceptive input eliciting second pain has an organized projection to S1 remains an open question. Here, we recorded the electrocortical responses elicited by nociceptive-specific laser stimulation of the four limbs in 202 humans (both males and females, using EEG) and 12 freely moving rats (all males, using ECoG). Topographical analysis and source modeling revealed in both species, a clear gross somatotopy of the unmyelinated C-fiber input within the S1 contralateral to the stimulated side. In the human EEG, S1 activity could be isolated as an early-latency negative deflection (C-N1 wave peaking at 710–730 ms) after hand stimulation, but not after foot stimulation because of the spatiotemporal overlap with the subsequent large-amplitude supramodal vertex waves (C-N2/P2). In contrast, because of the across-species difference in the representation of the body surface within S1, S1 activity could be isolated in rat ECoG as a C-N1 after both forepaw and hindpaw stimulation. Finally, we observed a functional dissociation between the generators of the somatosensory-specific lateralized waves (C-N1) and those of the supramodal vertex waves (C-N2/P2), indicating that C-fiber unmyelinated input is processed in functionally distinct somatosensory and multimodal cortical areas. These findings demonstrated that C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of noxious stimulation across the body surface, a prerequisite for deploying an appropriate defensive motor repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Unmyelinated C-fibers are the evolutionarily oldest peripheral afferents responding to noxious environmental stimuli. Whether C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of the noxious stimulation to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) remains an open issue. In this study, C-fibers were activated by radiant heat stimuli delivered to different parts of the body in both humans and rodents while electrical brain activity was recorded. In both species, the C-fiber peripheral input projects to different parts of the contralateral S1, coherently with the representation of the body surface within this brain region. These findings demonstrate that C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of noxious stimulation across the body surface, a prerequisite for deploying an appropriate defensive motor repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppression of AMPA Receptor Exocytosis Contributes to Hippocampal LTD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5523?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5523?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The decrease in number of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) at excitatory synapses causes LTD, a cellular basis of learning and memory. The number of postsynaptic AMPARs is regulated by the balance of exocytosis and endocytosis, and enhanced endocytosis of AMPAR has been suggested to underlie the LTD expression. However, it remains unclear how endocytosis and exocytosis of AMPAR change during LTD. In this study, we addressed this question by analyzing exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPAR by imaging super-ecliptic pHlorin (SEP)-tagged AMPAR around postsynaptic structure formed directly on the glass surface in the hippocampal culture prepared from rat embryos of both sexes. Contrary to a prevailing view on the LTD expression by endocytosis enhancement, the LTD induction by NMDA application only transiently enhanced endocytosis of SEP-tagged GluA1 subunits of AMPAR, which was counteracted by simultaneous augmentation of exocytosis. As a result, soon after the start of the LTD induction (~1 min), the surface AMPAR did not markedly decrease. Thereafter, the surface GluA1-SEP gradually decreased (2–5 min) and kept at a low level until the end of observation (&amp;gt;30 min). Surprisingly, this gradual and sustained decrease of surface AMPAR was accompanied not by the enhanced endocytic events of GluA1, but by the suppression of exocytosis. Together, our data highlight an unprecedented mechanism for the LTD expression by attenuation of exocytosis of AMPAR, but not by enhanced endocytosis, together with a reduction of postsynaptic AMPAR scaffolding protein PSD95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been generally assumed that LTD is expressed by enhancement of AMPAR endocytosis. Previous studies reported that endocytosis-related protein was involved in LTD and that significant amount of cell-surface AMPAR moved into intracellular compartments during LTD. Here, we report changes of cell-surface amount of AMPAR, and where and when individual exocytosis and endocytosis occurred during LTD. Cell-surface AMPAR gradually decreased in synchrony with suppression of exocytosis but not with enhancement of endocytosis. These results suggest that the decrease of cell-surface AMPAR amount during LTD was caused not by enhancement of endocytosis but rather by suppression of exocytosis, which revises current understanding of the expression mechanism of LTD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identification of a Rhythmic Firing Pattern in the Enteric Nervous System That Generates Rhythmic Electrical Activity in Smooth Muscle</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5507?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The enteric nervous system (ENS) contains millions of neurons essential for organization of motor behavior of the intestine. It is well established that the large intestine requires ENS activity to drive propulsive motor behaviors. However, the firing pattern of the ENS underlying propagating neurogenic contractions of the large intestine remains unknown. To identify this, we used high-resolution neuronal imaging with electrophysiology from neighboring smooth muscle. Myoelectric activity underlying propagating neurogenic contractions along murine large intestine [also referred to as colonic migrating motor complexes, (CMMCs)] consisted of prolonged bursts of rhythmic depolarizations at a frequency of ~2 Hz. Temporal coordination of this activity in the smooth muscle over large spatial fields (~7 mm, longitudinally) was dependent on the ENS. During quiescent periods between neurogenic contractions, recordings from large populations of enteric neurons, in mice of either sex, revealed ongoing activity. The onset of neurogenic contractions was characterized by the emergence of temporally synchronized activity across large populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This neuronal firing pattern was rhythmic and temporally synchronized across large numbers of ganglia at ~2 Hz. ENS activation preceded smooth muscle depolarization, indicating rhythmic depolarizations in smooth muscle were controlled by firing of enteric neurons. The cyclical emergence of temporally coordinated firing of large populations of enteric neurons represents a unique neural motor pattern outside the CNS. This is the first direct observation of rhythmic firing in the ENS underlying rhythmic electrical depolarizations in smooth muscle. The pattern of neuronal activity we identified underlies the generation of CMMCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How the enteric nervous system (ENS) generates neurogenic contractions of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been a long-standing mystery in vertebrates. It is well known that myogenic pacemaker cells exist in the GI tract [called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)] that generate rhythmic myogenic contractions. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of rhythmic neurogenic contractions of smooth muscle in the GI tract remains unknown. We developed a high-resolution neuronal imaging method with electrophysiology to address this issue. This technique revealed a novel pattern of rhythmic coordinated neuronal firing in the ENS that has never been identified. Rhythmic neuronal firing in the ENS was found to generate rhythmic neurogenic depolarizations in smooth muscle that underlie contraction of the GI tract.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Frequency Response of Outer Hair Cell Voltage-Dependent Motility Is Limited by Kinetics of Prestin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5495?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The voltage-dependent protein SLC26a5 (prestin) underlies outer hair cell electromotility (eM), which is responsible for cochlear amplification in mammals. The electrical signature of eM is a bell-shaped nonlinear capacitance (NLC), deriving from prestin sensor-charge (Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) movements, which peaks at the membrane voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, where charge is distributed equally on either side of the membrane. Voltage dependencies of NLC and eM differ depending on interrogation frequency and intracellular chloride, revealing slow intermediate conformational transitions between anion binding and voltage-driven Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; movements. Consequently, NLC exhibits low-pass characteristics, substantially below prevailing estimates of eM frequency response. Here we study in guinea pig and mouse of either sex synchronous prestin electrical (NLC, Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and mechanical (eM) activity across frequencies under voltage clamp (whole cell and microchamber). We find that eM and Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; magnitude and phase correspond, indicating tight piezoelectric coupling. Electromechanical measures (both NLC and eM) show dual-Lorentzian, low-pass behavior, with a limiting (&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) time constant at V&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; of 32.6 and 24.8 μs, respectively. As expected for voltage-dependent kinetics, voltage excitation away from V&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; has a faster, flatter frequency response, with our fastest measured &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for eM of 18.2 μs. Previous observations of ultrafast eM (  2 μs) were obtained at offsets far removed from V&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. We hypothesize that trade-offs in eM gain-bandwith arising from voltage excitation at membrane potentials offset from V&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; influence the effectiveness of cochlear amplification across frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Of two types of hair cells within the organ of Corti, inner hair cells and outer hair cells, the latter evolved to boost sensitivity to sounds. Damage results in hearing loss of 40–60 dB, revealing amplification gains of 100–1000&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; that arise from voltage-dependent mechanical responses [electromotility (eM)]. eM, driven by the membrane protein prestin, may work beyond 70 kHz. However, this speed exceeds, by over an order of magnitude, kinetics of typical voltage-dependent membrane proteins. We find eM is actually low pass in nature, indicating that prestin bears kinetics typical of other membrane proteins. These observations highlight potential difficulties in providing sufficient amplification beyond a cutoff frequency near 20 kHz. Nevertheless, observed trade-offs in eM gain-bandwith may sustain cochlear amplification across frequency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: miR126-5p Downregulation Facilitates Axon Degeneration and NMJ Disruption via a Non-Cell-Autonomous Mechanism in ALS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5478?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axon degeneration and disruption of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are key events in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology. Although the disease's etiology is not fully understood, it is thought to involve a non–cell-autonomous mechanism and alterations in RNA metabolism. Here, we identified reduced levels of miR126-5p in presymptomatic ALS male mice models, and an increase in its targets: axon destabilizing Type 3 Semaphorins and their coreceptor Neuropilins. Using compartmentalized &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cocultures, we demonstrated that myocytes expressing diverse ALS-causing mutations promote axon degeneration and NMJ dysfunction, which were inhibited by applying Neuropilin1 blocking antibody. Finally, overexpressing miR126-5p is sufficient to transiently rescue axon degeneration and NMJ disruption both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying ALS pathology, in which alterations in miR126-5p facilitate a non–cell-autonomous mechanism of motor neuron degeneration in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite some progress, currently no effective treatment is available for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We suggest a novel regulatory role for miR126-5p in ALS and demonstrate, for the first time, a mechanism by which alterations in miR126-5p contribute to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption observed in ALS. We show that miR126-5p is altered in ALS models and that it can modulate Sema3 and NRP protein expression. Furthermore, NRP1 elevations in motor neurons and muscle secretion of Sema3A contribute to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption in ALS. Finally, overexpressing miR126-5p is sufficient to transiently rescue NMJ disruption and axon degeneration both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Signatures of the Processing of Temporal Patterns in Sound</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5466?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to detect regularities in sound (i.e., recurring structure) is critical for effective perception, enabling, for example, change detection and prediction. Two seemingly unconnected lines of research concern the neural operations involved in processing regularities: one investigates how neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularities (e.g., frequency modulation; FM) in sounds, whereas the other focuses on increases in sustained activity during stimulation with repeating tone-frequency patterns. In three electroencephalography studies with male and female human participants, we investigated whether neural synchronization and sustained neural activity are dissociable, or whether they are functionally interdependent. Experiment I demonstrated that neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularity (FM) in sounds, and that sustained activity increases concomitantly. In Experiment II, phase coherence of FM in sounds was parametrically varied. Although neural synchronization was more sensitive to changes in FM coherence, such changes led to a systematic modulation of both neural synchronization and sustained activity, with magnitude increasing as coherence increased. In Experiment III, participants either performed a duration categorization task on the sounds, or a visual object tracking task to distract attention. Neural synchronization was observed regardless of task, whereas the sustained response was observed only when attention was on the auditory task, not under (visual) distraction. The results suggest that neural synchronization and sustained activity levels are functionally linked: both are sensitive to regularities in sounds. However, neural synchronization might reflect a more sensory-driven response to regularity, compared with sustained activity which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Optimal perception requires that the auditory system detects regularities in sounds. Synchronized neural activity and increases in sustained neural activity both appear to index the detection of a regularity, but the functional interrelation of these two neural signatures is unknown. In three electroencephalography experiments, we measured both signatures concomitantly while listeners were presented with sounds containing frequency modulations that differed in their regularity. We observed that both neural signatures are sensitive to temporal regularity in sounds, although they functionally decouple when a listener is distracted by a demanding visual task. Our data suggest that neural synchronization reflects a more automatic response to regularity compared with sustained activity, which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Statistics of Natural Communication Signals Observed in the Wild Identify Important Yet Neglected Stimulus Regimes in Weakly Electric Fish</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems evolve in the ecological niches that each species is occupying. Accordingly, encoding of natural stimuli by sensory neurons is expected to be adapted to the statistics of these stimuli. For a direct quantification of sensory scenes, we tracked natural communication behavior of male and female weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus rostratus&lt;/i&gt;, in their Neotropical rainforest habitat with high spatiotemporal resolution over several days. In the context of courtship, we observed large quantities of electrocommunication signals. Echo responses, acknowledgment signals, and their synchronizing role in spawning demonstrated the behavioral relevance of these signals. In both courtship and aggressive contexts, we observed robust behavioral responses in stimulus regimes that have so far been neglected in electrophysiological studies of this well characterized sensory system and that are well beyond the range of known best frequency and amplitude tuning of the electroreceptor afferents' firing rate modulation. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying sensory scenes derived from freely behaving animals in their natural habitats for understanding the function and evolution of neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The processing mechanisms of sensory systems have evolved in the context of the natural lives of organisms. To understand the functioning of sensory systems therefore requires probing them in the stimulus regimes in which they evolved. We took advantage of the continuously generated electric fields of weakly electric fish to explore electrosensory stimulus statistics in their natural Neotropical habitat. Unexpectedly, many of the electrocommunication signals recorded during courtship, spawning, and aggression had much smaller amplitudes or higher frequencies than stimuli used so far in neurophysiological characterizations of the electrosensory system. Our results demonstrate that quantifying sensory scenes derived from freely behaving animals in their natural habitats is essential to avoid biases in the choice of stimuli used to probe brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neocortical pyramidal neurons with somata in layers 5 and 6 are among the most visually striking and enigmatic neurons in the brain. These deep-layer pyramidal neurons (DLPNs) integrate a plethora of cortical and extracortical synaptic inputs along their impressive dendritic arbors. The pattern of cortical output to both local and long-distance targets is sculpted by the unique physiological properties of specific DLPN subpopulations. Here we revisit two broad DLPN subpopulations: those that send their axons within the telencephalon (intratelencephalic neurons) and those that project to additional target areas outside the telencephalon (extratelencephalic neurons). While neuroscientists across many subdisciplines have characterized the intrinsic and synaptic physiological properties of DLPN subpopulations, our increasing ability to selectively target and manipulate these output neuron subtypes advances our understanding of their distinct functional contributions. This Viewpoints article summarizes our current knowledge about DLPNs and highlights recent work elucidating the functional differences between DLPN subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Human Motor Thalamus Reconstructed in 3D from Continuous Sagittal Sections with Identified Subcortical Afferent Territories</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Classification and delineation of the motor-related nuclei in the human thalamus have been the focus of numerous discussions for a long time. Difficulties in finding consensus have for the most part been caused by paucity of direct experimental data on connections of individual nuclear entities. Kultas-Ilinsky et al. (2011, J Comp Neurol, 519:2811-2837) showed that distribution of the isoform 65 of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the enzyme that synthesizes inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a reliable marker that allows to delineate connectionally distinct nuclei in the human motor thalamus, namely the territories innervated by nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents. We compared those immunocytochemical staining patterns with underlying cytoarchitecture and used the latter to outline the three afferent territories in a continuous series of sagittal Nissl-stained sections of the human thalamus. The 3D volume reconstructed from the outlines was placed in the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system relative to the intercommissural line and sectioned in three stereotactic planes to produce color-coded nuclear maps. This 3D coordinate-based atlas was co-registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. The current report proposes a simplified nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic nuclei, presents images of selected histological sections and stereotactic maps illustrating topographic relationships of these nuclei as well as their relationship with adjacent somatosensory afferent region. The data are useful in different applications such as functional MRI and diffusion tractography. The three-dimensional dataset is publicly available under an open license and can also be applicable in clinical interventions in the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This is the first demonstration of revised maps of human motor thalamic nuclei that clearly identify subterritories based on their afferents in three stereotactic planes derived from a continuous series of histologic sections from a single brain. Consistent inter-slice distance and high resolution ensure a high reliability of target coordinates because the dataset is applicable in all planes. Nuclear outlines based on a specific marker and straightforward modified nomenclature reflect the functional and connectional properties of motor-related regions. 3D coordinate-based atlas space is co-registered with the most modern version of the widely used MNI space (multispectral MNI-152 2009b NLIN Asym template). The report introduces a unique tool for researchers and clinicians studying the human thalamus with experimental and imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Simultaneous Ablation of Neuronal Neurofascin and Ankyrin G in Young and Adult Mice Reveals Age-Dependent Increase in Nodal Stability in Myelinated Axons and Differential Effects on the Lifespan</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Nodes of Ranvier are unique regions where voltage-gated sodium channels are highly enriched to drive saltatory conduction. Genetic ablations in adult mice with loss of specific nodal proteins causes slow but progressive nodal deterioration associated with decreased nerve conduction and axonopathy. What has remained unaddressed is whether loss of nodal proteins at different time points in postnatal life follows similar timelines of nodal disorganization. Here we utilized simultaneous ablation of Neurofascin (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG) in mice of both sexes at three specific time points. We report that concurrent ablation of these core nodal components at postnatal day (P) 13 leads to accelerated nodal destabilization than at P23, and this disorganization is even slower when ablated at P93. Ablation of NF186 with AnkG at P13 reduced the half-life of NF186 to 15 days compared to 1 month at P23 which increased to 2 months at P93, indicating increasing nodal stability. The half-life of AnkG at the nodes also increased with age but showed enhanced disappearance from the node in the absence of NF186 with a half-life of 3 days at P13 ablation. The nodal disorganization occurred in a sequential manner with AnkG disappearing first from the nodal areas irrespective of the timing of ablation and led to decreased nerve conduction and affected axonal health. Together, our studies reveal that nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons continue to become more stable with age and suggest that nodal disorganization in adult human demyelinating disorders occurs slowly until neurological symptoms become evident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The initial clustering, maturation, and life-long maintenance of nodes of Ranvier along myelinated axons are vital to the saltatory propagation of action potentials, allowing for rapid movements. to investigate if the kinetics for nodal destabilization are variable with age, we have used a novel mouse model where two essential nodal proteins, Neurofascin 186 (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG), were simultaneous ablated from neurons at different time points. Our studies show that nodal stability after maturation is not only dependent on the synergistic functions of these core nodal components but also that nodes become more stable as animals age, which is relevant to human demyelination disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We observe and study a self-organized phenomenon whereby the activity in a
network of spiking neurons spontaneously terminates. We consider different
types of populations, consisting of bistable model neurons connected
electrically by gap junctions, or by either excitatory or inhibitory synapses,
in a scale-free connection topology. We find that strongly synchronized
population spiking events lead to complete cessation of activity in excitatory
networks, but not in gap-junction or inhibitory networks. We identify the
underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon by examining the
particular shape of the excitatory post-synaptic currents that arise in the
neurons. We also examine the effects of the synaptic time constant, coupling
strength, and channel noise on the occurrence of the phenomenon.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fast Compensatory Functional Network Changes Caused by Reversible Inactivation of Monkey Parietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy128</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy128/5036733?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions. However, little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and (correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal, reversible inactivations. Specifically, monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition, these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli, we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP, especially FEF. Furthermore, in areas such as FEF and V4, muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably, the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation, suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network, with FEF a likely key player. The excitationâ€“inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PSD-95/discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knock-out (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knock-down (KD) of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala [posteromedial cortical nucleus (PmCo)] feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb. Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feedforward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells. In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Transducin {beta}-Subunit Can Interact with Multiple G-Protein {gamma}-Subunits to Enable Light Detection by Rod Photoreceptors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The heterotrimeric G-protein transducin mediates visual signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Many aspects of the function of transducin were learned from knock-out mice lacking its individual subunits. Of particular interest is the knockout of its rod-specific -subunit (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &amp;gt;60-fold reduction in the light sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-subunit partner. One study found that the light sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; activation is supported by remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; associating with other G subunits naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light sensitivity loss but a much lower, only approximately sixfold, reduction of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and proposed that the light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knock-out rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side by side. We first determined that the outer segments of both mice have identical Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild-type (WT) level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is present in a complex with endogenous G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits and that these complexes exist in wild-type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; alone supports light responses of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knock-out rods and suggest that Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evidence accumulation in a Laplace domain decision space. (arXiv:1806.04122v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence accumulation models of simple decision-making have long assumed that
the brain estimates a scalar decision variable corresponding to the
log-likelihood ratio of the two alternatives. Typical neural implementations of
this algorithmic cognitive model assume that large numbers of neurons are each
noisy exemplars of the scalar decision variable. Here we propose a neural
implementation of the diffusion model in which many neurons construct and
maintain the Laplace transform of the distance to each of the decision bounds.
As in classic findings from brain regions including LIP, the firing rate of
neurons coding for the Laplace transform of net accumulated evidence grows to a
bound during random dot motion tasks. However, rather than noisy exemplars of a
single mean value, this approach makes the novel prediction that firing rates
grow to the bound exponentially, across neurons there should be a distribution
of different rates. A second set of neurons records an approximate inversion of
the Laplace transform, these neurons directly estimate net accumulated
evidence. In analogy to time cells and place cells observed in the hippocampus
and other brain regions, the neurons in this second set have receptive fields
along a &quot;decision axis.&quot; This finding is consistent with recent findings from
rodent recordings. This theoretical approach places simple evidence
accumulation models in the same mathematical language as recent proposals for
representing time and space in cognitive models for memory.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes and implements an intuitive and pervasive solution for
neonatal EEG monitoring assisted by sonification and deep learning AI that
provides information about neonatal brain health to all neonatal healthcare
professionals, particularly those without EEG interpretation expertise. The
system aims to increase the demographic of clinicians capable of diagnosing
abnormalities in neonatal EEG. The proposed system uses a low-cost and
low-power EEG acquisition system. An Android app provides single-channel EEG
visualization, traffic-light indication of the presence of neonatal seizures
provided by a trained, deep convolutional neural network and an algorithm for
EEG sonification, designed to facilitate the perception of changes in EEG
morphology specific to neonatal seizures. The multifaceted EEG interpretation
framework is presented and the implemented mobile platform architecture is
analyzed with respect to its power consumption and accuracy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a system operating on multiple time scales, and characterisation
of dynamics across time scales remains a challenge. One framework to study such
dynamics is that of fractal geometry. However, currently there exists no
established method for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry, due
to the many challenges in the conceptual and technical understanding of the
methods. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying
fractal geometry to brain dynamics and propose solutions to enable its wider
use in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded EEG and simulated data, we
compared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity
to signal variance. We found that both correlate closely with signal variance,
thus not offering new information about the signal. However, after applying an
epoch-wise standardisation procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal
measures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance,
power and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different
multifractal estimation methods and found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm
performed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and
epoch length on multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example
event in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale for detecting
temporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical
issues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing a
robust method for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals. Our
analyses and observations also aid the theoretical understanding of the
multifractal properties of the brain and might provide grounds for new
discoveries in the study of brain signals. These could be crucial for
understanding of neurological function and for the developments of new
treatments.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How the visual system can detect feature homogeneity from spike latencies. (arXiv:1806.03881v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03881</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03881</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose that homogeneous image regions may be used to quickly segment a
visual scene, when an object hypothesis is not yet available. In a cooperative
model of the konio-cellular and the parvo- or magno-cellular visual pathway of
primates, we demonstrate how homogeneity-selective responses can be gained from
LGN neurons using a spike-latency code, and how these responses can confine
edge detection to borders between mid-sized objects. We propose that
spike-latency-based homogeneity detection is a general neural principle that
may apply to any sensory feature and modality. The mechanism is sensitive to
exact spike timing, which makes it vulnerable to noise. Nevertheless we
demonstrate how the mechanism can be made robust against realistic levels of
neural cross talk in the brain. We show that biphasic synaptic events do yield
very sharp post synaptic currents that maintain good separation of homogeneity
responses in massively noisy environments. The same technique opens up a neural
method of tuning neurons to varying degrees of homogeneity. The simple neural
implementation, generality, robustness, and variable tuning make
homogeneity-detection an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neural
networks and in the brain.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Overlap in Item Representations Across Episodes Impairs Context Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We frequently encounter the same item in different contexts, and when that happens, memories of earlier encounters can get reactivated. We examined how existing memories are changed as a result of such reactivation. We hypothesized that when an item’s initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. Specifically, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to subsequent source memory. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. In contrast, greater reactivation of the initial context was associated with better source memory. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., item) is represented across these episodes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Relationships Between Neuronal Oscillatory Amplitude and Dynamic Functional Connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain “activity”. However, the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular, whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics, integration between regions, or both, is unknown. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further, in resting-state data, we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled, or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here, we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that, in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability, the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations, and suggest that time–frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal D1 Dopamine-Receptor Neurons and Delta Resonance in Interval Timing</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity—monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibit time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1–4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early versus late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Molecular networks are at the core of most cellular decisions, but are often difficult to comprehend. Reverse engineering of network architecture from their functions has proved fruitful to classify and predict the structure and function of molecular networks, suggesting new experimental tests and biological predictions. We present &lt;i&gt;φ&lt;/i&gt;-evo, an open-source program to evolve &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; phenotypic networks performing a given biological function. We include implementations for evolution of biochemical adaptation, adaptive sorting for immune recognition, metazoan development (somitogenesis, hox patterning), as well as Pareto evolution. We detail the program architecture based on C, Python 3, and a Jupyter interface for project configuration and network analysis. We illustrate the predictive power of &lt;i&gt;φ&lt;/i&gt;-evo by first recovering the asymmetrical structure of the &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon regulation from an objective function with symmetrical constraints. Second, we use the problem of hox-like embryonic patterning to show how a single effective fitness can emerge from multi-objective (Pareto) evolution. &lt;i&gt;φ&lt;/i&gt;-evo provides an efficient approach and user-friendly interface for the phenotypic prediction of networks and the numerical study of evolution itself.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8XzRpNVsmSQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The effect of cell geometry on polarization in budding yeast</title>

The localization (or polarization) of proteins on the membrane during the mating of budding yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) is an important model system for understanding simple pattern formation within cells. While there are many existing mathematical models of polarization, for both budding and mating, there are still many aspects of this process that are not well understood. In this paper we set out to elucidate the effect that the geometry of the cell can have on the dynamics of certain models of polarization. Specifically, we look at several spatial stochastic models of Cdc42 polarization that have been adapted from published models, on a variety of tip-shaped geometries, to replicate the shape change that occurs during the growth of the mating projection. We show here that there is a complex interplay between the dynamics of polarization and the shape of the cell. Our results show that while models of polarization can generate a stable polarization cap, its localization at the tip of mating projections is unstable, with the polarization cap drifting away from the tip of the projection in a geometry dependent manner. We also compare predictions from our computational results to experiments that observe cells with projections of varying lengths, and track the stability of the polarization cap. Lastly, we examine one model of actin polarization and show that it is unlikely, at least for the models studied here, that actin dynamics and vesicle traffic are able to overcome this effect of geometry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HB-3yftCf6M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanical positioning of multiple nuclei in muscle cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Angelika Manhart, Stefanie Windner, Mary Baylies, Alex Mogilner&lt;/p&gt;

Many types of large cells have multiple nuclei. In skeletal muscle fibers, the nuclei are distributed along the cell to maximize their internuclear distances. This myonuclear positioning is crucial for cell function. Although microtubules, microtubule associated proteins, and motors have been implicated, mechanisms responsible for myonuclear positioning remain unclear. We used a combination of rough interacting particle and detailed agent-based modeling to examine computationally the hypothesis that a force balance generated by microtubules positions the muscle nuclei. Rather than assuming the nature and identity of the forces, we simulated various types of forces between the pairs of nuclei and between the nuclei and cell boundary to position the myonuclei according to the laws of mechanics. We started with a large number of potential interacting particle models and computationally screened these models for their ability to fit biological data on nuclear positions in hundreds of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval muscle cells. This reverse engineering approach resulted in a small number of feasible models, the one with the best fit suggests that the nuclei repel each other and the cell boundary with forces that decrease with distance. The model makes nontrivial predictions about the increased nuclear density near the cell poles, the zigzag patterns of the nuclear positions in wider cells, and about correlations between the cell width and elongated nuclear shapes, all of which we confirm by image analysis of the biological data. We support the predictions of the interacting particle model with simulations of an agent-based mechanical model. Taken together, our data suggest that microtubules growing from nuclear envelopes push on the neighboring nuclei and the cell boundaries, which is sufficient to establish the nearly-uniform nuclear spreading observed in muscle fibers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nOcrMsLp00k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Changes in parasite traits, rather than intensity, affect the dynamics of infection under external perturbation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Suma Ghosh, Matthew J. Ferrari, Ashutosh K. Pathak, Isabella M. Cattadori&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the mechanisms that generate complex host-parasite interactions, and how they contribute to variation between and within hosts, is important for predicting risk of infection and transmission, and for developing more effective interventions based on parasite properties. We used the &lt;i&gt;T. retortaeformis&lt;/i&gt; (TR)-rabbit system and developed a state-space mathematical framework to capture the variation in intensity of infection and egg shedding in hosts infected weekly, then treated with an anthelminthic and subsequently re-challenged following the same infection regime. Experimental infections indicate that parasite intensity accumulates more slowly in the post-anthelminthic phase but reaches similar maximum numbers. By contrast, parasite EPG (eggs per gram of feces) shed from rabbits in the post-treatment phase is lower and less variable through time. Inference based on EPG alone suggests a decline in parasite intensity over time. Using a state-space model and incorporating all sources of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we show that while parasite intensity remains relatively constant in both experimental phases, shedding of eggs into the environment is increasingly limited through changes in parasite growth. We suggest that host immunity directly modulates both the accumulation and the growth of the parasite, and indirectly affects transmission by limiting parasite length and thus fecundity. This study provides a better understanding of how within-host trophic interactions influence different components of a helminth population. It also suggests that heterogeneity in parasite traits should be addressed more carefully when examining and managing helminth infections in the absence of some critical data on parasite dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aq6_Ne53vz8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Ethanol Regulates Presynaptic Activity and Sedation through Presynaptic Unc13 Proteins in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0125-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it is not yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol (DAG) binding. The inhibition of DAG binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt;, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of &lt;i&gt;Munc13-1&lt;/i&gt; in heterozygotes for a &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between &lt;i&gt;Munc13-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Development of Parvalbumin-Expressing Basket Terminals in Layer II of the Rat Medial Entorhinal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC LII) generate multiple regular firing fields in response to the position and speed of an individual within the environment. They exhibit a protracted postnatal development and, in the adult, show activity differences along the dorsoventral axis (DVA). Evidence suggests parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, most of which are perisomatic-targeting cells, play a crucial role in generation of the hexagonal grid cell activity pattern. We therefore hypothesized that the development and organization of PV+ perisomatic terminals in MEC LII reflects the postnatal emergence of the hexagonal firing pattern and dorsoventral differences seen in grid cell activity. We used immuno-electron microscopy to examine the development of PV+ perisomatic terminals and their target somata within dorsal and ventral MEC LII in rats of postnatal days (P)10, 15 and 30. We demonstrate that in dorsal and ventral MEC LII, the cross-sectional area of somata and number and density of perisomatic PV+ terminals increase between P10 and P15. A simultaneous decrease was observed in cross-sectional area of PV+ terminals. Between P15 and P30, both MEC regions showed an increase in PV+ terminal size and percentage of PV+ terminals containing mitochondria, which may enable grid cell activity to emerge and stabilize. We also report that dorsal somata are larger and apposed by more PV+ terminals than ventral somata at all stages, suggesting a protracted maturation in the ventral portion and a possible gradient in soma size and PV+ basket innervation along the DVA in the adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Grid cells within layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex produce a regular firing pattern in response to the environment during exploration. This pattern emerges after eye-opening in rodents and exhibits a gradient along the dorsoventral axis. Input from parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons is crucial for maintaining the grid pattern; however, how the PV+ innervation develops is unclear. Here we examine the structural development of dorsal and ventral perisomatic PV+ terminals and target somata. We show that the size of grid-related somata and number of PV+ terminals increase before eye-opening whereas PV+ terminals increase in size during grid activity stabilization. We further demonstrate that maturation in the ventral part is delayed, and that there are dorsoventral differences in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only FDA-approved drug for ischemic stroke. However, tPA has to be administered within 4.5 h from the disease onset and delayed treatment of tPA can increase the risk of neurovascular impairment, including neuronal cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hemorrhagic transformation. A key contributing factor for tPA-induced neurovascular impairment is activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). We used a clinically-relevant mouse embolic model of focal-cerebral ischemia by insertion of a single embolus of blood clot to block the right middle cerebral artery. We showed that administration of the potent and highly selective gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT extends the time window for administration of tPA, attenuating infarct volume, mitigating BBB disruption, and antagonizing the increase in cerebral hemorrhage induced by tPA treatment. We demonstrated that SB-3CT attenuates tPA-induced expression of vascular MMP-9, prevents gelatinase-mediated cleavage of extracellular laminin, rescues endothelial cells, and reduces caveolae-mediated transcytosis of endothelial cells. These results suggest that abrogation of MMP-9 activity mitigates the detrimental effects of tPA treatment, thus the combination treatment holds great promise for extending the therapeutic window for tPA thrombolysis, which opens the opportunity for clinical recourse to a greater number of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Endovascular thrombectomy benefited patients with disproportionately severe clinical deficit relative to infarct volume and provides a surgical option for treatment of ischemic stroke. Tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved clot-dissolving drug for treatment of ischemic stroke. However, its beneficial effect is seen only within 4.5 hours from the onset of stroke, with better outcomes observed the sooner treatment is given. Major risk is MMP-9–mediated neurovascular impairment. We document that early administration of the pharmacological agent SB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CT reduces MMP-9 levels and mitigates the side effects associated with tPA. Furthermore, it extends the time window for treatment with tPA after stroke holding great potential for both disease intervention and benefiting patients who might not otherwise be candidates for treatment with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neural Correlates of Odor Learning in the Presynaptic Microglomerular Circuitry in the Honeybee Mushroom Body Calyx</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The mushroom body (MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory, though exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in the boutons and conditioned behavioral responses to learned odors in honeybees. We found that the absolute amount of the neural change for the rewarded but not for the unrewarded odor was correlated with the behavioral learning rate across individuals. The temporal profile of the induced changes matched with odor response dynamics of the MB-associated inhibitory neurons, suggestive of activity modulation of boutons by this neural class. We hypothesize the circuit-specific neural plasticity relates to the learned value of the stimulus and underlies the conditioned behavior of the bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In order to understand memory processing in the brain, it is important to identify the synaptic locations and activities where memory information is stored. This requires monitoring neuronal activity in behaving animals, a technically very demanding task especially in tiny insects. Here we succeeded to measure neuronal activity from restrained yet behaving honeybees. We recorded the activity of olfactory projection neurons from the mushroom body, an insect brain center for learning and memory, while bees are performing an olfactory reward learning task. We found that the amount of neural plasticity correlates with the quantitative expression of a learned behavior to the sugar rewarded odor. Our results contribute to the understanding of the physiologic basis of memory formation in an insect brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Changes in Noise Correlations Contribute to an Enhanced Representation of Saccadic Targets in Prefrontal Neuronal Ensembles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy141</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy141/5035458?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstarct&lt;/div&gt;An ensemble of neurons can provide a dynamic representation of external stimuli, ongoing processes, or upcoming actions. This dynamic representation could be achieved by changes in the activity of individual neurons and/or their interactions. To investigate these possibilities, we simultaneously recorded from ensembles of prefrontal neurons in non-human primates during a memory-guided saccade task. Using both decoding and encoding methods, we examined changes in the information content of individual neurons and that of ensembles between visual encoding and saccadic target selection. We found that individual neurons maintained their limited spatial sensitivity between these cognitive states, whereas the ensemble selectively improved its encoding of spatial locations far from the neurons’ preferred locations. This population-level “encoding expansion” was not due to the ceiling effect at the preferred locations and was accompanied by selective changes in noise correlations for non-preferred locations. Moreover, the encoding expansion was observed for ensembles of different types of neurons and could not be explained by shifts in the preferred location of individual neurons. Our results demonstrate that the representation of space by neuronal ensembles is dynamically enhanced prior to saccades, and this enhancement occurs alongside changes in noise correlations more than changes in the activity of individual neurons.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Letter and Category Fluency Performance Correlates with Distinct Patterns of Cortical Thickness in Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Verbal fluency tasks are generally thought to be mediated by frontal brain regions for letter fluency and temporal regions for category fluency. This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging. The evidence for the anatomical substrates of letter and category fluency, each recruiting slightly different language and cognitive processes, can serve both clinical applications as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the organization of the cerebral cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: To Move or Not to Move? Functional Role of Ventral Premotor Cortex in Motor Monitoring During Limb Immobilization</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy134/5035448?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex (PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed, PMC lesions prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended, but not executed, movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared, in healthy subjects, free movements against blocked movements, precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization, when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements, the contralateral right (ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex, suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially, after 1 week of immobilization, when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and, therefore, predictions about motor consequences were changed, vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization, as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Anticipating epidemic transitions with imperfect data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006204</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias S. Brett, Eamon B. O’Dea, Éric Marty, Paige B. Miller, Andrew W. Park, John M. Drake, Pejman Rohani&lt;/p&gt;

Epidemic transitions are an important feature of infectious disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, with are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IrC-01N73dA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reciprocal Negative Regulation Between Lmx1a and Lmo4 Is Required for Inner Ear Formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/23/5429?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;LIM-domain containing transcription factors (LIM-TFs) are conserved factors important for embryogenesis. The specificity of these factors in transcriptional regulation is conferred by the complexes that they form with other proteins such as LIM-domain-binding (Ldb) proteins and LIM-domain only (LMO) proteins. Unlike LIM-TFs, these proteins do not bind DNA directly. LMO proteins are negative regulators of LIM-TFs and function by competing with LIM-TFs for binding to Ldb's. Although the LIM-TF Lmx1a is expressed in the developing mouse hindbrain, which provides many of the extrinsic signals for inner ear formation, conditional knock-out embryos of both sexes show that the inner ear source of Lmx1a is the major contributor of ear patterning. In addition, we have found that the reciprocal interaction between Lmx1a and Lmo4 (a LMO protein within the inner ear) mediates the formation of both vestibular and auditory structures. Lmo4 negatively regulates Lmx1a to form the three sensory cristae, the anterior semicircular canal, and the shape of the utricle in the vestibule. Furthermore, this negative regulation blocks ectopic sensory formation in the cochlea. In contrast, Lmx1a negatively regulates Lmo4 in mediating epithelial resorption of the canal pouch, which gives rise to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals. We also found that Lmx1a is independently required for the formation of the endolymphatic duct and hair cells in the basal cochlear region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mammalian inner ear is a structurally complex organ responsible for detecting sound and maintaining balance. Failure to form the intricate 3D structure of this organ properly during development most likely will result in sensory deficits on some level. Here, we provide genetic evidence that a transcription factor, Lmx1a, interacts with its negative regulator, Lmo4, to pattern various vestibular and auditory components of the mammalian inner ear. Identifying these key molecules that mediate formation of this important sensory organ will be helpful for designing strategies and therapeutics to alleviate hearing loss and balance disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulation of BDNF Release by ARMS/Kidins220 through Modulation of Synaptotagmin-IV Levels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/23/5415?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;BDNF is a growth factor with important roles in the nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions, but the mechanisms controlling its secretion are not completely understood. Here, we show that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion in neurons from the CNS and PNS. Downregulation of the ARMS/Kidins220 protein in the adult mouse brain increases regulated BDNF secretion, leading to its accumulation in the striatum. Interestingly, two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) showed increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and regulated BDNF secretion deficits. Importantly, reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 in hippocampal slices from HD mice reversed the impaired regulated BDNF release. Moreover, there are increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and PFC of patients with HD. ARMS/Kidins220 regulates Synaptotagmin-IV levels, which has been previously observed to modulate BDNF secretion. These data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 controls the regulated secretion of BDNF and might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; BDNF is an important growth factor that plays a fundamental role in the correct functioning of the CNS. The secretion of BDNF must be properly controlled to exert its functions, but the proteins regulating its release are not completely known. Using neuronal cultures and a new conditional mouse to modulate ARMS/Kidins220 protein, we report that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion. Moreover, ARMS/Kidins220 is overexpressed in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD), causing an impaired regulation of BDNF secretion. Furthermore, ARMS/Kidins220 levels are increased in brain samples from HD patients. Future studies should address whether ARMS/Kidins220 has any function on the pathophysiology of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Sigma Increases Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Degradation through Cathepsin B Secretion to Enhance Axon Outgrowth</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/23/5399?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Severed axon tips reform growth cones following spinal cord injury that fail to regenerate, in part, because they become embedded within an inhibitory extracellular matrix. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are the major axon inhibitory matrix component that is increased within the lesion scar and in perineuronal nets around deafferented neurons. We have recently developed a novel peptide modulator (intracellular sigma peptide) of the cognate receptor of CSPGs, protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP), which has been shown to markedly improve sensorimotor function, micturition, and coordinated locomotor behavior in spinal cord contused rats. However, the mechanism(s) underlying how modulation of RPTP mediates axon outgrowth through inhibitory CSPGs remain unclear. Here, we describe how intracellular sigma peptide modulation of RPTP induces enhanced protease Cathepsin B activity. Using DRG neurons from female Sprague Dawley rats cultured on an aggrecan/laminin spot assay and a combination of biochemical techniques, we provide evidence suggesting that modulation of RPTP regulates secretion of proteases that, in turn, relieves CSPG inhibition through its digestion to allow axon migration though proteoglycan barriers. Understanding the mechanisms underlying RPTP modulation elucidates how axon regeneration is impaired by proteoglycans but can then be facilitated following injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Following spinal cord injury, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) upregulate and potently inhibit axon regeneration and functional recovery. Protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP) has been identified as a critical cognate receptor of CSPGs. We have previously characterized a synthetic peptide (intracellular sigma peptide) that targets the regulatory intracellular domain of the receptor to allow axons to regenerate despite the presence of CSPGs. Here, we have found that one important mechanism by which peptide modulation of the receptor enhances axon outgrowth is through secretion of a protease, Cathepsin B, which enables digestion of CSPGs. This work links protease secretion to the CSPG receptor RPTP for the first time with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neural regeneration and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Contributions of Glutamatergic Hippocampal→Retrosplenial Cortical Projections to the Formation and Persistence of Context Memories</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Learning to associate stressful events with specific environmental contexts depends on excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, but how this information is transmitted to the neocortex for lasting memory storage is unclear. We identified dorsal hippocampal (DH) projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), which arise mainly from the subiculum and contain either the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) or vGlut2. Both vGlut1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; axons strongly excite and disynaptically inhibit RSC pyramidal neurons in superficial layers, but vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; axons trigger greater inhibition that spreads to deep layers, indicating that these pathways engage RSC circuits via partially redundant, partially differentiated cellular mechanisms. Using contextual fear conditioning in mice to model contextual associative memories, together with chemogenetic axonal silencing, we found that vGlut1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; projections are principally involved in processing recent context memories whereas vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; projections contribute to their long-lasting storage. Thus, within the DH→RSC pathway, engagement of vGlut1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; circuits differentially contribute to the formation and persistence of fear-inducing context memories.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Immature neurons generated by the subpallial MGE tangentially migrate to the cortex where they become parvalbumin-expressing (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and somatostatin (SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) interneurons. Here, we show that the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sp9&lt;/span&gt; transcription factor controls the development of MGE-derived cortical interneurons. SP9 is expressed in the MGE subventricular zone and in MGE-derived migrating interneurons. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sp9&lt;/span&gt; null and conditional mutant mice have approximately 50% reduction of MGE-derived cortical interneurons, an ectopic aggregation of MGE-derived neurons in the embryonic ventral telencephalon, and an increased ratio of SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cortical interneurons. RNA-Seq and SP9 ChIP-Seq reveal that SP9 regulates MGE-derived cortical interneuron development through controlling the expression of key transcription factors &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Arx, Lhx6, Lhx8, Nkx2-1&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Zeb2&lt;/span&gt; involved in interneuron development, as well as genes implicated in regulating interneuron migration &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ackr3, Epha3&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;St18. Thus, Sp9&lt;/span&gt; has a central transcriptional role in MGE-derived cortical interneuron development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Temporal Embryonic Origin Critically Determines Cellular Physiology in the Dentate Gyrus</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dentate gyrus, the entry gate to the hippocampus, comprises 3 types of glutamatergic cells, the granule, the mossy and the semilunar granule cells. Whereas accumulating evidence indicates that specification of subclasses of neocortical neurons starts at the time of their final mitotic divisions, when cellular diversity is specified in the Dentate Gyrus remains largely unknown. Here we show that semilunar cells, like mossy cells, originate from the earliest stages of developmental neurogenesis and that early born neurons form age-matched circuits with each other. Besides morphology, adult semilunar cells display characteristic electrophysiological features that differ from most neurons but are shared among early born granule cells. Therefore, an early birthdate specifies adult granule cell physiology and connectivity whereas additional factors may combine to produce morphological identity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Ventral Anterior Temporal Lobe has a Necessary Role in Exception Word Reading</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy131</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy131/5033553?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;An influential account of reading holds that words with exceptional spelling-to-sound correspondences (e.g., PINT) are read via activation of their lexical-semantic representations, supported by the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). This account has been inconclusive because it is based on neuropsychological evidence, in which lesion-deficit relationships are difficult to localize precisely, and functional neuroimaging data, which is spatially precise but cannot demonstrate whether the ATL activity is necessary for exception word reading. To address these issues, we used a technique with good spatial specificity—repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)—to demonstrate a necessary role of ATL in exception word reading. Following rTMS to left ventral ATL, healthy Japanese adults made more regularization errors in reading Japanese exception words. We successfully simulated these results in a computational model in which exception word reading was underpinned by semantic activations. The ATL is critically and selectively involved in reading exception words.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spatial Topography of Individual-Specific Cortical Networks Predicts Human Cognition, Personality, and Emotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy123</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy123/5033556?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the opportunity to delineate individual-specific brain networks. A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 min) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by 2 state-of-the-art methods using 5 sessions (50 min). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality, and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;strength&lt;/span&gt;, individual-specific network &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;topography&lt;/span&gt; might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Emergent Functional Network Effects in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy121</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy121/5033557?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hallmark pathology underlying Parkinson disease (PD) is progressive synucleinopathy, beginning in caudal brainstem that later spreads rostrally. However, the primarily subcortical pathology fails to account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in PD. To reconcile these observations, resting-state functional dysfunction across connectivity (FC) can be used to examine dysfunction across distributed brain networks. We measured FC in a large, single-site study of nondemented PD (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 107; OFF medications) and healthy controls (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 46) incorporating rigorous quality control measures and comprehensive sampling of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions. We employed novel statistical approaches to determine group differences across the entire connectome, at the network-level, and for select brain regions. Group differences respected well-characterized network delineations producing a striking “block-wise” pattern of network-to-network effects. Surprisingly, these results demonstrate that the greatest FC differences involve sensorimotor, thalamic, and cerebellar networks, with notably smaller striatal effects. Split-half replication demonstrates the robustness of these results. Finally, block-wise FC correlations with behavior suggest that FC disruptions may contribute to clinical manifestations in PD. Overall, these results indicate a concerted breakdown of functional network interactions, remote from primary pathophysiology, and suggest that FC deficits in PD are related to emergent network-level phenomena rather than focal pathology.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator Controlled Corticogenesis Through a Mechanism Dependent of NMDA Receptors Expressed on Radial Glial Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy119</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Modifications of neuronal migration during development, including processes that control cortical lamination are associated with functional deficits at adult stage. Here, we report for the first time that the lack of the serine protease tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA), previously characterized as a neuromodulator and a gliotransmitter, leads to an altered cortical lamination in adult. This results in a neuronal migration defect of tPA deficient neurons which are stopped in the intermediate zone at E16. This phenotype is rescued by re-expressing a wild-type tPA in cortical neurons at E14 but not by a tPA that cannot interact with NMDAR. We thus hypothetized that the tPA produced by cortical neuronal progenitors can control their own radial migration through a mechanism dependent of NMDAR expressed at the surface of radial glial cells (RGC). Accordingly, conditional deletion of tPA in neuronal progenitors at E14 or overexpression of a dominant-negative NMDAR that cannot bind tPA in RGC also delayed neuronal migration. Moreover, the lack of tPA lead to an impaired maturation and orientation of RGC. These data provide the first demonstration that the neuronal serine protease tPA is an actor of a proper corticogenesis by its ability to control NMDAR signaling in RGC.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Contrasting Semantic versus Inhibitory Processing in the Angular Gyrus: An fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy118</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy118/5033555?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent studies of semantic memory have focused on dissociating the neural bases of two foundational components of human thought: taxonomic categories, which group similar objects like dogs and seals based on features, and thematic categories, which group dissimilar objects like dogs and leashes based on events. While there is emerging consensus that taxonomic concepts are represented in the anterior temporal lobe, there is disagreement over whether thematic concepts are represented in the angular gyrus (AG). We previously found AG sensitivity to both kinds of concepts; however, some accounts suggest that such activity reflects inhibition of irrelevant information rather than thematic activation. To test these possibilities, an fMRI experiment investigated both types of conceptual relations in the AG during two semantic judgment tasks. Each task trained participants to give negative responses (inhibition) or positive responses (activation) to word pairs based on taxonomic and thematic criteria of relatedness. Results showed AG engagement during both negative judgments and thematic judgments, but not during positive judgments about taxonomic pairs. Together, the results suggest that activity in the AG reflects functions that include both thematic (but not taxonomic) processing and inhibiting irrelevant semantic information.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Revealing the Dynamic Modulations That Underpin a Resilient Neural Network for Semantic Cognition: An fMRI Investigation in Patients With Anterior Temporal Lobe Resection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy116</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy116/5033554?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;One critical feature of any well-engineered system is its resilience to perturbation and minor damage. The purpose of the current study was to investigate how resilience is achieved in higher cognitive systems, which we explored through the domain of semantic cognition. Convergent evidence implicates the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) as a conceptual knowledge hub. While bilateral damage to this region produces profound semantic impairment, unilateral atrophy/resection or transient perturbation has a limited effect. Two neural mechanisms might underpin this resilience to unilateral ATL damage: 1) the undamaged ATL upregulates its activation in order to compensate; and/or 2) prefrontal regions involved in control of semantic retrieval upregulate to compensate for the impoverished semantic representations that follow from ATL damage. To test these possibilities, 34 postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 20 age-matched controls were scanned whilst completing semantic tasks. Pictorial tasks, which produced bilateral frontal and temporal activation, showed few activation differences between patients and control participants. Written word tasks, however, produced a left-lateralized activation pattern and greater differences between the groups. Patients with right ATL resection increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Patients with left ATL resection upregulated both the right ATL and right IFG. Consistent with recent computational models, these results indicate that 1) written word semantic processing in patients with ATL resection is supported by upregulation of semantic knowledge and control regions, principally in the undamaged hemisphere, and 2) pictorial semantic processing is less affected, presumably because it draws on a more bilateral network.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications, are involved in multiple aspects of neuronal function and development. Recent discoveries have shed light on critical functions of chromatin in the aging brain, with an emerging realization that the maintenance of a healthy brain relies heavily on epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we present recent advances, with a focus on histone modifications and the implications for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Evolution of Variability and Robustness in Neural Development</title>

	<description>As in all biological systems, neurons and their networks must balance precision with variability. Phenotypic precision and phenotypic variability can both occur with remarkable robustness, where robustness is defined as the ability to tolerate perturbation. Variability in genotype–phenotype mapping produces phenotypic variability despite identical genetic information. The resulting variability among genetically identical neurons can contribute to the robustness of brain development. Similarly, variability of genetically identical individuals can contribute to evolutionary robustness.</description>

	<description>In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Synaptic Capture of Laterally Diffusing AMPA Receptors – An Idea That Stuck</title>

	<description>By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.</description>

	<description>Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.</description>

	<description>In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sculpting light to reveal brain function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sculpting light to reveal brain function, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0158-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0158-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New techniques enable simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging from ensembles of tens of neurons in vivo. Improved opsins are localized to the cell body, minimizing spurious activation of the optically unresolvable neuropil. Two-photon light pulses are sculpted in space, time, and wavelength to efficiently target the desired cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/aPqMplIqk1w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
