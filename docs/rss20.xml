	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mobility can promote the evolution of cooperation via emergent self-assortment dynamics</title>

The evolution of costly cooperation, where cooperators pay a personal cost to benefit others, requires that cooperators interact more frequently with other cooperators. This condition, called positive assortment, is known to occur in spatially-structured viscous populations, where individuals typically have low mobility and limited dispersal. However many social organisms across taxa, from cells and bacteria, to birds, fish and ungulates, are mobile, and live in populations with considerable inter-group mixing. In the absence of information regarding others’ traits or conditional strategies, such mixing may inhibit assortment and limit the potential for cooperation to evolve. Here we employ spatially-explicit individual-based evolutionary simulations to incorporate costs and benefits of two coevolving costly traits: cooperative and local cohesive tendencies. We demonstrate that, despite possessing no information about others’ traits or payoffs, mobility (via self-propulsion or environmental forcing) facilitates assortment of cooperators via a dynamically evolving difference in the cohesive tendencies of cooperators and defectors. We show analytically that this assortment can also be viewed in a multilevel selection framework, where selection for cooperation among emergent groups can overcome selection against cooperators within the groups. As a result of these dynamics, we find an oscillatory pattern of cooperation and defection that maintains cooperation even in the absence of well known mechanisms such as kin interactions, reciprocity, local dispersal or conditional strategies that require information on others’ strategies or payoffs. Our results offer insights into differential adhesion based mechanisms for positive assortment and reveal the possibility of cooperative aggregations in dynamic fission-fusion populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jZzpQOEMUtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Population FBA predicts metabolic phenotypes in yeast</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005728</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Piyush Labhsetwar, Marcelo C. R. Melo, John A. Cole, Zaida Luthey-Schulten&lt;/p&gt;

Using protein counts sampled from single cell proteomics distributions to constrain fluxes through a genome-scale model of metabolism, Population flux balance analysis (Population FBA) successfully described metabolic heterogeneity in a population of independent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells growing in a defined medium. We extend the methodology to account for correlations in protein expression arising from the co-regulation of genes and apply it to study the growth of independent &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells in two different growth media. We find the partitioning of flux between fermentation and respiration predicted by our model agrees with recent &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C fluxomics experiments, and that our model largely recovers the Crabtree effect (the experimentally known bias among certain yeast species toward fermentation with the production of ethanol even in the presence of oxygen), while FBA without proteomics constraints predicts respirative metabolism almost exclusively. The comparisons to the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C study showed improvement upon inclusion of the correlations and motivated a technique to systematically identify inconsistent kinetic parameters in the literature. The minor secretion fluxes for glycerol and acetate are underestimated by our method, which indicate a need for further refinements to the metabolic model. For yeast cells grown in synthetic defined (SD) medium, the calculated broad distribution of growth rates matches experimental observations from single cell studies, and we characterize several metabolic phenotypes within our modeled populations that make use of diverse pathways. Fast growing yeast cells are predicted to perform significant amount of respiration, use serine-glycine cycle and produce ethanol in mitochondria as opposed to slow growing cells. We use a genetic algorithm to determine the proteomics constraints necessary to reproduce the growth rate distributions seen experimentally. We find that a core set of 51 constraints are essential but that additional constraints are still necessary to recover the observed growth rate distribution in SD medium.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Ch-pmMQQWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25015-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause of nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in young adults. The genesis of brain AVM remains enigmatic. We investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression and its contribution to the pathogenesis of brain AVMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25015-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a large-scale miRNA analysis of 16 samples including AVMs, hemangioblastoma, and controls to identify a distinct AVM miRNA signature. AVM smooth muscle cells (AVMSMCs) were isolated and identified by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, and candidate miRNAs were then tested in these cells. Migration, tube formation, and CCK-8–induced proliferation assays were used to test the effect of the miRNAs on phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs. A quantitative proteomics approach was used to identify protein expression changes in AVMSMCs treated with miRNA mimics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25015-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinct AVM miRNA signature comprising a large portion of lowly expressed miRNAs was identified. Among these miRNAs, miR-137 and miR-195* levels were significantly decreased in AVMs and constituent AVMSMCs. Experimentally elevating the level of these microRNAs inhibited AVMSMC migration, tube formation, and survival in vitro and the formation of vascular rings in vivo. Proteomics showed the protein expression signature of AVMSMCs and identified downstream proteins regulated by miR-137 and miR-195* that were key signaling proteins involved in vessel development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25015-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that miR-137 and miR-195* act as vasculogenic suppressors in AVMs by altering phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs, and that the absence of miR-137 and miR-195* expression leads to abnormal vasculogenesis.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Axonal components of nerves innervating the human arm</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axons traveling within the brachial plexus are responsible for the dexterous control of human arm and hand movements. Despite comprehensive knowledge on the topographical anatomy of nerves innervating the human upper limbs, the definite quantity of sensory and motor axons within this neural network remains elusive. Our aim was to perform a quantitative analysis of the axonal components of human upper limb nerves based on highly specific molecular features from spinal cord level to the terminal nerves at wrist level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve specimen harvest at predefined harvesting sites (plexus roots and cords as well as major nerves originating from the brachial plexus innervating the arm and hand) was performed in 9 human heart-beating organ donors. Double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against choline-acetyltransferase and neurofilament was performed to differentiate motor and sensory axons on nerve cross sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three hundred fifty thousand axons emerge from the spinal cord to innervate the human upper limb, of which 10% are motor neurons. In all nerves studied, sensory axons outnumber motor axons by a ratio of at least 9:1. The sensory axon contribution increases when moving distally, whereas only 1,700 motor axons reach the hand to innervate the intrinsic musculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that upper limb motor execution, and particularly dexterous coordination of hand movement, require an unexpectedly low number of motor neurons, with a large convergence of afferent input for feedback control.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain structural connectivity atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. (arXiv:1709.02369v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Analysis and quantification of brain structural changes, using Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), are increasingly used to define novel biomarkers of
brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network-based models of
the brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can
reveal patterns of disease propagation. On the other hand, intra-subject
descriptions cannot exploit the whole information context, accessible through
inter-subject comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel approach,
which models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and
summarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset
multiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC),
AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD
(cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, $0.86 \pm 0.01$ and $0.84 \pm 0.01$.
The model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling
the brain in equal volumes of $3000$ $mm^3$ (&quot;patches&quot;), without any $a$
$priori$ segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to
standard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex
network approach had higher sensitivity. This method is general and can have
twofold potential applications: providing a reliable tool for clinical trials
and a disease signature of neurodegenerative pathologies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Active Inference. (arXiv:1709.02341v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work combines the free energy principle from cognitive neuroscience and
the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational
inference on deep generative models and evolution strategies as efficient
large-scale black-box optimisation technique, to introduce the &quot;deep active
inference&quot; agent. This agent tries to minimize a variational free energy bound
on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic
argument. It does so by changing the parameters of its generative model,
together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution
over latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment
to actively sample input that is likely under its generative model. The
internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep neural networks, as
used in machine learning, and recurrent dynamics, making the deep active
inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agents.
Using the mountaincar problem, we show how goal-directed behaviour can be
implemented by defining sensible prior expectations on the latent states in the
agent's model, that it will try to fulfil. Furthermore, we show that the deep
active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The field of neuroscience is facing an unprecedented expanse in the volume
and diversity of available data. Traditionally, network models have provided
key insights into the structure and function of the brain. With the advent of
big data in neuroscience, both more sophisticated models capable of
characterizing the increasing complexity of the data and novel methods of
quantitative analysis are needed. Recently multilayer networks, a mathematical
extension of traditional networks, have gained increasing popularity in
neuroscience due to their ability to capture the full information of
multi-model, multi-scale, spatiotemporal data sets. Here, we review multilayer
networks and their applications in neuroscience, showing how incorporating the
multilayer framework into network neuroscience analysis has uncovered
previously hidden features of brain networks. We specifically highlight the use
of multilayer networks to model disease, structure-function relationships,
network evolution, and link multi-scale data. Finally, we close with a
discussion of promising new directions of multilayer network neuroscience
research and propose a modified definition of multilayer networks designed to
unite and clarify the use of the multilayer formalism in describing real-world
systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A computational hierarchy in human cortex. (arXiv:1709.02323v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchies feature prominently in anatomical accounts of cortical
organisation. An open question is which computational (algorithmic) processes
are implemented by these hierarchies. One renowned hypothesis is that cortical
hierarchies implement a model of the world's causal structure and serve to
infer environmental states from sensory inputs. This view, which casts
perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference, has become a highly influential
concept in both basic and clinical neuroscience. So far, however, a direct
correspondence between the predicted order of hierarchical Bayesian
computations and the sequence of evoked neuronal activity has not been
demonstrated. Here, we present evidence for this correspondence from
neuroimaging and electrophysiological data in healthy volunteers. Trial-wise
sequences of hierarchical computations were inferred from participants'
behaviour during a social learning task that required multi-level inference
about intentions. We found that the temporal sequence of neuronal activity
matched the order of computations as predicted by the theory. These findings
provide strong evidence for the operation of hierarchical Bayesian inference in
human cortex. Furthermore, our approach offers a novel strategy for the
combined computational-physiological phenotyping of patients with disorders of
perception, such as schizophrenia or autism.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many organisms can remember locations they have previously visited during a
search. Visual search experiments have shown exploration is guided away from
these locations, reducing the overlap of the search path before finding a
hidden target. We develop and analyze a two-layer neural field model that
encodes positional information during a search task. A position-encoding layer
sustains a bump attractor corresponding to the searching agent's current
location, and search is modeled by velocity input that propagates the bump. A
memory layer sustains persistent activity bounded by a wave front, whose edges
expand in response to excitatory input from the position layer. Search can then
be biased in response to remembered locations, influencing velocity inputs to
the position layer. Asymptotic techniques are used to reduce the dynamics of
our model to a low-dimensional system of equations that track the bump position
and front boundary. Performance is compared for different target-finding tasks.

	<description>Addressing how neural circuits underlie behavior is routinely done by measuring electrical activity from single neurons in experimental sessions. While such recordings yield snapshots of neural dynamics during specified tasks, they are ill-suited for tracking single-unit activity over longer timescales relevant for most developmental and learning processes, or for capturing neural dynamics across different behavioral states. Here we describe an automated platform for continuous long-term recordings of neural activity and behavior in freely moving rodents. An unsupervised algorithm identifies and tracks the activity of single units over weeks of recording, dramatically simplifying the analysis of large datasets. Months-long recordings from motor cortex and striatum made and analyzed with our system revealed remarkable stability in basic neuronal properties, such as firing rates and inter-spike interval distributions. Interneuronal correlations and the representation of different movements and behaviors were similarly stable. This establishes the feasibility of high-throughput long-term extracellular recordings in behaving animals.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27402</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27402</link>
	<description>We have identified the plant biflavonoid hinokiflavone as an inhibitor of splicing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and modulator of alternative splicing in cells. Chemical synthesis confirms hinokiflavone is the active molecule. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by blocking spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of the A complex. Cells treated with hinokiflavone show altered subnuclear organization specifically of splicing factors required for A complex formation, which relocalize together with SUMO1 and SUMO2 into enlarged nuclear speckles. Hinokiflavone increases protein SUMOylation levels, both in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; splicing reactions and in cells. Hinokiflavone also inhibited a purified, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; expressed SUMO protease, SENP1, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation. Using a quantitative proteomics assay we identified many SUMO2 sites whose levels increased in cells following hinokiflavone treatment, with the major targets including 6 proteins that are components of the U2 snRNP and required for A complex formation.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/26509</link>
	<description>Wnt5a-Ror signaling constitutes a developmental pathway crucial for embryonic tissue morphogenesis, reproduction and adult tissue regeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt5a-Ror pathway mediates these processes are largely unknown. Using a proteomic screen, we identify the kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b as a downstream target of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway. Wnt5a-Ror, through a process independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, regulates the cellular stability of Kif26b by inducing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Through this mechanism, Kif26b modulates the migratory behavior of cultured mesenchymal cells in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Genetic perturbation of Kif26b function in vivo caused embryonic axis malformations and depletion of primordial germ cells in the developing gonad, two phenotypes characteristic of disrupted Wnt5a-Ror signaling. These findings indicate that Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of morphogenetic cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates and reveal a new role for regulated proteolysis in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signal transduction.</description>

	<description>Phenomics, which ideally involves in-depth phenotyping at the whole-organism scale, may enhance our functional understanding of genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate methods to profile hundreds of phenotypic measures comprised of morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of sites within the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish. We show the potential for vertebral patterns to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. We identify phenotypes associated with human brittle bone disease and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor hyperactivity. Finally, we develop allometric models and show their potential to aid in the discrimination of mutant phenotypes masked by alterations in growth. Our studies demonstrate virtues of deep phenotyping in a spatially distributed organ system. Analyzing phenotypic patterns may increase productivity in genetic screens, and facilitate the study of genetic variants associated with smaller effect sizes, such as those that underlie complex diseases.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/25269</link>
	<description>Commissural axons switch on responsiveness to Wnt attraction during midline crossing to turn anteriorly after exiting the floor plate. We report here Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) downregulates Shisa2, which inhibits glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Frizzled3 in rodent commissural axon growth cones. Constitutive Shisa2 expression causes randomized turning of post-crossing commissural axons along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. Loss of Shisa2 lead to precocious anterior turning of commissural axons before or during midline crossing. Post-crossing commissural axon turning is completely randomized along the A-P axis when &lt;i&gt;Wntless&lt;/i&gt;, essential for Wnt secretion, is conditionally knocked out in the floor plate. The regulatory link between Shh and PCP signaling may also occur in other developmental processes.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Inhibition of DYRK1A disrupts neural lineage specification in human pluripotent stem cells</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/24502</link>
	<description>Genetic analysis has revealed that the dual specificity protein kinase DYRK1A has multiple roles in the development of the central nervous system. Increased &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, affects neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, we show that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of loss of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; during early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells.</description>

	<description>Meta-analyses are increasingly used for synthesis of evidence, and often include an assessment of publication bias based on detection of asymmetry in funnel plots. We studied the influence of different normalisation approaches, sample size and intervention effects on funnel plot asymmetry, using empirical datasets and illustrative simulations. We found that funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) plotted against the standard error (SE) are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication bias. Distortion was more severe when the primary studies had a small sample size and when an intervention effect was present. We show that using the Normalised Mean Difference (when possible), or plotting the SMD against a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives. We conclude that funnel plots using the SMD in combination with the SE are unsuitable for publication bias assessments and can lead to false-positive results.</description>

	<description>Tool use has allowed humans to become one of the most successful species. However, tool-assisted foraging has also pushed many of our prey species to extinction or endangerment, a technology-driven process thought to be uniquely human. Here, we demonstrate that tool-assisted foraging on shellfish by long-tailed macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt;) in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, reduces prey size and prey abundance, with more pronounced effects where the macaque population size is larger. We compared availability, sizes and maturation stages of shellfish between two adjacent islands inhabited by different-sized macaque populations and demonstrate potential effects on the prey reproductive biology. We provide evidence that once technological macaques reach a large enough group size, they enter a feedback loop – driving shellfish prey size down with attendant changes in the tool sizes used by the monkeys. If this pattern continues, prey populations could be reduced to a point where tool-assisted foraging is no longer beneficial to the macaques, which in return may lessen or extinguish the remarkable foraging technology employed by these primates.</description>

	<description>The occipital cortex of early blind individuals (EB) activates during speech processing, challenging the notion of a hard-wired neurobiology of language. But, at what stage of speech processing do occipital regions participate in EB? Here we demonstrate that parieto-occipital regions in EB enhance their synchronization to acoustic fluctuations in human speech in the theta-range (corresponding to syllabic rate), irrespective of speech intelligibility. Crucially, enhanced synchronization to the intelligibility of speech was selectively observed in primary visual cortex in EB, suggesting that this region is at the interface between speech perception and comprehension. Moreover, EB showed overall enhanced functional connectivity between temporal and occipital cortices sensitive to speech intelligibility and altered directionality when compared to the sighted group. These findings suggest that the occipital cortex of the blind adopts an architecture allowing the tracking of speech material, and therefore does not fully abstract from the reorganized sensory inputs it receives.</description>

	<description>Detailed descriptions of the development of the hippocampus promise to shed light on the neural foundation of development of memory and other cognitive functions, as well as the emergence of major mental disorders. The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with a well characterized internal complexity, but development of its distinct subregions in humans has remained poorly described. Here, we analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large longitudinal sample (270 participants, 678 scans) using a novel state-of-the-art automated segmentation tool and mixed models to delineate the development of hippocampal subregion volumes from childhood to adulthood. We also investigated whether subregion volumes and development were sexually dimorphic and related to general cognitive ability. Nonlinear developmental trajectories with early volume increases were observed for subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA) 1, molecular layer (ML) and fimbria. In contrast, parasubiculum, presubiculum, CA2/3, CA4 and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG) showed linear volume decreases. Sex differences were found for most subregion volumes, but not for their development. Finally, general cognitive ability was positively associated with CA2/3 and CA4 volumes, as well as with ML development. In conclusion, hippocampal subregions appear to develop in diversified ways across adolescence, and specific subregions link to general cognitive level.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Increased axonal bouton stability during learning in the mouse model of MECP2 duplication syndrome</title>

	<description>MECP2-duplication syndrome is an X-linked form of syndromic autism caused by genomic duplication of the region encoding Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. Mice overexpressing MECP2 demonstrate altered patterns of learning and memory, including enhanced motor learning. Previous work associated this enhanced motor learning to abnormally increased stability of dendritic spine clusters formed in the apical tuft of corticospinal, area M1, neurons during rotarod training. In the current study, we measure the structural plasticity of axonal boutons in Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 during motor learning. In wild-type mice we find that during rotarod training, bouton formation rate changes minimally, if at all, while bouton elimination rate doubles. Notably, the observed upregulation in bouton elimination with learning is absent in MECP2-duplication mice. This result provides further evidence of imbalance between structural stability and plasticity in this form of syndromic autism. Furthermore, the observation that axonal bouton elimination doubles with motor learning in wild-type animals contrasts with the increase of dendritic spine consolidation observed in corticospinal neurons at the same layer. This dissociation suggests that different area M1 microcircuits may manifest different patterns of structural synaptic plasticity during motor learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A unified framework for dissecting the effects of common signals on functional and effective connectivity analyses: power, coherence, and Granger causality</title>

	<description>When analyzing neural data it is important to consider the limitations of the particular experimental setup. An enduring issue in the context of electrophysiology is the presence of common signals. For example a non-silent reference electrode adds a common signal across all recorded data and this adversely affects functional and effective connectivity analysis. To address the common signals problem, a number of methods have been proposed, but relatively few detailed investigations have been carried out. We address this gap by analyzing local field potentials recorded from the small brains of fruit flies. We conduct our analysis following a solid mathematical framework that allows us to make precise predictions regarding the nature of the common signals. We demonstrate how a framework that jointly analyzes power, coherence and quantities from the Granger causality framework allows us to detect and assess the nature of the common signals. Our analysis revealed substantial common signals in our data, in part due to a non-silent reference electrode. We further show that subtracting spatially adjacent signals (bipolar rereferencing) largely removes the effects of the common signals. However, in some special cases this operation itself introduces a common signal. The mathematical framework and analysis pipeline we present can readily be used by others to detect and assess the nature of the common signals in their data, thereby reducing the chance of misinterpreting the results of functional and effective connectivity analysis.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Two passive mechanical conditions modulate power generation by the outer hair cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanju Liu, Sheryl M. Gracewski, Jong-Hoon Nam&lt;/p&gt;

In the mammalian cochlea, small vibrations of the sensory epithelium are amplified due to active electro-mechanical feedback of the outer hair cells. The level of amplification is greater in the base than in the apex of the cochlea. Theoretical studies have used longitudinally varying active feedback properties to reproduce the location-dependent amplification. The active feedback force has been considered to be proportional to the basilar membrane displacement or velocity. An underlying assumption was that organ of Corti mechanics are governed by rigid body kinematics. However, recent progress in vibration measurement techniques reveals that organ of Corti mechanics are too complicated to be fully represented with rigid body kinematics. In this study, two components of the active feedback are considered explicitly—organ of Corti mechanics, and outer hair cell electro-mechanics. Physiological properties for the outer hair cells were incorporated, such as the active force gain, mechano-transduction properties, and membrane RC time constant. Instead of a kinematical model, a fully deformable 3D finite element model was used. We show that the organ of Corti mechanics dictate the longitudinal trend of cochlear amplification. Specifically, our results suggest that two mechanical conditions are responsible for location-dependent cochlear amplification. First, the phase of the outer hair cell’s somatic force with respect to its elongation rate varies along the cochlear length. Second, the local stiffness of the organ of Corti complex felt by individual outer hair cells varies along the cochlear length. We describe how these two mechanical conditions result in greater amplification toward the base of the cochlea.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0NEUBF5ry7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Neurotransmitter release depends on the SNARE complex formed by syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, as well as on complexins, which bind to the SNARE complex and play active and inhibitory roles. A crystal structure of a Complexin-I fragment bearing a so-called 'superclamp' mutation bound to a truncated SNARE complex lacking the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (SNAREΔ60) suggested that an 'accessory' α-helix of Complexin-I inhibits release by inserting into the C-terminus of the SNARE complex. Previously, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments performed in different laboratories yielded apparently discrepant results in support or against the existence of such binding mode in solution (Trimbuch et al., 2014; Krishnakumar et al., 2015). Here, ITC experiments performed to solve these discrepancies now show that the region containing the Complexin-I accessory helix and preceding N-terminal sequences does interact with SNAREΔ60, but the interaction requires the polybasic juxtamembrane region of syntaxin-1 and is not affected by the superclamp mutation within the experimental error of these experiments.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dual function of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis in myelination of the peripheral nervous system</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29241</link>
	<description>Myelination is a biosynthetically demanding process in which mTORC1, the gatekeeper of anabolism, occupies a privileged regulatory position. We have shown previously that loss of mTORC1 function in Schwann cells (SCs) hampers myelination. Here, we genetically disrupted key inhibitory components upstream of mTORC1, TSC1 or PTEN, in mouse SC development, adult homeostasis, and nerve injury. Surprisingly, the resulting mTORC1 hyperactivity led to markedly delayed onset of both developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. However, if mTORC1 was hyperactivated after myelination onset, radial hypermyelination was observed. At early developmental stages, physiologically high PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling suppresses expression of Krox20 (Egr2), the master regulator of PNS myelination. This effect is mediated by S6K and contributes to control mechanisms that keep SCs in a not-fully differentiated state to ensure proper timing of myelination initiation. An ensuing decline in mTORC1 activity is crucial to allow myelination to start, while remaining mTORC1 activity drives myelin growth.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Post-translational thioamidation of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in methanogenic and methanotrophic Archaea</title>

	<description>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), found in strictly anaerobic methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea, catalyzes the reversible production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α subunit of MCR (McrA) contains several unusual post-translational modifications, including a rare thioamidation of glycine. Based on the presumed function of homologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of thioviridamide, a thioamide-containing natural product, we hypothesized that the archaeal &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; genes would be responsible for post-translational installation of thioglycine into McrA. Mass spectrometric characterization of McrA from the methanogenic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Methanosarcina acetivorans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; revealed the presence of glycine, rather than thioglycine, supporting this hypothesis. Phenotypic characterization of the ∆&lt;i&gt;ycaO-tfuA&lt;/i&gt; mutant revealed a severe growth rate defect on substrates with low free energy yields and at elevated temperatures (39°C - 45°C). Our analyses support a role for thioglycine in stabilizing the protein secondary structure near the active site.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The physical dimensions of amyloid aggregates control their infective potential as prion particles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27109</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27109</link>
	<description>Transmissible amyloid particles called prions are associated with infectious prion diseases in mammals and inherited phenotypes in yeast. All amyloid aggregates can give rise to potentially infectious seeds that accelerate their growth. Why some amyloid seeds are highly infectious prion particles while others are less infectious or even inert, is currently not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the suprastructure and dimensions of synthetic amyloid fibrils assembled from the yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) prion protein Sup35NM. We then quantified the ability of these particles to induce the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype in cells. Our results show a striking relationship between the length distribution of the amyloid fibrils and their ability to induce the heritable [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype. Using a simple particle size threshold model to describe transfection activity, we explain how dimensions of amyloid fibrils are able to modulate their infectious potential as prions.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Fundamental bound on the persistence and capacity of short-term memory stored as graded persistent activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22225</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/22225</link>
	<description>It is widely believed that persistent neural activity underlies short-term memory. Yet, as we show, temporal degradation in such networks behaves differently from human short-term memory performance. We build a more general framework where the memory is viewed as a problem of passing information through noisy channels that represent analog persistent activity networks. Rather than directly storing information, such memory networks might hold information encoded to achieve robustness against noise. We derive a fundamental lower-bound on memory recall precision, which declines with storage duration and number of stored items. We show that human performance, though inconsistent with models involving direct (uncoded) storage in persistent activity networks, can be well-fit by the theoretical bound. This finding is consistent with the view that if the brain stores information in patterns of persistent activity, it might use codes that minimize the effects of noise, motivating the search for such codes in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Origin of Slow Spontaneous Resting-State Neuronal Fluctuations in Brain Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/186098v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/186098v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Resting or baseline state low frequency (0.01-0.2 Hz) brain activity has been observed in fMRI, EEG and LFP recordings. These fluctuations were found to be correlated across brain regions, and are thought to reflect neuronal activity fluctuations between functionally connected areas of the brain. However, the origin of these infra-slow fluctuations remains unknown. Here, using a detailed computational model of the brain network, we show that spontaneous infra-slow (&amp;lt; 0.05 Hz) fluctuations could originate due to the ion concentration dynamics. The computational model implemented dynamics for intra and extracellular K+ and Na+ and intracellular Cl- ions, Na+/K+ exchange pump, and KCC2 co-transporter. In the network model representing resting awake-like brain state, we observed slow fluctuations in the extracellular K+ concentration, Na+/K+ pump activation, firing rate of neurons and local field potentials. Holding K+ concentration constant prevented generation of these fluctuations. The amplitude and peak frequency of this activity were modulated by Na+/K+ pump, AMPA/GABA synaptic currents and glial properties. Further, in a large-scale network with long-range connections based on CoCoMac connectivity data, the infra-slow fluctuations became synchronized among remote clusters similar to the resting-state networks observed in vivo. Overall, our study proposes that ion concentration dynamics mediated by neuronal and glial activity may contribute to the generation of very slow spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity that are observed as the resting-state fluctuations in fMRI and EEG recordings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Basolateral amygdala glutamatergic neurons maintain aversive emotional salience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/186072v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/186072v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic neurons serve a well-accepted role in fear conditioning and fear extinction. However, the specific learning processes related to their activity at different times during learning remain poorly understood. We addressed this using behavioral tasks isolating distinct aspects of fear learning in rats. We show that brief optogenetic inhibition of BLA glutamatergic neurons around moments of aversive reinforcement or non-reinforcement causes reductions in the salience of conditioned stimuli, rendering these stimuli less able to be learned about and less able to control fear or safety behaviours. This salience reduction was stimulus-specific, long-lasting, and specific to aversive emotional states - precisely the goals of therapeutic interventions in human anxiety disorders. Our findings identify a core learning process disrupted by brief BLA optogenetic inhibition. They show that a primary function of BLA glutamatergic neurons is to maintain the salience of conditioned stimuli. This is a necessary precursor for these stimuli to gain and maintain control over fear and safety behavior.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/186007v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/186007v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Reliable signal transmission represents a fundamental challenge for cortical systems, which display a wide range of weights of feedforward and feedback connections among heterogeneous areas. We re-examine the question of signal transmission across the cortex in network models based on recently available mesoscopic, directed- and weighted- inter-areal connectivity data of the macaque cortex. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to feed-forward propagation models, the presence of long-range excitatory feedback projections could compromise stable signal propagation. Using population rate models as well as a spiking network model, we find that effective signal propagation can be accomplished by balanced amplification across cortical areas while ensuring dynamical stability. Moreover, the activation of prefrontal cortex in our model requires the input strength to exceed a threshold, in support of the ignition model of conscious processing, demonstrating our model as an anatomically-realistic platform for investigations of the global primate cortex dynamics.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185850v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Electrical stimulation is a widely used and effective tool in systems neuroscience, neural prosthetics, and clinical neurostimulation. However, electrical artifacts evoked by stimulation significantly complicate the detection of spiking activity on nearby recording electrodes. Here, we present ERAASR: an algorithm for Estimation and Removal of Artifacts on Arrays via Sequential principal components Regression. This approach leverages the similar structure of artifact transients, but not spiking activity, across simultaneously recorded channels on the array, across pulses within a train, and across trials. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in macaque dorsal premotor cortex using acute linear multielectrode array recordings and single electrode stimulation. Large electrical artifacts appeared on all channels during stimulation. After application of ERAASR, the cleaned signals were quiescent on channels with no spontaneous spiking activity, whereas spontaneously active channels exhibited evoked spikes which closely resembled spontaneously occurring spiking waveforms. The ERAASR algorithm requires no special hardware and comprises sequential application of straightforward linear methods with intuitive parameters. Enabling simultaneous electrical stimulation and multielectrode array recording can help elucidate the causal links between neural activity and cognitive functions and enable the design and implementation of novel sensory protheses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Presurgical language fMRI: Current practices and patient outcomes in epilepsy surgical planning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185835v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185835v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The goal of this study was to document current clinical practice and report patient outcomes in presurgical language functional MRI (fMRI) for epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgical programs worldwide were surveyed as to the utility, implementation, and efficacy of language fMRI in the clinic; 82 programs responded between July 2015 and January 2016. Respondents were predominantly from the US (61%), were academic programs (85%), and predominantly evaluated adults (44%), both adults and children (40%), or children only (16%). Nearly all (96%) respondents reported using language fMRI. fMRI is used for language lateralization (100%) and for localizing (44%) language cortex to guide surgical margins. While typically considered useful, programs often reported at least one instance of disagreement with other measures (56%). When used to localize language cortex, direct brain stimulation typically confirmed fMRI findings (74%) but instances of unpredicted decline were reported by 17% of programs and unexpected preservation of function were reported by 54%. Programs reporting unexpected decline did not clearly differ from those which did not. Clinicians using fMRI to guide surgical margins typically map Broca's and Wernicke's areas but not other known language areas. Language fMRI is widely used for lateralizing language cortex in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. It is also frequently used to localize language cortex though it is not yet well validated for this purpose. Many centers report cases of unexpected language preservation when fMRI activation is resected, and cases of language decline when it is not. Care will almost certainly be improved by standardizing protocols and accurately detailing the relationship between fMRI-positive areas and post-surgical language decline.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sparse interaction between oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2+ cells) and nodes of Ranvier in the central nervous system</title>

	<description>Regeneration of propagating action potentials at nodes of Ranvier allows nerve impulses to be conducted over long distances. Proper nodal function is believed to rely on intimate associations among axons, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and perinodal astrocytes. Studies in the optic nerve, corpus callosum, and spinal cord suggest that NG2+ cells are also key constituents of CNS nodes and that these glia may influence conduction efficacy and formation of axon collaterals. However, the prevalence of NG2+ cell processes at CNS nodes of Ranvier has not been rigorously quantified. Here we used a transgenic mouse expressing membrane-targeted EGFP to visualize the fine processes of NG2+ cells and to quantify the spatial relationship between NG2+ cells and nodes of Ranvier in four distinct CNS white matter tracts. NG2+ cell processes came within close spatial proximity to a small percentage of nodes of Ranvier and approximately half of these spatial interactions were estimated to occur by chance. The majority of NG2+ cell process tips were not found in close proximity to nodes and gray matter NG2+ cells in regions of low nodal density were as morphologically complex as their white matter counterparts, indicating that attraction to nodes does not critically influence the elaboration of NG2+ cell processes. Finally, there was no difference in nodal density between small regions devoid of NG2+ cell processes and those containing numerous NG2+ cells processes, demonstrating that the function of CNS nodes of Ranvier does not require ongoing interaction with NG2+ cells.</description>

	<description>Epilepsy affects a huge number of patients by severe disruption of brain functions and is characterised by recurrent seizures, sometimes hard to be treated by medications. Seizure induced cellular consequences in ionic gradient and homeostasis are expected to result in electrophysiological differences between epileptic and non-epileptic neurons. In the following work, we demonstrate these differences in layer III cortical pyramidal neurons sourced from epileptic and non-epileptic human patient tissue. Although visually indistinguishable and featuring similar membrane potentials and latency to first spikes upon whole cell patch stimulation, epileptic pyramidal neurons display a larger rheobase and a smaller membrane resistance, responding less efficiently to electrical stimulation than their peri-tumorous equivalents. This decreased excitability contradicts results in comparable animal models of epilepsy and was further corroborated by detailed analysis of spiking characteristics and phase plot analysis of these events. Both point to an overexpression of K+ channels trying to compensate for the hyperexcited, epileptic network state. A computational model of a pyramidal neuron was utilized to give an estimate of the needful relative changes in K+ and Na+ conductances.</description>

	<description>Memory reprocessing following acquisition enhances memory consolidation. Specifically, neural activity during encoding is thought to be replayed during subsequent slow-wave sleep (SWS). This natural tendency of memory replay can be induced by external cueing, known as targeted memory reactivation. Here, we analyzed data from a published study (van Dongen et al. 2012), where auditory cues reactivated learned visual object-location memories during SWS. Memory replay during sleep presumably involves a shift in connectivity across the brain. Therefore, we characterized the effects of memory reactivation on brain network connectivity using graph-theory. We found that cue presentation during SWS introduced dynamic changes in network integration of the occipital cortex, a visual region that was also active during the object retrieval task. Importantly, enhanced network integration of the occipital cortex showed a behavioural benefit and predicted overnight memory stabilization. Furthermore, occipital cortex displayed enhanced connectivity with mnemonic regions, namely the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex during cue versus control sound presentation. Finally, network integration of early occipital cortex during cueing in SWS was related to increased activation of the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, a region involved in coding for spatial associative information, at the post-sleep test. Together, these results support a neural mechanism where cue-induced replay during sleep promotes memory consolidation by increased integration of task-relevant perceptual regions with mnemonic regions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Task-related effective connectivity reveals that the cortical rich club gates cortex-wide communication</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185603v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Higher cognition may require the globally coordinated integration of specialized brain regions into functional networks. A collection of cortical hubs - referred to as the rich club - has been hypothesized to support task-specific functional integration. In the present paper, we use a whole-cortex model to estimate directed interactions between 68 cortical regions from fMRI activity for four different tasks (reflecting different cognitive domains) and resting state. We analyze the state-dependent input and output effective connectivity of the rich club and relate these to whole-cortex dynamics and network reconfigurations. We find that the cortical rich club exhibits an increase in outgoing effective connectivity during task performance as compared to rest while incoming connectivity remains constant. Increased outgoing connectivity targets a sparse set of peripheral regions with specific regions strongly overlapping between tasks. At the same time, community detection analyses reveal massive reorganizations of interactions among peripheral regions, including those serving as target of increased rich cub output. This suggests that while peripheral regions can play a role in several tasks, their interplay might nonetheless be task-specific. Furthermore, we observe that whole-cortex dynamics are faster during task as compared to rest. The decoupling effects usually accompanying faster dynamics appear to be counteracted by the increased rich club outgoing effective connectivity. Together our findings speak to a gating mechanism of the rich club that supports fast-paced information exchange among relevant peripheral regions in a task-specific and goal-directed fashion, while constantly listening to the whole network.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Administration of orexin A in the posterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus promotes cocaine-seeking behavior and is associated with hypothalamic activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185538v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Hypothalamic orexin (Orx) neurons that project to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) have received growing interest because of their role in drug-seeking behavior. When injected in the posterior PVT (pPVT), OrxA reinstated extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in rats that had long access (LgA) to cocaine for 6 h/day after an intermediate period of abstinence (I-Abst, 2-3 weeks). Considering the long-lasting nature of drug-seeking behavior and that the PVT sends projections to the hypothalamus, the present study examined whether (i) OrxA prime effect is preserved after a period of protracted abstinence (P-Abst, 4-5 weeks) in LgA rats and (ii) the neural activation pattern (i.e., Fos+ and Fos+/Orx+ cells) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and perifornical area (PFA) following intrapPVT OrxA administration that may explain OrxA-induced reinstatement in LgA animals. As reported previously, OrxA administration in the pPVT triggered cocaine-seeking behavior after I-Abst. With P-Abst, the priming effect of OrxA was absent. An intra-pPVT injection of OrxA produced a strong increase in neuronal activation (i.e., Fos expression) in the LH/DMH/PFA at I-Abst but not at P-Abst. The analysis of the activation (Fos+) of Orx neurons (Orx+) revealed an increase in Fos+/Orx+ expression in the LH/DMH/PFA at I-Abst only, thus paralleling the behavioral data. These data indicate that shortly after abstinence, PVT-LH/DMH/PFA connections are strongly recruited in animals with a history of cocaine dependence. The lack of effect at P-Abst suggests that the function of Orx receptors and connectivity of the PVT-LH/DMH/PFA circuit undergo significant neuroadaptations following P-Abst.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynorphin counteracts orexin in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus: cellular and behavioral evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185520v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185520v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The orexin (Orx) system is known to play a critical role in drug addiction and reward related behaviors. The dynorphin (Dyn) system, conversely, promotes depressive-like behavior and plays a key role in the aversive effects of stress. Orexin and Dyn are coreleased and have opposing functions in reward and motivation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Earlier studies showed that microinjections of OrxA in the posterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (pPVT) exerted priming-like effects and reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior, suggesting that Orx transmission in the pPVT participates in cocaine-seeking behavior. The present study sought to determine whether Orx and Dyn interact in the pPVT. Using a cellular approach, brain slices were prepared for whole-cell recordings and to study excitatory transmission in pPVT neurons. The superfusion of OrxA increased spontaneous glutamatergic transmission by increasing glutamate release onto pPVT neurons, whereas DynA decreased glutamate release. Furthermore, the augmentation of OrxA-induced glutamate release was reversed by DynA. To corroborate the electrophysiological data, separate groups of male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer cocaine or sweetened condensed milk (SCM). After self-administration training, the rats underwent extinction training and were tested with intra-pPVT administration of OrxA and/or DynA under extinction conditions. OrxA reinstated cocaine- and SCM-seeking behavior, with a greater effect in cocaine animals. DynA selectively blocked OrxA-induced cocaine seeking vs. SCM seeking. The data indicate that DynA in the pPVT prevents OrxA-induced cocaine seeking, perhaps by reversing the OrxA-induced increase in glutamate release, identifying a novel therapeutic target to prevent cocaine relapse.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Impact of In-Scanner Head Motion on Structural Connectivity Derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185397v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185397v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Multiple studies have shown that data quality is a critical confound in the construction of brain networks derived from functional MRI. This problem is particularly relevant for studies of human brain development where important variables (such as participant age) are correlated with data quality. Nevertheless, the impact of head motion on estimates of structural connectivity derived from diffusion tractography methods remains poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated the impact of in-scanner head motion on structural connectivity using a sample of 949 participants (ages 8-23 years old) who passed a rigorous quality assessment protocol for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Structural brain networks were constructed for each participant using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography. We hypothesized that subtle variation in head motion would systematically bias estimates of structural connectivity and confound developmental inference, as observed in previous studies of functional connectivity. Even following quality assurance and retrospective correction for head motion, eddy currents, and field distortions, in-scanner head motion significantly impacted the strength of structural connectivity in a consistency- and length-dependent manner. Specifically, increased head motion was associated with reduced estimates of structural connectivity for high-consistency network edges, which included both short- and long-range connections. In contrast, motion inflated estimates of structural connectivity for low-consistency network edges that were primarily shorter-range. Finally, we demonstrate that age-related differences in head motion can both inflate and obscure developmental inferences on structural connectivity. Taken together, these data delineate the systematic impact of head motion on structural connectivity, and provide a critical context for identifying motion-related confounds in studies of structural brain network development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic patterns of cortical expansion during folding of the preterm human brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185389v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185389v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>During the third trimester of human brain development, the cerebral cortex undergoes dramatic surface expansion and folding. Physical models suggest that relatively rapid growth of the cortical gray matter helps drive this folding, and structural data suggests that growth may vary in both space (by region on the cortical surface) and time. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate local growth from sequential cortical reconstructions. Using anatomically-constrained Multimodal Surface Matching (aMSM), we obtain accurate, physically-guided point correspondence between younger and older cortical reconstructions of the same individual. From each pair of surfaces, we calculate continuous, smooth maps of cortical expansion with unprecedented precision. By considering 30 preterm infants scanned 2-4 times during the period of rapid cortical expansion (28 to 38 weeks postmenstrual age), we observe significant regional differences in growth across the cortical surface that are consistent with patterns of active folding. Furthermore, these growth patterns shift over the course of development, with non-injured subjects following a highly consistent trajectory. This information provides a detailed picture of dynamic changes in cortical growth, connecting what is known about patterns of development at the microscopic (cellular) and macroscopic (folding) scales. Since our method provides specific growth maps for individual brains, we are also able to detect alterations due to injury. This fully-automated surface analysis, based on tools freely available to the brain mapping community, may also serve as a useful approach for future studies of abnormal growth due to genetic disorders, injury, or other environmental variables.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cueing memory during sleep is optimal during slow-oscillatory up-states</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185264v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Slow oscillations play a major role in neural plasticity. It is assumed that slow oscillatory up-states represent crucial time windows for memory reactivation and consolidation during sleep. Here we experimentally tested this assumption by utilizing closed-loop targeted memory reactivation (closed-loop TMR): Healthy participants were re-exposed to prior learned foreign vocabulary during up- and down-states of slow oscillations, respectively, in a within-subject design. We show that presenting memory cues during slow oscillatory up-states robustly improves recall performance, whereas memory cueing during down-states did not result in a clear behavioral benefit. On a neural basis successful memory reactivation during up-states was associated with a characteristic power increase in the theta and sleep spindle band. Such increases were completely absent for down-state memory cues. Our findings provide experimental support for the assumption that slow oscillatory up-states represent privileged time windows for memory reactivation, while the interplay of slow oscillations, theta and sleep spindle activity promote successful memory consolidation during sleep.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Alpha oscillations control cortical gain by modulating excitatory-inhibitory background activity.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185074v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185074v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The first recordings of human brain activity in 1929 revealed a striking 8-12 Hz oscillation in the visual cortex. During the intervening 90 years, these alpha oscillations have been linked to numerous physiological and cognitive processes. However, because of the vast, and seemingly contradictory, cognitive and physiological processes to which it has been related, the physiological function of alpha remains unclear. It is often suggested that alpha serves as a generic gain control process. We suggest a novel neural circuit mechanism by which alpha can act -- the modulation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in a balanced configuration. We find that this model naturally unifies the prior, highly diverse reports on alpha dynamics, while making the novel prediction that alpha rhythms have two functional roles: a sustained high-power mode that suppresses cortical gain and a weak, bursting mode that enhances gain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Temporal dissociation of salience and prediction error responses to appetitive and aversive taste</title>

	<description>The feedback-related negativity, a frontocentral event-related potential (ERP) occurring 200-350 milliseconds (ms) after emotionally-valued outcomes, has been posited as the neural correlate of reward prediction error, a key component of associative learning. Recent evidence challenged this interpretation and has led to the suggestion that this ERP expresses salience, instead. Here we distinguish between utility prediction error and salience by delivering or withholding hedonistically matched appetitive and aversive tastes, and measure ERPs to cues signalling each taste. We observed a typical FRN (computed as the loss-minus-gain difference wave) to appetitive taste, but a reverse-FRN to aversive taste. When tested axiomatically, frontocentral ERPs showed a salience response across tastes, with a particularly early response to outcome delivery, supporting recent propositions of a fast, unsigned and unspecific response to salient stimuli. ERPs also expressed aversive prediction error peaking at 285ms, which conformed to the logic of an axiomatic model of prediction error. With stimuli that most resemble those used in animal models we did not detect any frontocentral ERP signal for utility prediction error, in contrast with dominant views of the functional role of the feedback-related negativity ERP. We link the animal and human literature and present a challenge for current perspectives on associative learning research using ERPs.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bidirectional Modulation of Intrinsic Excitability in Rat Prelimbic Cortex Neuronal Ensembles and Non-Ensembles after Operant Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learned associations between environmental stimuli and rewards drive goal-directed learning and motivated behavior. These memories are thought to be encoded by alterations within specific patterns of sparsely distributed neurons called neuronal ensembles that are activated selectively by reward-predictive stimuli. Here, we use the Fos promoter to identify strongly activated neuronal ensembles in rat prelimbic cortex (PLC) and assess altered intrinsic excitability after 10 d of operant food self-administration training (1 h/d). First, we used the Daun02 inactivation procedure in male FosLacZ-transgenic rats to ablate selectively Fos-expressing PLC neurons that were active during operant food self-administration. Selective ablation of these neurons decreased food seeking. We then used male FosGFP-transgenic rats to assess selective alterations of intrinsic excitability in Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles (FosGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that were activated during food self-administration and compared these with alterations in less activated non-ensemble neurons (FosGFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;). Using whole-cell recordings of layer V pyramidal neurons in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; brain slice preparation, we found that operant self-administration increased excitability of FosGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and decreased excitability of FosGFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Increased excitability of FosGFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons was driven by increased steady-state input resistance. Decreased excitability of FosGFP&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons was driven by increased contribution of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. Injections of the specific SK channel antagonist apamin into PLC increased Fos expression but had no effect on food seeking. Overall, operant learning increased intrinsic excitability of PLC Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles that play a role in food seeking but decreased intrinsic excitability of Fos&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; non-ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prefrontal cortex activity plays a critical role in operant learning, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are unknown. Using the chemogenetic Daun02 inactivation procedure, we found that a small number of strongly activated Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles in rat PLC play an important role in learned operant food seeking. Using GFP expression to identify Fos-expressing layer V pyramidal neurons in prelimbic cortex (PLC) of FosGFP-transgenic rats, we found that operant food self-administration led to increased intrinsic excitability in the behaviorally relevant Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles, but decreased intrinsic excitability in Fos&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons using distinct cellular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calpain-Dependent Degradation of Nucleoporins Contributes to Motor Neuron Death in a Mouse Model of Chronic Excitotoxicity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8830?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity induces neuronal death by altering various intracellular signaling pathways and is implicated as a common pathogenic pathway in many neurodegenerative diseases. In the case of motor neuron disease, there is significant evidence to suggest that the overactivation of AMPA receptors due to deficiencies in the expression and function of glial glutamate transporters GLT1 and GLAST plays an important role in the mechanisms of neuronal death. However, a causal role for glial glutamate transporter dysfunction in motor neuron death remains unknown. Here, we developed a new animal model of excitotoxicity by conditionally deleting astroglial glutamate transporters GLT1 and GLAST in the spinal cords of mice (GLAST&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/GLT1-cKO). GLAST&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/GLT1-cKO mice (both sexes) exhibited nuclear irregularity and calpain-mediated degradation of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which are responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport. These abnormalities were associated with progressive motor neuron loss, severe paralysis, and shortened lifespan. The nuclear export inhibitor KPT-350 slowed but did not prevent motor neuron death, whereas long-term treatment of the AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel and the calpain inhibitor SNJ-1945 had more persistent beneficial effects. Thus, NPC degradation contributes to AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxic motor neuronal death, and preventing NPC degradation has robust protective effects. Normalization of NPC function could be a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders in which AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity is a contributory factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite glial glutamate transporter dysfunction leading to excitotoxicity has been documented in many neurological diseases, it remains unclear whether its dysfunction is a primary cause or secondary outcome of neuronal death at disease state. Here we show the combined loss of glial glutamate transporters GLT1 and GLAST in spinal cord caused motor neuronal death and hindlimb paralysis. Further, our novel mutant exhibits the nuclear irregularities and calpain-mediated progressive nuclear pore complex degradation. Our study reveals that glial glutamate transporter dysfunction is sufficient to cause motor neuronal death &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GABAergic Interneuron Differentiation in the Basal Forebrain Is Mediated through Direct Regulation of Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Isoforms by Dlx Homeobox Transcription Factors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8816?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8816?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABA is the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex but regulation of its synthesis during forebrain development is poorly understood. In the telencephalon, members of the distal-less (&lt;i&gt;Dlx&lt;/i&gt;) homeobox gene family are expressed in, and regulate the development of, the basal ganglia primodia from which many GABAergic neurons originate and migrate to other forebrain regions. The &lt;i&gt;Dlx1/Dlx2&lt;/i&gt; double knock-out mice die at birth with abnormal cortical development, including loss of tangential migration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons to the neocortex (Anderson et al., 1997a). We have discovered that specific promoter regulatory elements of glutamic acid decarboxylase isoforms (&lt;i&gt;Gad&lt;/i&gt;1 and &lt;i&gt;Gad&lt;/i&gt;2), which regulate GABA synthesis from the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, are direct transcriptional targets of both DLX1 and DLX2 homeoproteins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Further gain- and loss-of-function studies &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated that both DLX1 and DLX2 are necessary and sufficient for &lt;i&gt;Gad&lt;/i&gt; gene expression. DLX1 and/or DLX2 activated the transcription of both &lt;i&gt;Gad&lt;/i&gt; genes, and defects in &lt;i&gt;Dlx&lt;/i&gt; function disrupted the differentiation of GABAergic interneurons with global reduction in GABA levels in the forebrains of the &lt;i&gt;Dlx1/Dlx2&lt;/i&gt; double knock-out mouse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Identification of &lt;i&gt;Gad&lt;/i&gt; genes as direct &lt;i&gt;Dlx&lt;/i&gt; transcriptional targets is significant; it extends our understanding of &lt;i&gt;Dlx&lt;/i&gt; gene function in the developing forebrain beyond the regulation of tangential interneuron migration to the differentiation of GABAergic interneurons arising from the basal telencephalon, and may help to unravel the pathogenesis of several developmental brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. We show that &lt;i&gt;Dlx1/Dlx2&lt;/i&gt; homeobox genes regulate GABA synthesis during forebrain development through direct activation of glutamic acid decarboxylase enzyme isoforms that convert glutamate to GABA. This discovery helps explain how &lt;i&gt;Dlx&lt;/i&gt; mutations result in abnormal forebrain development, due to defective differentiation, in addition to the loss of tangential migration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons to the neocortex. Reduced numbers or function of cortical GABAergic neurons may lead to hyperactivity states such as seizures (Cobos et al., 2005) or contribute to the pathogenesis of some autism spectrum disorders. GABAergic dysfunction in the basal ganglia could disrupt the learning and development of complex motor and cognitive behaviors (Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Munc18-1/UNC-18 is believed to prime SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, yet the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we examine how potential gain-of-function mutations of Munc18-1/UNC-18 affect locomotory behavior and synaptic transmission, and how Munc18-1-mediated priming is related to Munc13-1/UNC-13 and Tomosyn/TOM-1, positive and negative SNARE regulators, respectively. We show that a Munc18-1(P335A)/UNC-18(P334A) mutation leads to significantly increased locomotory activity and acetylcholine release in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, as well as enhanced synaptic neurotransmission in cultured mammalian neurons. Importantly, similar to &lt;i&gt;tom-1&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, &lt;i&gt;unc-18&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;P334A&lt;/i&gt;) mutants partially bypass the requirement of UNC-13. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;unc-18&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;P334A&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;tom-1&lt;/i&gt; null mutations confer a strong synergy in suppressing the phenotypes of &lt;i&gt;unc-13&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Through biochemical experiments, we demonstrate that Munc18-1(P335A) exhibits enhanced activity in SNARE complex formation as well as in binding to the preformed SNARE complex, and partially bypasses the Munc13-1 requirement in liposome fusion assays. Our results indicate that Munc18-1/UNC-18 primes vesicle fusion downstream of Munc13-1/UNC-13 by templating SNARE complex assembly and acts antagonistically with Tomosyn/TOM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At presynaptic sites, SNARE-mediated membrane fusion is tightly regulated by several key proteins including Munc18/UNC-18, Munc13/UNC-13, and Tomosyn/TOM-1. However, how these proteins interact with each other to achieve the precise regulation of neurotransmitter release remains largely unclear. Using &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; as an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; model, we found that a gain-of-function mutant of UNC-18 increases locomotory activity and synaptic acetylcholine release, that it partially bypasses the requirement of UNC-13 for release, and that this bypass is synergistically augmented by the lack of TOM-1. We also elucidated the biochemical basis for the gain-of-function caused by this mutation. Thus, our study provides novel mechanistic insights into how Munc18/UNC-18 primes synaptic vesicle release and how this protein interacts functionally with Munc13/UNC-13 and Tomosyn/TOM-1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Audiovisual Modulation in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex Depends on Cross-Modal Stimulus Configuration and Congruency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8783?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sensory neocortex is a highly connected associative network that integrates information from multiple senses, even at the level of the primary sensory areas. Although a growing body of empirical evidence supports this view, the neural mechanisms of cross-modal integration in primary sensory areas, such as the primary visual cortex (V1), are still largely unknown. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice, we show that the encoding of audiovisual stimuli in V1 neuronal populations is highly dependent on the features of the stimulus constituents. When the visual and auditory stimulus features were modulated at the same rate (i.e., temporally congruent), neurons responded with either an enhancement or suppression compared with unisensory visual stimuli, and their prevalence was balanced. Temporally incongruent tones or white-noise bursts included in audiovisual stimulus pairs resulted in predominant response suppression across the neuronal population. Visual contrast did not influence multisensory processing when the audiovisual stimulus pairs were congruent; however, when white-noise bursts were used, neurons generally showed response suppression when the visual stimulus contrast was high whereas this effect was absent when the visual contrast was low. Furthermore, a small fraction of V1 neurons, predominantly those located near the lateral border of V1, responded to sound alone. These results show that V1 is involved in the encoding of cross-modal interactions in a more versatile way than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neural substrate of cross-modal integration is not limited to specialized cortical association areas but extends to primary sensory areas. Using two-photon imaging of large groups of neurons, we show that multisensory modulation of V1 populations is strongly determined by the individual and shared features of cross-modal stimulus constituents, such as contrast, frequency, congruency, and temporal structure. Congruent audiovisual stimulation resulted in a balanced pattern of response enhancement and suppression compared with unisensory visual stimuli, whereas incongruent or dissimilar stimuli at full contrast gave rise to a population dominated by response-suppressing neurons. Our results indicate that V1 dynamically integrates nonvisual sources of information while still attributing most of its resources to coding visual information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Goal-Directed Visual Processing Differentially Impacts Human Ventral and Dorsal Visual Representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8767?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8767?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have challenged the ventral/&quot;what&quot; and dorsal/&quot;where&quot; two-visual-processing-pathway view by showing the existence of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; information in both pathways. Is the two-pathway distinction still valid? Here, we examined how goal-directed visual information processing may differentially impact visual representations in these two pathways. Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, in three experiments on human participants (57% females), by manipulating whether color or shape was task-relevant and how they were conjoined, we examined shape-based object category decoding in occipitotemporal and parietal regions. We found that object category representations in all the regions examined were influenced by whether or not object shape was task-relevant. This task effect, however, tended to decrease as task-relevant and irrelevant features were more integrated, reflecting the well-known object-based feature encoding. Interestingly, task relevance played a relatively minor role in driving the representational structures of early visual and ventral object regions. They were driven predominantly by variations in object shapes. In contrast, the effect of task was much greater in dorsal than ventral regions, with object category and task relevance both contributing significantly to the representational structures of the dorsal regions. These results showed that, whereas visual representations in the ventral pathway are more invariant and reflect &quot;what an object is,&quot; those in the dorsal pathway are more adaptive and reflect &quot;what we do with it.&quot; Thus, despite the existence of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; information in both visual processing pathways, the two pathways may still differ fundamentally in their roles in visual information representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual information is thought to be processed in two distinctive pathways: the ventral pathway that processes &quot;what&quot; an object is and the dorsal pathway that processes &quot;where&quot; it is located. This view has been challenged by recent studies revealing the existence of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; information in both pathways. Here, we found that goal-directed visual information processing differentially modulates shape-based object category representations in the two pathways. Whereas ventral representations are more invariant to the demand of the task, reflecting what an object is, dorsal representations are more adaptive, reflecting what we do with the object. Thus, despite the existence of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; information in both pathways, visual representations may still differ fundamentally in the two pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensory-Biased and Multiple-Demand Processing in Human Lateral Frontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The functionality of much of human lateral frontal cortex (LFC) has been characterized as &quot;multiple demand&quot; (MD) as these regions appear to support a broad range of cognitive tasks. In contrast to this domain-general account, recent evidence indicates that portions of LFC are consistently selective for sensory modality. Michalka et al. (2015) reported two bilateral regions that are biased for visual attention, superior precentral sulcus (sPCS) and inferior precentral sulcus (iPCS), interleaved with two bilateral regions that are biased for auditory attention, transverse gyrus intersecting precentral sulcus (tgPCS) and caudal inferior frontal sulcus (cIFS). In the present study, we use fMRI to examine both the multiple-demand and sensory-bias hypotheses within caudal portions of human LFC (both men and women participated). Using visual and auditory 2-back tasks, we replicate the finding of two bilateral visual-biased and two bilateral auditory-biased LFC regions, corresponding to sPCS and iPCS and to tgPCS and cIFS, and demonstrate high within-subject reliability of these regions over time and across tasks. In addition, we assess MD responsiveness using BOLD signal recruitment and multi-task activation indices. In both, we find that the two visual-biased regions, sPCS and iPCS, exhibit stronger MD responsiveness than do the auditory-biased LFC regions, tgPCS and cIFS; however, neither reaches the degree of MD responsiveness exhibited by dorsal anterior cingulate/presupplemental motor area or by anterior insula. These results reconcile two competing views of LFC by demonstrating the coexistence of sensory specialization and MD functionality, especially in visual-biased LFC structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lateral frontal cortex (LFC) is known to play a number of critical roles in supporting human cognition; however, the functional organization of LFC remains controversial. The &quot;multiple demand&quot; (MD) hypothesis suggests that LFC regions provide domain-general support for cognition. Recent evidence challenges the MD view by demonstrating that a preference for sensory modality, vision or audition, defines four discrete LFC regions. Here, the sensory-biased LFC results are reproduced using a new task, and MD responsiveness of these regions is tested. The two visual-biased regions exhibit MD behavior, whereas the auditory-biased regions have no more than weak MD responses. These findings help to reconcile two competing views of LFC functional organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 in the Dorsomedial Striatum Is a Novel Positive Regulator of Alcohol Consumption</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8742?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated alcohol intake leads to mesostriatal neuroadaptations, resulting in drinking escalation and addiction phenotypes. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) has been shown to interact with the mesostriatal dopaminergic system, and has been implicated in the actions of psychostimulants in the brain, and in several psychiatric disorders. Here, we report on a positive regulatory feedback loop of alcohol and FGF2 in rodent models. Specifically, we found that acute alcohol exposure (2.5 g/kg, i.p.) increased the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Fgf2&lt;/i&gt; in the dorsal hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum. Longer alcohol exposure (7 d &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 2.5 g/kg, i.p.) restricted these increases to the dorsal striatum, and the latter effect was blocked by the dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist haloperidol. Voluntary prolonged and excessive alcohol consumption in a 2-bottle choice procedure increased &lt;i&gt;Fgf2&lt;/i&gt; expression selectively in dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of both mice and rats. Importantly, we found that systemic administration of recombinant FGF2 (rFGF2) in mice, or rFGF2 infusion into the dorsal striatum or DMS of rats, increased alcohol consumption and preference, with no similar effects on saccharin or sucrose consumption. Finally, we found that inhibition of the endogenous FGF2 function in the DMS, by an anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibody, suppressed alcohol consumption and preference. Together, our results suggest that alcohol consumption increases the expression of &lt;i&gt;Fgf2&lt;/i&gt; in the DMS, and that striatal FGF2 promotes alcohol consumption, suggesting that FGF2 in the DMS is a positive regulator of alcohol drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-term alcohol intake may lead to neuroadaptations in the mesostriatal reward system, resulting in addiction phenotypes. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is crucial for the development and maintenance of the mesostriatal dopaminergic system. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of FGF2 in alcohol-drinking behaviors. We show that alcohol increases &lt;i&gt;Fgf2&lt;/i&gt; expression in the dorsal striatum, an effect mediated via dopamine D2-like receptors. Importantly, we show that infusion of recombinant FGF2 into the dorsomedial striatum increases alcohol consumption, whereas inhibiting the endogenous FGF2 function suppresses consumption. Thus, FGF2 is an alcohol-responsive gene constituting a positive regulatory feedback loop with alcohol. This loop leads to facilitation of alcohol consumption, marking FGF2 as a potential new therapeutic target for alcohol addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Asymmetric Dichoptic Masking in Visual Cortex of Amblyopic Macaque Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8734?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8734?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In amblyopia, abnormal visual experience leads to an extreme form of eye dominance, in which vision through the nondominant eye is degraded. A key aspect of this disorder is perceptual suppression: the image seen by the stronger eye often dominates during binocular viewing, blocking the image of the weaker eye from reaching awareness. Interocular suppression is the focus of ongoing work aimed at understanding and treating amblyopia, yet its physiological basis remains unknown. We measured binocular interactions in visual cortex of anesthetized amblyopic monkeys (female &lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;), using 96-channel &quot;Utah&quot; arrays to record from populations of neurons in V1 and V2. In an experiment reported recently (Hallum et al., 2017), we found that reduced excitatory input from the amblyopic eye (AE) revealed a form of balanced binocular suppression that is unaltered in amblyopia. Here, we report on the modulation of the gain of excitatory signals from the AE by signals from its dominant fellow eye (FE). Using a dichoptic masking technique, we found that AE responses to grating stimuli were attenuated by the presentation of a noise mask to the FE, as in a normal control animal. Responses to FE stimuli, by contrast, could not be masked from the AE. We conclude that a weakened ability of the amblyopic eye to modulate cortical response gain creates an imbalance of suppression that favors the dominant eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In amblyopia, vision in one eye is impaired as a result of abnormal early visual experience. Behavioral observations in humans with amblyopia suggest that much of their visual loss is due to active suppression of their amblyopic eye. Here we describe experiments in which we studied binocular interactions in macaques with experimentally induced amblyopia. In normal monkeys, the gain of neuronal response to stimulation of one eye is modulated by contrast in the other eye, but in monkeys with amblyopia the balance of gain modulation is altered so that the weaker, amblyopic eye has little effect while the stronger fellow eye has a strong effect. This asymmetric suppression may be a key component of the perceptual losses in amblyopia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rodent Medial Frontal Control of Temporal Processing in the Dorsomedial Striatum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although frontostriatal circuits are critical for the temporal control of action, how time is encoded in frontostriatal circuits is unknown. We recorded from frontal and striatal neurons while rats engaged in interval timing, an elementary cognitive function that engages both areas. We report four main results. First, &quot;ramping&quot; activity, a monotonic change in neuronal firing rate across time, is observed throughout frontostriatal ensembles. Second, frontostriatal activity scales across multiple intervals. Third, striatal ramping neurons are correlated with activity of the medial frontal cortex. Finally, interval timing and striatal ramping activity are disrupted when the medial frontal cortex is inactivated. Our results support the view that striatal neurons integrate medial frontal activity and are consistent with drift-diffusion models of interval timing. This principle elucidates temporal processing in frontostriatal circuits and provides insight into how the medial frontal cortex exerts top-down control of cognitive processing in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to guide actions in time is essential to mammalian behavior from rodents to humans. The prefrontal cortex and striatum are critically involved in temporal processing and share extensive neuronal connections, yet it remains unclear how these structures represent time. We studied these two brain areas in rodents performing interval-timing tasks and found that time-dependent &quot;ramping&quot; activity, a monotonic increase or decrease in neuronal activity, was a key temporal signal. Furthermore, we found that striatal ramping activity was correlated with and dependent upon medial frontal activity. These results provide insight into information-processing principles in frontostriatal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The molecular signature and functional properties of astroglial subtypes in the adult CNS remain largely undefined. By using translational ribosome affinity purification followed by RNA-Seq, we profiled astroglial ribosome-associated (presumably translating) mRNAs in major cortical and subcortical brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and hypothalamus) of BAC &lt;i&gt;aldh1l1&lt;/i&gt;-translational ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) mice (both sexes). We found that the expression of astroglial translating mRNAs closely follows the dorsoventral axis, especially from cortex/hippocampus to thalamus/hypothalamus posteriorly. This region-specific expression pattern of genes, such as synaptogenic modulator &lt;i&gt;sparc&lt;/i&gt; and transcriptional factors (&lt;i&gt;emx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;lhx2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;hopx&lt;/i&gt;), was validated by qRT-PCR and immunostaining in brain sections. Interestingly, cortical or subcortical astrocytes selectively promote neurite growth and synaptic activity of neurons only from the same region in mismatched cocultures, exhibiting region-matched astrocyte to neuron communication. Overall, these results generated new molecular signature of astrocyte types in the adult CNS, providing insights into their origin and functional diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; molecular and functional heterogeneity of astrocytes inter-regionally from adult brain. Our results showed that the expression pattern of ribosome-associated mRNA profiles in astrocytes closely follows the dorsoventral axis, especially posteriorly from cortex/hippocampus to thalamus/hypothalamus. In line with this, our functional results further demonstrated region-selective roles of cortical and subcortical astrocytes in regulating cortical or subcortical neuronal synaptogenesis and maturation. These &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies provide a previously uncharacterized and important molecular atlas for exploring region-specific astroglial functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transcriptomic Analysis of Ribosome-Bound mRNA in Cortical Neurites In Vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Localized translation in neurites helps regulate synaptic strength and development. Dysregulation of local translation is associated with many neurological disorders. However, due to technical limitations, study of this phenomenon has largely been limited to brain regions with laminar organization of dendrites such as the hippocampus or cerebellum. It has not been examined in the cortex, a region of importance for most neurological disorders, where dendrites of each neuronal population are densely intermingled with cell bodies of others. Therefore, we have developed a novel method, SynapTRAP, which combines synaptoneurosomal fractionation with translating ribosome affinity purification to identify ribosome-bound mRNA in processes of genetically defined cell types. We demonstrate SynapTRAP's efficacy and report local translation in the cortex of mice, where we identify a subset of mRNAs that are translated in dendrites by neuronal ribosomes. These mRNAs have disproportionately longer lengths, enrichment for FMRP binding and G-quartets, and their genes are under greater evolutionary constraint in humans. In addition, we show that alternative splicing likely regulates this phenomenon. Overall, SynapTRAP allows for rapid isolation of cell-type-specific localized translation and is applicable to classes of previously inaccessible neuronal and non-neuronal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Instructions for making proteins are found in the genome, housed within the nucleus of each cell. These are then copied as RNA and exported to manufacture new proteins. However, in the brain, memory is thought to be encoded by strengthening individual connections (synapses) between neurons far from the nucleus. Thus, to efficiently make new proteins specifically where they are needed, neurons can transport RNAs to sites near synapses to locally produce proteins. Importantly, several mutations that cause autism disrupt this process. It has been assumed this process occurs in all brain regions, but has never been measured in the cortex. We applied a newly developed method measure to study, for the first time, local translation in cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: AgRP Neurons Can Increase Food Intake during Conditions of Appetite Suppression and Inhibit Anorexigenic Parabrachial Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8678?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To maintain energy homeostasis, orexigenic (appetite-inducing) and anorexigenic (appetite suppressing) brain systems functionally interact to regulate food intake. Within the hypothalamus, neurons that express agouti-related protein (AgRP) sense orexigenic factors and orchestrate an increase in food-seeking behavior. In contrast, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-expressing neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) suppress feeding. PBN CGRP neurons become active in response to anorexigenic hormones released following a meal, including amylin, secreted by the pancreas, and cholecystokinin (CCK), secreted by the small intestine. Additionally, exogenous compounds, such as lithium chloride (LiCl), a salt that creates gastric discomfort, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial cell wall component that induces inflammation, exert appetite-suppressing effects and activate PBN CGRP neurons. The effects of increasing the homeostatic drive to eat on feeding behavior during appetite suppressing conditions are unknown. Here, we show in mice that food deprivation or optogenetic activation of AgRP neurons induces feeding to overcome the appetite suppressing effects of amylin, CCK, and LiCl, but not LPS. AgRP neuron photostimulation can also increase feeding during chemogenetic-mediated stimulation of PBN CGRP neurons. AgRP neuron stimulation reduces Fos expression in PBN CGRP neurons across all conditions. Finally, stimulation of projections from AgRP neurons to the PBN increases feeding following administration of amylin, CCK, and LiCl, but not LPS. These results demonstrate that AgRP neurons are sufficient to increase feeding during noninflammatory-based appetite suppression and to decrease activity in anorexigenic PBN CGRP neurons, thereby increasing food intake during homeostatic need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The motivation to eat depends on the relative balance of activity in distinct brain regions that induce or suppress appetite. An abnormal amount of activity in neurons that induce appetite can cause obesity, whereas an abnormal amount of activity in neurons that suppress appetite can cause malnutrition and a severe reduction in body weight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a population of neurons known to induce appetite (&quot;AgRP neurons&quot;) could induce food intake to overcome appetite-suppression following administration of various appetite-suppressing compounds. We found that stimulating AgRP neurons could overcome various forms of appetite suppression and decrease neural activity in a separate population of appetite-suppressing neurons, providing new insights into how the brain regulates food intake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Desensitization Observed at Multiple Effectors of Somatic {mu}-Opioid Receptors Underlies Sustained Agonist-Mediated Inhibition of Proopiomelanocortin Neuron Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Activation of somatic μ-opioid receptors (MORs) in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons leads to the activation of G-protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels and hyperpolarization, but in response to continued signaling MORs undergo acute desensitization resulting in robust reduction in the peak GIRK current after minutes of agonist exposure. We hypothesized that the attenuation of the GIRK current would lead to a recovery of neuronal excitability whereby desensitization of the receptor would lead to a new steady state of POMC neuron activity reflecting the sustained GIRK current observed after the initial decline from peak with continued agonist exposure. However, electrophysiologic recordings and GCaMP6f Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in POMC neurons in mouse brain slices indicate that maximal inhibition of cellular activity by these measures can be maintained after the GIRK current declines. Blockade of the GIRK current by Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Tertiapin-Q did not disrupt the sustained inhibition of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in the continued presence of agonist, indicating the activation of an effector other than GIRK channels. Use of an irreversible MOR antagonist and Furchgott analysis revealed a low receptor reserve for the activation of GIRK channels but a &amp;gt;90% receptor reserve for the inhibition of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; events. Altogether, the data show that somatodendritic MORs in POMC neurons inhibit neuronal activity through at least two effectors with distinct levels of receptor reserve and that differentially reflect receptor desensitization. Thus, in POMC cells, the decline in the GIRK current during prolonged MOR agonist exposure does not reflect an increase in cellular activity as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is thought to underlie the development of cellular tolerance to opiate therapy. The present studies focused on MOR desensitization in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons as these neurons produce the endogenous opioid β-endorphin and are heavily regulated by opioids. Prolonged activation of somatic MORs in POMC neurons robustly inhibited action potential firing and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity despite desensitization of the MOR and reduced activation of a potassium current over the same time course. The data show that somatic MORs in POMC neurons couple to multiple effectors that have differential sensitivity to desensitization of the receptor. Thus, in these cells, the cellular consequence of MOR desensitization cannot be defined by the activity of a single effector system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 8 Alters Synapse Composition and Function, Resulting in Behavioral Defects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diverse molecular mechanisms regulate synaptic composition and function in the mammalian nervous system. The multifunctional protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) possesses both methyltransferase and phospholipase activities. Here we examine the role of this neuron-specific protein in hippocampal plasticity and cognitive function. PRMT8 protein localizes to synaptic sites, and conditional whole-brain &lt;i&gt;Prmt8&lt;/i&gt; deletion results in altered levels of multiple synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, using both male and female mice. Interestingly, these altered protein levels are due to post-transcriptional mechanisms as the corresponding mRNA levels are unaffected. Strikingly, electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices of mice lacking PRMT8 reveal multiple defects in excitatory synaptic function and plasticity. Furthermore, behavioral analyses show that PRMT8 conditional knock-out mice exhibit impaired hippocampal-dependent fear learning. Together, these findings establish PRMT8 as an important component of the molecular machinery required for hippocampal neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Numerous molecular processes are critically required for normal brain function. Here we use mice lacking protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) in the brain to examine how loss of this protein affects the structure and function of neurons in the hippocampus. We find that PRMT8 localizes to the sites of communication between neurons. Hippocampal neurons from mice lacking PRMT8 have no detectable structural differences compared with controls; however, multiple aspects of their function are altered. Consistently, we find that mice lacking PRMT8 also exhibit reduced hippocampus-dependent memory. Together, our findings establish important roles for PRMT8 in regulating neuron function and cognition in the mammalian brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Myelinogenic Plasticity of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells following Spinal Cord Contusion Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous remyelination occurs after spinal cord injury (SCI), but the extent of myelin repair and identity of the cells responsible remain incompletely understood and contentious. We assessed the cellular origin of new myelin by fate mapping platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), Olig2+, and P0+ cells following contusion SCI in mice. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs; PDGFRα+) produced oligodendrocytes responsible for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ensheathment of ~30% of myelinated spinal axons at injury epicenter 3 months after SCI, demonstrating that these resident cells are a major contributor to oligodendrocyte regeneration. OPCs also produced the majority of myelinating Schwann cells in the injured spinal cord; invasion of peripheral myelinating (P0+) Schwann cells made only a limited contribution. These findings reveal that PDGFRα+ cells perform diverse roles in CNS repair, as multipotential progenitors that generate both classes of myelinating cells. This endogenous repair might be exploited as a therapeutic target for CNS trauma and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to profound functional deficits, though substantial numbers of axons often survive. One possible explanation for these deficits is loss of myelin, creating conduction block at the site of injury. SCI leads to oligodendrocyte death and demyelination, and clinical trials have tested glial transplants to promote myelin repair. However, the degree and duration of myelin loss, and the extent and mechanisms of endogenous repair, have been contentious issues. Here, we use genetic fate mapping to demonstrate that spontaneous myelin repair by endogenous oligodendrocyte precursors is much more robust than previously recognized. These findings are relevant to many types of CNS pathology, raising the possibility that CNS precursors could be manipulated to repair myelin in lieu of glial transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: When Brain Beats Behavior: Neuroforecasting Crowdfunding Outcomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8625?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although traditional economic and psychological theories imply that individual choice best scales to aggregate choice, primary components of choice reflected in neural activity may support even more generalizable forecasts. Crowdfunding represents a significant and growing platform for funding new and unique projects, causes, and products. To test whether neural activity could forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes weeks later, 30 human subjects (14 female) decided whether to fund proposed projects described on an Internet crowdfunding website while undergoing scanning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only NAcc activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes—even better than choice itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Forecasting aggregate behavior with individual neural data has proven elusive; even when successful, neural forecasts have not historically supplanted behavioral forecasts. In the current research, we find that neural responses can forecast market-level choice and outperform behavioral measures in a novel Internet crowdfunding context. Targeted as well as model-free analyses convergently indicated that nucleus accumbens activity can support aggregate forecasts. Beyond providing initial evidence for neuropsychological processes implicated in crowdfunding choices, these findings highlight the ability of neural features to forecast aggregate choice, which could inform applications relevant to business and policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociable Effects on Birdsong of Androgen Signaling in Cortex-Like Brain Regions of Canaries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8612?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neural basis of how learned vocalizations change during development and in adulthood represents a major challenge facing cognitive neuroscience. This plasticity in the degree to which learned vocalizations can change in both humans and songbirds is linked to the actions of sex steroid hormones during ontogeny but also in adulthood in the context of seasonal changes in birdsong. We investigated the role of steroid hormone signaling in the brain on distinct features of birdsong using adult male canaries (&lt;i&gt;Serinus canaria&lt;/i&gt;), which show extensive seasonal vocal plasticity as adults. Specifically, we bilaterally implanted the potent androgen receptor antagonist flutamide in two key brain regions that control birdsong. We show that androgen signaling in the motor cortical-like brain region, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), controls syllable and trill bandwidth stereotypy, while not significantly affecting higher order features of song such syllable-type usage (i.e., how many times each syllable type is used) or syllable sequences. In contrast, androgen signaling in the premotor cortical-like brain region, HVC (proper name), controls song variability by increasing the variability of syllable-type usage and syllable sequences, while having no effect on syllable or trill bandwidth stereotypy. Other aspects of song, such as the duration of trills and the number of syllables per song, were also differentially affected by androgen signaling in HVC versus RA. These results implicate androgens in regulating distinct features of complex motor output in a precise and nonredundant manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Vocal plasticity is linked to the actions of sex steroid hormones, but the precise mechanisms are unclear. We investigated this question in adult male canaries (&lt;i&gt;Serinus canaria&lt;/i&gt;), which show extensive vocal plasticity throughout their life. We show that androgens in two cortex-like vocal control brain regions regulate distinct aspects of vocal plasticity. For example, in HVC (proper name), androgens regulate variability in syntax but not phonology, whereas androgens in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) regulate variability in phonology but not syntax. Temporal aspects of song were also differentially affected by androgen signaling in HVC versus RA. Thus, androgen signaling may reduce vocal plasticity by acting in a nonredundant and precise manner in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PTEN Loss Increases the Connectivity of Fast Synaptic Motifs and Functional Connectivity in a Developing Hippocampal Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8595?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/36/8595?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes in synaptic strength and connectivity are thought to be a major mechanism through which many gene variants cause neurological disease. Hyperactivation of the PI3K-mTOR signaling network, via loss of function of repressors such as PTEN, causes epilepsy in humans and animal models, and altered mTOR signaling may contribute to a broad range of neurological diseases. Changes in synaptic transmission have been reported in animal models of PTEN loss; however, the full extent of these changes, and their effect on network function, is still unknown. To better understand the scope of these changes, we recorded from pairs of mouse hippocampal neurons cultured in a two-neuron microcircuit configuration that allowed us to characterize all four major connection types within the hippocampus. Loss of PTEN caused changes in excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, and these changes were postsynaptic, presynaptic, and transynaptic, suggesting that disruption of PTEN has the potential to affect most connection types in the hippocampal circuit. Given the complexity of the changes at the synaptic level, we measured changes in network behavior after deleting &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt; from neurons in an organotypic hippocampal slice network. Slices containing &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt;-deleted neurons showed increased recruitment of neurons into network bursts. Importantly, these changes were not confined to &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt;-deleted neurons, but involved the entire network, suggesting that the extensive changes in synaptic connectivity rewire the entire network in such a way that promotes a widespread increase in functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Homozygous deletion of the &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt; gene in neuronal subpopulations in the mouse serves as a valuable model of epilepsy caused by mTOR hyperactivation. To better understand how gene deletions lead to altered neuronal activity, we investigated the synaptic and network effects that occur 1 week after &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt; deletion. PTEN loss increased the connectivity of all four types of hippocampal synaptic connections, including two forms of increased inhibition of inhibition, and increased network functional connectivity. These data suggest that single gene mutations that cause neurological diseases such as epilepsy may affect a surprising range of connection types. Moreover, given the robustness of homeostatic plasticity, these diverse effects on connection types may be necessary to cause network phenotypes such as increased synchrony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01437</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in
spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in sensory processing is
to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common
encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are
typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because
only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior).
However, previous solutions usually require all-to-all connectivity,
inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose a
principled algorithm that provably reaches the MAP inference solution but using
sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the mouse olfactory bulb, but
our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities; in addition, it
should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in
conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's
subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular
on-demand music streaming services. Our study resulted into two variants,
differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving
distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method,
NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the
well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands,
activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second
method, NeuroPicksVQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies
on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a
novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves. Beyond the feature
engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme
learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the
derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find
applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems,
while NeuroPicksVQ can control the selection of music tracks. Encouraging
experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the systems, are presented.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Allen Brain Atlas project (ABA) generated a genome-scale collection of
gene-expression profiles using in-situ hybridization. These profiles were
co-registered to the three-dimensional Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) of the adult
mouse brain. A set of more than 4,000 such volumetric data are available for
the full brain, at a resolution of 200 microns. These data are presented in a
voxel-by-gene matrix. The ARA comes with several systems of annotation,
hierarchical (40 cortical regions, 209 sub-cortical regions in the whole
brain), or non-hierarchical (12 regions in the left hemisphere, with refinement
into 94 regions, and cortical layers). The high-dimensional nature of this
dataset and the possible connection between anatomy and gene expression pose
challenges to data analysis. We developed the Brain Gene Expression Analysis
Toolbox, whose functionalities include: determination of marker genes for brain
regions, statistical analysis of brain-wide co-expression patterns, and the
computation of brain-wide correlation maps with cell-type specific microarray
data.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Transient hypothyroidism favors oligodendrocyte generation providing functional remyelination in the adult mouse brain</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29996</link>
	<description>In the adult brain, both neurons and oligodendrocytes can be generated from neural stem cells located within the Sub-Ventricular Zone (SVZ). Physiological signals regulating neuronal &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; glial fate are largely unknown. Here we report that a thyroid hormone (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-free window, with or without a demyelinating insult, provides a favorable environment for SVZ-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor generation. After demyelination, oligodendrocytes derived from these newly-formed progenitors provide functional remyelination, restoring normal conduction speed. The cellular basis for neuronal &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; glial determination in progenitors involves asymmetric partitioning of EGFR and TRα1, expression of which favor glio-and neurogenesis, respectively. Moreover, EGFR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not neuroblasts, express high levels of a T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-inactivating deiodinase, Dio3. Thus, TRα absence with high levels of Dio3 provides double-pronged blockage of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action during glial lineage commitment. These findings not only transform our understanding of how T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; orchestrates adult brain lineage decisions, but also provide potential insight into demyelinating disorders.</description>

	<description>In animal embryos, control of development is passed from exclusively maternal gene products to those encoded by the embryonic genome in a process referred to as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We show that the RNA-binding protein, ME31B, binds to and represses the expression of thousands of maternal mRNAs during the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; MZT. However, ME31B carries out repression in different ways during different phases of the MZT. Early, it represses translation while, later, its binding leads to mRNA destruction, most likely as a consequence of translational repression in the context of robust mRNA decay. In a process dependent on the PNG kinase, levels of ME31B and its partners, Cup and Trailer Hitch (TRAL), decrease by over 10-fold during the MZT, leading to a change in the composition of mRNA-protein complexes. We propose that ME31B is a global repressor whose regulatory impact changes based on its biological context.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating short-term synaptic plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spiking</title>

Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) critically affects the processing of information in neuronal circuits by reversibly changing the effective strength of connections between neurons on time scales from milliseconds to a few seconds. STP is traditionally studied using intracellular recordings of postsynaptic potentials or currents evoked by presynaptic spikes. However, STP also affects the statistics of postsynaptic spikes. Here we present two model-based approaches for estimating synaptic weights and short-term plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spike observations alone. We extend a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicts postsynaptic spiking as a function of the observed pre- and postsynaptic spikes and allow the connection strength (coupling term in the GLM) to vary as a function of time based on the history of presynaptic spikes. Our first model assumes that STP follows a Tsodyks-Markram description of vesicle depletion and recovery. In a second model, we introduce a functional description of STP where we estimate the coupling term as a biophysically unrestrained function of the presynaptic inter-spike intervals. To validate the models, we test the accuracy of STP estimation using the spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons with known synaptic dynamics. We first test our models using the responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to simulated presynaptic input with different types of STP, and then use simulated spike trains to examine the effects of spike-frequency adaptation, stochastic vesicle release, spike sorting errors, and common input. We find that, using only spike observations, both model-based methods can accurately reconstruct the time-varying synaptic weights of presynaptic inputs for different types of STP. Our models also capture the differences in postsynaptic spike responses to presynaptic spikes following short vs long inter-spike intervals, similar to results reported for thalamocortical connections. These models may thus be useful tools for characterizing short-term plasticity from multi-electrode spike recordings in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bi9xTDVaR8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: kWIP: The &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer weighted inner product, a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; estimator of genetic similarity</title>

Modern genomics techniques generate overwhelming quantities of data. Extracting population genetic variation demands computationally efficient methods to determine genetic relatedness between individuals (or “samples”) in an unbiased manner, preferably &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. Rapid estimation of genetic relatedness directly from sequencing data has the potential to overcome reference genome bias, and to verify that individuals belong to the correct genetic lineage before conclusions are drawn using mislabelled, or misidentified samples. We present the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer Weighted Inner Product (kWIP), an assembly-, and alignment-free estimator of genetic similarity. kWIP combines a probabilistic data structure with a novel metric, the weighted inner product (WIP), to efficiently calculate pairwise similarity between sequencing runs from their &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer counts. It produces a distance matrix, which can then be further analysed and visualised. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the underlying genomes and applications include establishing sample identity and detecting mix-up, non-obvious genomic variation, and population structure. We show that kWIP can reconstruct the true relatedness between samples from simulated populations. By re-analysing several published datasets we show that our results are consistent with marker-based analyses. kWIP is written in C++, licensed under the GNU GPL, and is available from https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tulTaPSFLkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Protein inference, the identification of the protein set that is the origin of a given peptide profile, is a fundamental challenge in proteomics. We present DeepPep, a deep-convolutional neural network framework that predicts the protein set from a proteomics mixture, given the sequence universe of possible proteins and a target peptide profile. In its core, DeepPep quantifies the change in probabilistic score of peptide-spectrum matches in the presence or absence of a specific protein, hence selecting as candidate proteins those with the largest impact to the peptide profile. Application of the method across datasets argues for its competitive predictive ability (AUC of 0.80±0.18, AUPR of 0.84±0.28) in inferring proteins without need of peptide detectability on which the most competitive method rely. We find that the convolutional neural network architecture outperforms the traditional artificial neural network architectures without convolution layers in protein inference. We expect that similar deep learning architectures that allow learning nonlinear patterns can be further extended to problems in metagenome profiling and cell type inference. The source code of DeepPep and the benchmark datasets used in this study are available at https://deeppep.github.io/DeepPep/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZthcKVb-HhE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The human genome contains ∼30,000 CpG islands (CGIs). While CGIs associated with promoters nearly always remain unmethylated, many of the ∼9,000 CGIs lying within gene bodies become methylated during development and differentiation. Both promoter and intragenic CGIs may also become abnormally methylated as a result of genome rearrangements and in...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/kUxcFtd0bps&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Circadian repression of CLOCK-BMAL1 by PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) in mammals lies at the core of the circadian timekeeping mechanism. CRY repression of CLOCK-BMAL1 and regulation of circadian period are proposed to rely primarily on competition for binding with coactivators on an α-helix located within the transactivation domain (TAD) of...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/ScdU7pahUy8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Multiple studies have identified conserved genetic pathways and small molecules associated with extension of lifespan in diverse organisms. However, extending lifespan does not result in concomitant extension in healthspan, defined as the proportion of time that an animal remains healthy and free of age-related infirmities. Rather, mutations that extend lifespan...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/N6jSAz4VjTw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~3/BC7Z54ioSLQ/E7499.short</link>
	<description>Coevolutionary models suggest that herbivores drive diversification and community composition in plants. For herbivores, many questions remain regarding how plant defenses shape host choice and community structure. We addressed these questions using the tree genus Inga and its lepidopteran herbivores in the Amazon. We constructed phylogenies for both plants and...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/BC7Z54ioSLQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~3/UUmYkqEuvJo/E7489.short</link>
	<description>Phytoplankton community structure is shaped by both bottom–up factors, such as nutrient availability, and top–down processes, such as predation. Here we show that marine viruses can blur these distinctions, being able to amend how host cells acquire nutrients from their environment while also predating and lysing their algal hosts.

	<description>Circadian clock oscillation emerges in mouse embryo in the later developmental stages. Although circadian clock development is closely correlated with cellular differentiation, the mechanisms of its emergence during mammalian development are not well understood.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Training Spiking Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks: A Versatile Framework Compatible to Various Temporal Codes. (arXiv:1709.00583v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00583</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional modeling approaches have found limitations in matching the
increasingly detailed neural network structures and dynamics recorded in
experiments to the diverse brain functionalities. On another approach, studies
have demonstrated to train spiking neural networks for simple functions using
supervised learning. Here, we introduce a modified SpikeProp learning
algorithm, which achieved better learning stability in different activity
states. In addition, we show biological realistic features such as lateral
connections and sparse activities can be included in the network. We
demonstrate the versatility of this framework by implementing three well-known
temporal codes for different types of cognitive tasks, which are MNIST digits
recognition, spatial coordinate transformation, and motor sequence generation.
Moreover, we find several characteristic features have evolved alongside the
task training, such as selective activity, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and
weak pair-wise correlation. The coincidence between the self-evolved and
experimentally observed features indicates their importance on the brain
functionality. Our results suggest a unified setting in which diverse cognitive
computations and mechanisms can be studied.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, is a fundamental mechanism
of neuronal adaptation in response to changes in the environment or due to
brain injury. In this review, we show our results about the effects of synaptic
plasticity on neuronal networks composed by Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We show
that the final topology of the evolved network depends crucially on the ratio
between the strengths of the inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Excitation of
the same order of inhibition revels an evolved network that presents the
rich-club phenomenon, well known to exist in the brain. For initial networks
with considerably larger inhibitory strengths, we observe the emergence of a
complex evolved topology, where neurons sparsely connected to other neurons,
also a typical topology of the brain. The presence of noise enhances the
strength of both types of synapses, but if the initial network has synapses of
both natures with similar strengths. Finally, we show how the synchronous
behaviour of the evolved network will reflect its evolved topology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis can help in sensing instantaneous heart rate and instantaneous respiratory rate from photoplethysmography in a reliable way. (arXiv:1701.02072v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02072</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the population of the noninvasive, economic, comfortable, and
easy-to-install photoplethysmography (PPG), it is still lacking a
mathematically rigorous and stable algorithm which is able to simultaneously
extract from a single-channel PPG signal the instantaneous heart rate (IHR) and
the instantaneous respiratory rate (IRR). In this paper, a novel algorithm
called deppG is provided to tackle this challenge. deppG is composed of two
theoretically solid nonlinear-type time-frequency analyses techniques, the
de-shape short time Fourier transform and the synchrosqueezing transform, which
allows us to extract the instantaneous physiological information from the PPG
signal in a reliable way. To test its performance, in addition to validating
the algorithm by a simulated signal and discussing the meaning of
&quot;instantaneous&quot;, the algorithm is applied to two publicly available batch
databases, the Capnobase and the ICASSP 2015 signal processing cup. The former
contains PPG signals relative to spontaneous or controlled breathing in static
patients, and the latter is made up of PPG signals collected from subjects
doing intense physical activities. The accuracies of the estimated IHR and IRR
are compared with the ones obtained by other methods, and represent the
state-of-the-art in this field of research. The results suggest the potential
of deppG to extract instantaneous physiological information from a signal
acquired from widely available wearable devices, even when a subject carries
out intense physical activities.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alcohol improves cerebellar-learning deficit in myoclonus-dystonia - a clinical and electrophysiological investigation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives&lt;/em&gt;: To characterize neurophysiological subcortical abnormalities in myoclonus-dystonia and their modulation by alcohol administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Cerebellar associative learning and basal ganglia-brainstem interaction were investigated in 17 myoclonus-dystonia patients with &lt;em&gt;epsilon-sarcoglycan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SGCE)&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by means of classical eyeblink conditioning and blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake resulting in a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08% (0.8 g/l). The alcohol responsiveness of clinical symptoms was evaluated by three blinded raters with a standardized video protocol and clinical rating scales including the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) and the Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Patients showed a significantly reduced number of conditioned eyeblink responses before alcohol administration compared to controls. While the conditioning response rate decreased under alcohol intake in controls, it increased in patients (ANOVA: alcohol state x Group p = 0.004). Blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake did not differ between groups. Myoclonus improved significantly after alcohol intake (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016). The severity of action myoclonus at baseline correlated negatively with the conditioning response in classical eyeblink conditioning in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: The combination of findings with reduced baseline acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses and normal blink reflex recovery cycle in patients that improved significantly by alcohol intake suggests a crucial role of cerebellar networks in the generation of symptoms in these patients.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decreasing biomedical research support over the past decade has driven many talented young scientists to seek careers outside academia. In 2011, the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine developed an internal grant review program (IGRP) to systematically review career development awards (CDAs) and research grants (e.g., R01s) for junior investigators prior to NIH submission. With IGRP implementation, we observed significant increases in the number of CDAs and R-grants awarded to junior investigators. Thus, internal grant review is an effective means for supporting junior faculty and help them retain their research roles within academia. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Concussion in adolescence and risk of multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25036</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25036</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess whether concussion in childhood or adolescence is associated with subsequent multiple sclerosis risk. Previous research suggests an association but methodological limitations included retrospective data collection and small study populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The national Swedish Patient (hospital diagnoses) and Multiple Sclerosis registers were used to identify all MS diagnoses up to 2012 among people born from 1964, when the Patient Register was established. The 7292 patients with multiple sclerosis were matched individually with 10 people without MS by sex, year of birth, age/vital status at multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and region of residence (county), resulting in a study population of 80212. Diagnoses of concussion and control diagnoses of broken limb bones were identified using the Patient Register from birth to age 10 years or from ages 11 to 20 years. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Concussion in adolescence was associated with a raised risk of multiple sclerosis, producing adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of 1.22 (1.05-1.42, p=0.008) and 2.33 (1.35-4.04, p=0.002) for one diagnosis of concussion, or more than one diagnosis of concussion, respectively, compared with none. No notable association with multiple sclerosis was observed for concussion in childhood, or broken limb bones in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Head trauma in adolescence, particularly if repeated, is associated with a raised risk of future multiple sclerosis, possibly due to initiation of an autoimmune process in the central nervous system. This further emphasises the importance of protecting young people from head injuries. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Independent circuits in basal ganglia and cortex for the processing of reward and precision feedback. (arXiv:1709.00374v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00374</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00374</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to understand human decision making it is necessary to understand
how the brain uses feedback to guide goal-directed behavior. The ventral
striatum (VS) appears to be a key structure in this function, responding
strongly to explicit reward feedback. However, recent results have also shown
striatal activity following correct task performance even in the absence of
feedback. This raises the possibility that, in addition to processing external
feedback, the dopamine-centered reward circuit might regulate endogenous
reinforcement signals, like those triggered by satisfaction in accurate task
performance. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test
this idea. Participants completed a simple task that garnered both reward
feedback and feedback about the precision of performance. Importantly, the
design was such that we could manipulate information about the precision of
performance within different levels of reward magnitude. Using parametric
modulation and functional connectivity analysis we identified brain regions
sensitive to each of these signals. Our results show a double dissociation:
frontal and posterior cingulate regions responded to explicit reward but were
insensitive to task precision, whereas the dorsal striatum - and putamen in
particular - was insensitive to reward but responded strongly to precision
feedback in reward-present trials. Both types of feedback activated the VS, and
sensitivity in this structure to precision feedback was predicted by
personality traits related to approach behavior and reward responsiveness. Our
findings shed new light on the role of specific brain regions in integrating
different sources of feedback to guide goal-directed behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00339</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When searching for a target within an image our brain can adopt different
strategies, but which one does it choose? This question can be answered by
tracking the motion of the eye while it executes the task. Following many
individuals performing various search tasks we distinguish between two
competing strategies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a model that
captures the interplay of the search strategies and allows us to create
artificial eye-tracking trajectories, which could be compared to the
experimental ones. Identifying the model parameters allows us to quantify the
strategy employed in terms of ensemble averages, characterizing each
experimental cohort. In this way we can discern with high sensitivity the
relation between the visual landscape and the average strategy, disclosing how
small variations in the image induce changes in the strategy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the features of and mechanisms behind language learning can
provide insights into the general process of knowledge acquisition. Recent
methods from network science applied to language learning have advanced the
field, particularly by noting associations between densely connected words and
acquisition. However, the importance of sparse areas of the network, or
knowledge gaps, remains unexplored. Here we create a semantic feature network
in which words correspond to nodes and in which connections correspond to
semantic similarity. We develop a new analytical approach built on principles
of applied topology to query the prevalence of knowledge gaps, which we propose
manifest as cavities within the network. We detect topological cavities of
multiple dimensions in the growing semantic feature network of children ages 16
to 30 months. The pattern of cavity appearance matches that of a constrained
null model, created by predefining the affinity of each node for connections.
Furthermore, when word acquisition time is computed from children of mothers
with differing levels of education, we find that despite variation at the word
level, the global organization as measured by persistent homology remains
comparable. We show that topological properties of a node correlate with
filling in cavities better than simple lexical properties such as the length
and frequency of the corresponding word. Finally, we show that the large-scale
architecture of the semantic feature network is topologically accommodating to
many node orders. We discuss the importance of topology in language learning,
and we speculate that the formation and filling of knowledge gaps may be a
robust feature of knowledge acquisition.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The signatures of conscious access and phenomenology are consistent with large-scale brain communication at criticality. (arXiv:1709.00050v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conscious awareness refers to the association of information processing in
the brain that is accompanied by subjective, reportable experiences. Current
models of conscious access propose that sufficiently strong sensory stimuli
ignite a global network of regions allowing further processing. The immense
number of possible experiences indicates that brain activity associated with
conscious awareness must be highly differentiated. However, information must
also be integrated to account for the unitary nature of consciousness. We
present a conceptual computational model that identifies conscious access with
self-sustained percolation in an anatomical network. We show that if activity
propagates at the critical threshold, the amount of integrated information
(Phi) is maximal after conscious access, as well as other related markers. We
also identify a posterior hotspot of regions with high levels of information
sharing during conscious access. Finally, competitive activity spreading
qualitatively describes the results of paradigms such as backward masking and
binocular rivalry.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robustly representing inferential uncertainty in deep neural networks through sampling. (arXiv:1611.01639v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to increasingly challenging
problems, they will need to be able to represent their own uncertainty.
Modelling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Using
Bernoulli dropout with sampling at prediction time has recently been proposed
as an efficient and well performing variational inference method for DNNs.
However, sampling from other multiplicative noise based variational
distributions has not been investigated in depth. We evaluated Bayesian DNNs
trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units
(dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We tested the calibration of the
probabilistic predictions of Bayesian fully connected and convolutional DNNs on
two visual inference tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Sampling at prediction time
increased the quality of the DNNs' uncertainty estimates. Sampling weights,
whether Gaussian or Bernoulli, led to more accurate representation of
uncertainty compared to sampling of units. However, sampling units using either
Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to increased convolutional neural network
(CNN) classification accuracy. Based on these findings we used both Bernoulli
dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which we show approximates the
use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution without increasing the number
of learned parameters. We found that spike-and-slab sampling efficiently
combined the advantages of the other methods: it classifies with high accuracy
and robustly represents inferential uncertainty for all tested architectures.

Modelling ionic channels represents a fundamental step towards developing biologically detailed neuron models. Until recently, the voltage-gated ion channels have been mainly modelled according to the formalism introduced by the seminal works of Hodgkin and Huxley (HH). However, following the continuing achievements in the biophysical and molecular comprehension of these pore-forming transmembrane proteins, the HH formalism turned out to carry limitations and inconsistencies in reproducing the ion-channels electrophysiological behaviour. At the same time, Markov-type kinetic models have been increasingly proven to successfully replicate both the electrophysiological and biophysical features of different ion channels. However, in order to model even the finest non-conducting molecular conformational change, they are often equipped with a considerable number of states and related transitions, which make them computationally heavy and less suitable for implementation in conductance-based neurons and large networks of those. In this purely modelling study we develop a Markov-type kinetic model for all human voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). The model framework is detailed, unifying (i.e., it accounts for all ion-channel isoforms) and computationally efficient (i.e. with a minimal set of states and transitions). The electrophysiological data to be modelled are gathered from previously published studies on whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in mammalian cell lines heterologously expressing the human VGSC subtypes (from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 to Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9). By adopting a minimum sequence of states, and using the same state diagram for all the distinct isoforms, the model ensures the lightest computational load when used in neuron models and neural networks of increasing complexity. The transitions between the states are described by original ordinary differential equations, which represent the rate of the state transitions as a function of voltage (i.e., membrane potential). The kinetic model, developed in the NEURON simulation environment, appears to be the simplest and most parsimonious way for a detailed phenomenological description of the human VGSCs electrophysiological behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_o404RFqmDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information thereby leading to perception and behavior (i.e., the neural code) remains an important problem in neuroscience. When investigating the neural code, one must take into account the fact that neural activities are not independent but are actually correlated with one another. Such correlations are seen ubiquitously and have a strong impact on neural coding. Here we investigated how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Using a model based on known anatomical differences in receptive field center size and overlap, we initially predicted large differences in correlated activity across the maps. However, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings showed that, contrary to modeling predictions, electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this surprising result, we incorporated the effects of RF surround in our model. By systematically varying both the RF surround gain and size relative to that of the RF center, we found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. In particular, incorporating known physiological differences in RF structure between the three maps in our model gave rise to similar levels of correlation. Our results show that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ty2LC2VNPl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The capacity of pluripotent embryonic stem cells to differentiate into any cell type in the body makes them invaluable in the field of regenerative medicine. However, because of the complexity of both the core pluripotency network and the process of cell fate computation it is not yet possible to control the fate of stem cells. We present a theoretical model of stem cell fate computation that is based on Halley and Winkler’s Branching Process Theory (BPT) and on Greaves &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.’s agent-based computer simulation derived from that theoretical model. BPT abstracts the complex production and action of a Transcription Factor (TF) into a single critical branching process that may dissipate, maintain, or become supercritical. Here we take the single TF model and extend it to multiple interacting TFs, and build an agent-based simulation of multiple TFs to investigate the dynamics of such coupled systems. We have developed the simulation and the theoretical model together, in an iterative manner, with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of stem cell fate computation, in order to influence experimental efforts, which may in turn influence the outcome of cellular differentiation. The model used is an example of self-organization and could be more widely applicable to the modelling of other complex systems. The simulation based on this model, though currently limited in scope in terms of the biology it represents, supports the utility of the Halley and Winkler’s branching process model in describing the behaviour of stem cell gene regulatory networks. Our simulation demonstrates three key features: (i) the existence of a critical value of the branching process parameter, dependent on the details of the cistrome in question; (ii) the ability of an active cistrome to “ignite” an otherwise fully dissipated cistrome, and drive it to criticality; (iii) how coupling cistromes together can reduce their critical branching parameter values needed to drive them to criticality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r1JHEeymEL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A long tradition in theoretical neuroscience casts sensory processing in the
brain as the process of inferring the maximally consistent interpretations of
imperfect sensory input. Recently it has been shown that Gamma-band inhibition
can enable neural attractor networks to approximately carry out such a sampling
mechanism. In this paper we propose a novel neural network model based on
irregular gating inhibition, show analytically how it implements a Monte-Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMC) sampler, and describe how it can be used to model networks
of both neural attractors as well as of single spiking neurons. Finally we show
how this model applied to spiking neurons gives rise to a new putative
mechanism that could be used to implement stochastic synaptic weights in
biological neural networks and in neuromorphic hardware.

	<description>In mammals, acoustic information arises in the cochlea and is transmitted to the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN). Three groups of VCN neurons extract different features from the firing of auditory nerve fibers and convey that information along separate pathways through the brainstem. Two of these pathways process temporal information: octopus cells detect coincident firing among auditory nerve fibers and transmit signals along monaural pathways, and bushy cells sharpen the encoding of fine structure and feed binaural pathways.</description>

Intracellular calcium cycling is a vital component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The key structures responsible for controlling calcium dynamics are the cell membrane (comprising the surface sarcolemma and transverse-tubules), the intracellular calcium store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the co-localisation of these two structures to form dyads within which calcium-induced-calcium-release occurs. The organisation of these structures tightly controls intracellular calcium dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of intracellular calcium cycling in three-dimensions (3-D), which incorporates high resolution reconstructions of these key regulatory structures, attained through imaging of tissue taken from the sheep left ventricle using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. An approach was developed to model the sarcoplasmic reticulum structure at the whole-cell scale, by reducing its full 3-D structure to a 3-D network of one-dimensional strands. The model reproduces intracellular calcium dynamics during control pacing and reveals the high-resolution 3-D spatial structure of calcium gradients and intracellular fluxes in both the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated the capability of the model to reproduce potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics under perturbed conditions, pertaining to calcium-transient alternans and spontaneous release events. Comparison with idealised cell models emphasised the importance of structure in determining calcium gradients and controlling the spatial dynamics associated with calcium-transient alternans, wherein the probabilistic nature of dyad activation and recruitment was constrained. The model was further used to highlight the criticality in calcium spark propagation in relation to inter-dyad distances. The model presented provides a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular calcium handling phenomena at the whole-cell. The approach allows for the first time direct integration of high-resolution images of 3-D intracellular structures with models of calcium cycling, presenting the possibility to directly assess the functional impact of structural remodelling at the cellular scale.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l1xtSADDZ4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Echolocation is the ability to use sound-echoes to infer spatial information about the environment. Some blind people have developed extraordinary proficiency in echolocation using mouth-clicks. The first step of human biosonar is the transmission (mouth click) and subsequent reception of the resultant sound through the ear. Existing head-related transfer function (HRTF) data bases provide descriptions of reception of the resultant sound. For the current report, we collected a large database of click emissions with three blind people expertly trained in echolocation, which allowed us to perform unprecedented analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the first ever description of the spatial distribution (i.e. beam pattern) of human expert echolocation transmissions, as well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail not available before. Our data show that transmission levels are fairly constant within a 60° cone emanating from the mouth, but levels drop gradually at further angles, more than for speech. In terms of spectro-temporal features, our data show that emissions are consistently very brief (~3ms duration) with peak frequencies 2-4kHz, but with energy also at 10kHz. This differs from previous reports of durations 3-15ms and peak frequencies 2-8kHz, which were based on less detailed measurements. Based on our measurements we propose to model transmissions as sum of monotones modulated by a decaying exponential, with angular attenuation by a modified cardioid. We provide model parameters for each echolocator. These results are a step towards developing computational models of human biosonar. For example, in bats, spatial and spectro-temporal features of emissions have been used to derive and test model based hypotheses about behaviour. The data we present here suggest similar research opportunities within the context of human echolocation. Relatedly, the data are a basis to develop synthetic models of human echolocation that could be virtual (i.e. simulated) or real (i.e. loudspeaker, microphones), and which will help understanding the link between physical principles and human behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MUsIJbXVblY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continual One-Shot Learning of Hidden Spike-Patterns with Neural Network Simulation Expansion and STDP Convergence Predictions. (arXiv:1708.09072v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09072</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a constructive algorithm that achieves successful
one-shot learning of hidden spike-patterns in a competitive detection task. It
has previously been shown (Masquelier et al., 2008) that spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP) and lateral inhibition can result in neurons competitively
tuned to repeating spike-patterns concealed in high rates of overall
presynaptic activity. One-shot construction of neurons with synapse weights
calculated as estimates of converged STDP outcomes results in immediate
selective detection of hidden spike-patterns. The capability of continual
learning is demonstrated through the successful one-shot detection of new sets
of spike-patterns introduced after long intervals in the simulation time.
Simulation expansion (Lightheart et al., 2013) has been proposed as an approach
to the development of constructive algorithms that are compatible with
simulations of biological neural networks. A simulation of a biological neural
network may have orders of magnitude fewer neurons and connections than the
related biological neural systems; therefore, simulated neural networks can be
assumed to be a subset of a larger neural system. The constructive algorithm is
developed using simulation expansion concepts to perform an operation
equivalent to the exchange of neurons between the simulation and the larger
hypothetical neural system. The dynamic selection of neurons to simulate within
a larger neural system (hypothetical or stored in memory) may be a starting
point for a wide range of developments and applications in machine learning and
the simulation of biology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Balance of excitation and inhibition determines 1/f power spectrum in neuronal networks. (arXiv:1708.09042v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The $1/f$-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological
signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches,
constitute evidences of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro
studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some
specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a
basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack
of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous
avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches.
Here we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling
exponent $\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a
neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). We find
that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and
tends to the value $\beta = 1$ for a percentage of about 30%. More
specifically, $\beta$ is close to $2$, namely brownian noise, for purely
excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval $[1,1.4]$ as
the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20 and 30%, in agreement
with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition
affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the
analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological
conditions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Fetal Growth and Premature Delivery in Pregnant Women on Anti-epileptic Drugs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25031</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25031</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AED) use during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This study included singleton liveborns born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AED when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.1) and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.5: 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AED in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136 grams, respectively, as compared to no-AED WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR 2.0: 1.3-3.0) and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.9: 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns. The risk may vary by drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Degeneration of serotonin neurons triggers spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25030</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25030</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma or after stroke and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury or during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt;(G37R) mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutation were crossed to Tph2-CRE mice expressing CRE in serotonergic neurons. Measurement of long lasting reflex using EMG, behavioural follow up and histological techniques were used to characterize spasticity and motor phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Deleting mutant SOD1 expression selectively in brainstem serotonin neurons was sufficient to rescue loss of TPH2 immunoreactivity and largely preserve serotonin innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Furthermore, this abrogated constitutive activity of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and abolished spasticity in end-stage mice. Consistent with spasticity mitigating motor symptoms, selective deletion worsened motor function and accelerated the onset of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of serotonin neurons is necessary to trigger spasticity through the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The wide range of drugs targeting the serotonergic system could be useful to treat spasticity in neurological diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GABBR2 mutations determine phenotype in Rett syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. However, highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features often allocate patients into the boundary of the two conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical interventions. Therefore, we investigated the specific molecular mechanism that allows an understanding of the pathogenesis and relationship of these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We screened novel genetic factors from 34 RTT-like patients without &lt;em&gt;MECP2&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which account for ∼90% of RTT cases, by whole exome sequencing. The biological function of the discovered variants was assessed in cell culture and &lt;em&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified a recurring &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; variant in GABAB receptor R2 (&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;) that reduces the receptor function, whereas different &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; variants in EE patients possess a more profound effect in reducing receptor activity and are more responsive to agonist rescue in an animal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; is a genetic factor that determines RTT- or EE-like phenotype expression depending on the variant positions. &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;-mediated GABA signaling is a crucial factor in determining the severity and nature of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Seizure activity per se does not induce tissue damage markers in human neocortical focal epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contribution of recurring seizures to the progression of epileptogenesis is debated. Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated either in humans or in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on postsurgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal, and inflammatory molecules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion), and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analyzed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, perivascular CD3-positive T-lymphocyte clustering, and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II or in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-electroencephalography or intraoperative electrocorticography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in nonlesional epileptogenic cortex studied in postsurgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity per se contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies considered here.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gustatory and olfactory responses to stimulation of the human insula</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite numerous studies suggesting the role of insular cortex in the processing of gustatory and olfactory inputs, the exact location of olfactogustatory representation in the insula remains controversial. Here we provide a functional mapping of olfactory–gustatory responses to stimulation of the human insular cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reviewed 651 electrical stimulations of the insula that were performed in 221 patients, using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes, during the presurgical evaluation of drug-refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustatory sensations were evoked in 15 (2.7%) of the 550 stimulations that elicited a clinical response. They were exclusively obtained after stimulation of a relatively delimited zone of insula, located in its mid-dorsal part (posterior short gyrus). Six olfactory sensations (1.1%) could be obtained during stimulations of an insular region that partially overlapped with the gustatory representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides a functional mapping of gustatory representation in the insular posterior short gyrus and the first detailed description of olfactory sensations obtained by direct stimulation of mid-dorsal insula. Our data also show a spatial overlap between gustatory, olfactory, and oral somatosensory representation in the mid-dorsal insula, and suggest that this part of the insula may be an integrated oral sensory region that plays a key role in flavor perception. It also indicates that dysfunction in this region should be considered during the evaluation of gustatory and olfactory epileptic seizures.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary and secondary conditions leading to thiamine deficiency have overlapping features in children, presenting with acute episodes of encephalopathy, bilateral symmetric brain lesions, and high excretion of organic acids that are specific of thiamine-dependent mitochondrial enzymes, mainly lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and branched chain keto-acids. Undiagnosed and untreated thiamine deficiencies are often fatal or lead to severe sequelae. Herein, we describe the clinical and genetic characterization of 79 patients with inherited thiamine defects causing encephalopathy in childhood, identifying outcome predictors in patients with pathogenic &lt;em&gt;SLC19A3&lt;/em&gt; variants, the most common genetic etiology. We propose diagnostic criteria that will aid clinicians to establish a faster and accurate diagnosis so that early vitamin supplementation is considered.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Are there optical communication channels in the brain?. (arXiv:1708.08887v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite great progress in neuroscience, there are still fundamental
unanswered questions about the brain, including the origin of subjective
experience and consciousness. Some answers might rely on new physical
mechanisms. Given that biophotons have been discovered in the brain, it is
interesting to explore if neurons use photonic communication in addition to the
well-studied electro-chemical signals. Such photonic communication in the brain
would require waveguides. Here we review recent work [S. Kumar, K. Boone, J.
Tuszynski, P. Barclay, and C. Simon, Scientific Reports 6, 36508 (2016)]
suggesting that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides. The light
transmission in the myelinated axon was modeled, taking into account its
realistic imperfections, and experiments were proposed both in-vivo and
in-vitro to test this hypothesis. Potential implications for quantum biology
are discussed.

	<description>Making a choice requires a combination of urgency, which provides the drive to act, and perceptual analysis, which identifies the most advantageous alternative. In behaving monkeys, Thura and Cisek map these processes onto separate brain structures with a complex interplay.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Inhibitory Basal Ganglia Inputs Induce Excitatory Motor Signals in the Thalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30743-2?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30743-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Kim et al. show that inhibitory basal ganglia inputs yield excitatory motor signals in the thalamus and, in excess, promote PD-like motor abnormalities. These suggest that the role of inhibitory basal ganglia circuits should be re-evaluated with consideration of their ability to induce excitatory signals at post-synaptic targets.</description>

	<description>Howard B. Eichenbaum died in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 21, 2017, at age 69, following recent spine surgery. His official titles were William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Director of the Center for Memory and Brain at Boston University. But he was known more broadly as one of the world’s leading lights in the study of memory and the brain, whose scientific achievements, advocacy and leadership in the field, and openness and generosity in his thinking and his interactions with younger scholars were all parts of the tremendous impact he had on science.</description>

	<description>Input specificity is a fundamental property of long-term potentiation (LTP), but it is not known if learning is mediated by synapse-specific plasticity. Kim and Cho (2017) now show that fear conditioning is mediated by synapse-specific LTP in the amygdala, allowing animals to discriminate stimuli that predict threat from those that do not.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair. This two-pronged mechanism may explain neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Domain-based prediction of the human isoform interactome provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing</title>

Alternative splicing is known to remodel protein-protein interaction networks (“interactomes”), yet large-scale determination of isoform-specific interactions remains challenging. We present a domain-based method to predict the isoform interactome from the reference interactome. First, we construct the domain-resolved reference interactome by mapping known domain-domain interactions onto experimentally-determined interactions between reference proteins. Then, we construct the isoform interactome by predicting that an isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction. Our prediction framework is of high-quality when assessed by experimental data. The predicted human isoform interactome reveals extensive network remodeling by alternative splicing. Protein pairs interacting with different isoforms of the same gene tend to be more divergent in biological function, tissue expression, and disease phenotype than protein pairs interacting with the same isoforms. Our prediction method complements experimental efforts, and demonstrates that integrating structural domain information with interactomes provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pOE3h8IZjMI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A method of determining where to target surveillance efforts in heterogeneous epidemiological systems</title>

The spread of pathogens into new environments poses a considerable threat to human, animal, and plant health, and by extension, human and animal wellbeing, ecosystem function, and agricultural productivity, worldwide. Early detection through effective surveillance is a key strategy to reduce the risk of their establishment. Whilst it is well established that statistical and economic considerations are of vital importance when planning surveillance efforts, it is also important to consider epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen in question—including heterogeneities within the epidemiological system itself. One of the most pronounced realisations of this heterogeneity is seen in the case of vector-borne pathogens, which spread between ‘hosts’ and ‘vectors’—with each group possessing distinct epidemiological characteristics. As a result, an important question when planning surveillance for emerging vector-borne pathogens is where to place sampling resources in order to detect the pathogen as early as possible. We answer this question by developing a statistical function which describes the probability distributions of the prevalences of infection at first detection in both hosts and vectors. We also show how this method can be adapted in order to maximise the probability of early detection of an emerging pathogen within imposed sample size and/or cost constraints, and demonstrate its application using two simple models of vector-borne citrus pathogens. Under the assumption of a linear cost function, we find that sampling costs are generally minimised when either hosts or vectors, but not both, are sampled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsuotfhBM24&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: HLA class I haplotype diversity is consistent with selection for frequent existing haplotypes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005693</guid>

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes of the adaptive immune system. High allelic diversity in HLA is argued to be maintained by balancing selection, such as negative frequency-dependent selection or heterozygote advantage. Selective pressure against immune escape by pathogens can maintain appreciable frequencies of many different HLA alleles. The selection pressures operating on combinations of HLA alleles across loci, or haplotypes, have not been extensively evaluated since the high HLA polymorphism necessitates very large sample sizes, which have not been available until recently. We aimed to evaluate the effect of selection operating at the HLA haplotype level by analyzing HLA A~C~B~DRB1~DQB1 haplotype frequencies derived from over six million individuals genotyped by the National Marrow Donor Program registry. In contrast with alleles, HLA haplotype diversity patterns suggest purifying selection, as certain HLA allele combinations co-occur in high linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is positive (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;gt;0) among frequent haplotypes and negative (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;lt;0) among rare haplotypes. Fitting the haplotype frequency distribution to several population dynamics models, we found that the best fit was obtained when significant positive frequency-dependent selection (FDS) was incorporated. Finally, the Ewens-Watterson test of homozygosity showed excess homozygosity for 5-locus haplotypes within 23 US populations studied, with an average &lt;i&gt;Fnd&lt;/i&gt; of 28.43. Haplotype diversity is most consistent with purifying selection for HLA Class I haplotypes (HLA-A, -B, -C), and was not inferred for HLA Class II haplotypes (-DRB1 and—DQB1). We discuss our empirical results in the context of evolutionary theory, exploring potential mechanisms of selection that maintain high linkage disequilibrium in MHC haplotype blocks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/983RcTGNU5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of LIMK-1/Cofilin-1 pathway: A possible basis for alteration of neuronal morphology in experimental cerebral malaria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25028</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Loss of cognition even after survival is the salient feature of cerebral malaria (CM). Currently, the fate of neuronal morphology is not studied at the ultra-structural level in CM. Recent studies suggest that maintenance of neuronal morphology and dendritic spine density (actin dynamics in particular) are essential for proper cognitive functions. LIMK-1/Cofilin-1signaling pathway is known to involve in the maintenance of actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin-1, in executing learning and memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Using experimental mouse model, we analyzed the behavioural parameters of CM, asymptomatic mice by performing Rapid Murine Coma Behaviour Scale experiment (RMCBS). We performed Golgi-Cox staining to assess neuronal morphology, dendritic spine density and arborization in the brain cortex subjected to &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium berghei ANKA&lt;/em&gt; infection compared to asymptomatic, anemic and control groups. We studied the neural gene expression pattern of LIMK-1, cofilin-1 and β-actin in all the experimental groups by semi-quantitative, quantitative PCR followed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We observed significant loss of dendritic spine density, abnormal spine morphology, reduced dendritic arborization; extensive dendritic varicosities in the cortical neurons of CM infected brain. Further, these observations correlated with diminished protein levels of LIMK-1, cofilin-1, phospho-cofilin-1 and β-actin in the whole brain lysates as well as formation of actin-cofilin rods in the brain sections of mice symptomatic to CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Overall, our findings suggest that the altered neuronal morphology and dysregulation of LIMK-1/cofilin-1 pathway could affect the cognitive outcome after experimental CM. Therefore, this study could help to establish newer therapeutic strategies aiming long-term cognitive impairment after CM. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust averaging protects decisions from noise in neural computations</title>

An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant (‘robust averaging’). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of “late” noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brain’s resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7Oog0_4kM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a category theory approach to analogy: Analyzing re-representation and acquisition of numerical knowledge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jairo A. Navarrete, Pablo Dartnell&lt;/p&gt;

Category Theory, a branch of mathematics, has shown promise as a modeling framework for higher-level cognition. We introduce an algebraic model for &lt;i&gt;analogy&lt;/i&gt; that uses the language of category theory to explore analogy-related cognitive phenomena. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we use this model to explore three objects of study in cognitive literature. First, (a) we use &lt;i&gt;commutative diagrams&lt;/i&gt; to analyze an effect of playing particular educational board games on the learning of numbers. Second, (b) we employ a notion called &lt;i&gt;coequalizer&lt;/i&gt; as a formal model of re-representation that explains a property of computational models of analogy called “flexibility” whereby non-similar representational elements are considered matches and placed in structural correspondence. Finally, (c) we build a formal learning model which shows that re-representation, language processing and analogy making can explain the acquisition of knowledge of rational numbers. These objects of study provide a picture of acquisition of numerical knowledge that is compatible with empirical evidence and offers insights on possible connections between notions such as relational knowledge, analogy, learning, conceptual knowledge, re-representation and procedural knowledge. This suggests that the approach presented here facilitates mathematical modeling of cognition and provides novel ways to think about analogy-related cognitive phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sBo6FmxKjSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Multivariate decoding methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), are highly effective at extracting information from brain imaging data. Yet, the precise nature of the information that MVPA draws upon remains controversial. Most current theories emphasize the enhanced sensitivity imparted by aggregating across voxels that have mixed and weak selectivity. However, beyond the selectivity of individual voxels, neural variability is correlated across voxels, and such noise correlations may contribute importantly to accurate decoding. Indeed, a recent computational theory proposed that noise correlations enhance multivariate decoding from heterogeneous neural populations. Here we extend this theory from the scale of neurons to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and show that noise correlations between heterogeneous populations of voxels (i.e., voxels selective for different stimulus variables) contribute to the success of MVPA. Specifically, decoding performance is enhanced when voxels with high vs. low noise correlations (measured during rest or in the background of the task) are selected during classifier training. Conversely, voxels that are strongly selective for one class in a GLM or that receive high classification weights in MVPA tend to exhibit high noise correlations with voxels selective for the other class being discriminated against. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that this is a general property of fMRI data and that selectivity and noise correlations can have distinguishable influences on decoding. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that if there is signal in the data, the resulting above-chance classification accuracy is modulated by the magnitude of noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MRF7w8Pk05Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Data driven flexible backbone protein design</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005722</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark G. F. Sun, Philip M. Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Protein design remains an important problem in computational structural biology. Current computational protein design methods largely use physics-based methods, which make use of information from a single protein structure. This is despite the fact that multiple structures of many protein folds are now readily available in the PDB. While ensemble protein design methods can use multiple protein structures, they treat each structure independently. Here, we introduce a flexible backbone strategy, FlexiBaL-GP, which learns global protein backbone movements directly from multiple protein structures. FlexiBaL-GP uses the machine learning method of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models to learn a lower dimensional representation of the protein coordinates that best represent backbone movements. These learned backbone movements are used to explore alternative protein backbones, while engineering a protein within a parallel tempered MCMC framework. Using the human ubiquitin–USP21 complex as a model we demonstrate that our design strategy outperforms current strategies for the interface design task of identifying tight binding ubiquitin variants for USP21.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t6T6ch57tGE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From homeostasis to behavior: Balanced activity in an exploration of embodied dynamic environmental-neural interaction</title>

In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we describe a simple model of spontaneous neural dynamics that controls an agent moving in a simple virtual environment. These dynamics generate interesting brain-environment feedback interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics demonstrating the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for homeostatic plasticity both locally (local inhibition adjusting to balance excitatory input) as well as more globally (regional “task negative” activity that compensates for “task positive”, sensory input in another region) balancing neural activity and leading to more stable behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our results suggest complementary functional roles for both local and macroscale mechanisms in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and a novel functional role for macroscopic “task-negative” patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kCaFdi-3S6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spread of hospital-acquired infections: A comparison of healthcare networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005666</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Hha9dvbFa6M/article</link>

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories, and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hha9dvbFa6M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Phantom Limbs, Neuroprosthetics, and the Developmental Origins of Embodiment</title>

	<description>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopamine transporter imaging deficit predicts early transition to synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the usefulness of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging to identify idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) patients at risk for short-term development of clinically-defined synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared with 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls' mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed-up during 5.7 ± 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically-defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, multiple system atrophy in one) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs. 6% at three years, 33% vs. 18% at five years; log rank test, p=0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease-free after three years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and like-hood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after three years follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease-modification trials in IRBD.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: All Wrapped Up: Environmental Effects on Myelination</title>

	<description>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</description>

	<description>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</description>

	<description>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</description>
