	<description>&lt;p&gt;Controlling the internal representation space of a neural network is a
desirable feature because it allows to generate new data in a supervised
manner. In this paper we will show how this can be achieved while building a
low-dimensional mapping of the input stream, by deriving a generalized
algorithm starting from Self Organizing Maps (SOMs). SOMs are a kind of neural
network which can be trained with unsupervised learning to produce a
low-dimensional discretized mapping of the input space. They can be used for
the generation of new data through backward propagation of interpolations made
from the mapping grid. Unfortunately the final topology of the mapping space of
a SOM is not known before learning, so interpolating new data in a supervised
way is not an easy task. Here we will show a variation from the SOM algorithm
consisting in constraining the update of prototypes so that it is also a
function of the distance of its prototypes from extrinsically given targets in
the mapping space. We will demonstrate how such variants, that we will call
Supervised Topological Maps (STMs), allow for a supervised mapping where the
position of internal representations in the mapping space is determined by the
experimenter. Controlling the internal representation space in STMs reveals to
be an easier task than what is currently done using other algorithms such as
variational or adversarial autoencoders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multifunctionality is a well observed phenomenological feature of biological
neural networks and considered to be of fundamental importance to the survival
of certain species over time. These multifunctional neural networks are capable
of performing more than one task without changing any network connections. In
this paper we investigate how this neurological idiosyncrasy can be achieved in
an artificial setting with a modern machine learning paradigm known as
`Reservoir Computing'. A training technique is designed to enable a Reservoir
Computer to perform tasks of a multifunctional nature. We explore the critical
effects that changes in certain parameters can have on the Reservoir Computers'
ability to express multifunctionality. We also expose the existence of several
`untrained attractors'; attractors which dwell within the prediction state
space of the Reservoir Computer that were not part of the training. We conduct
a bifurcation analysis of these untrained attractors and discuss the
implications of our results.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simple RGC consists of a collection of ImageJ plugins to assist researchers
investigating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) injury models in addition to helping
assess the effectiveness of treatments. The first plugin named RGC Counter
accurately calculates the total number of RGCs from retinal wholemount images.
The second plugin named RGC Transduction measures the co-localisation between
two channels making it possible to determine the transduction efficiencies of
viral vectors and transgene expression levels. The third plugin named RGC Batch
is a batch image processor to deliver fast analysis of large groups of
microscope images. These ImageJ plugins make analysis of RGCs in retinal
wholemounts easy, quick, consistent, and less prone to unconscious bias by the
investigator. The plugins are freely available from the ImageJ update site
https://sites.imagej.net/Sonjoonho/.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Benchmark experiments are required to test, compare, tune, and understand
optimization algorithms. Ideally, benchmark problems closely reflect real-world
problem behavior. Yet, real-world problems are not always readily available for
benchmarking. For example, evaluation costs may be too high, or resources are
unavailable (e.g., software or equipment). As a solution, data from previous
evaluations can be used to train surrogate models which are then used for
benchmarking. The goal is to generate test functions on which the performance
of an algorithm is similar to that on the real-world objective function.
However, predictions from data-driven models tend to be smoother than the
ground-truth from which the training data is derived. This is especially
problematic when the training data becomes sparse. The resulting benchmarks may
not reflect the landscape features of the ground-truth, are too easy, and may
lead to biased conclusions. To resolve this, we use simulation of Gaussian
processes instead of estimation (or prediction). This retains the covariance
properties estimated during model training. While previous research suggested a
decomposition-based approach for a small-scale, discrete problem, we show that
the spectral simulation method enables simulation for continuous optimization
problems. In a set of experiments with an artificial ground-truth, we
demonstrate that this yields more accurate benchmarks than simply predicting
with the Gaussian process model.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Interpretation of Brain Morphology in Association to Alzheimer's Disease Dementia Classification Using Graph Convolutional Networks on Triangulated Meshes. (arXiv:2008.06151v1 [eess.IV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06151</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06151</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a mesh-based technique to aid in the classification of Alzheimer's
disease dementia (ADD) using mesh representations of the cortex and subcortical
structures. Deep learning methods for classification tasks that utilize
structural neuroimaging often require extensive learning parameters to
optimize. Frequently, these approaches for automated medical diagnosis also
lack visual interpretability for areas in the brain involved in making a
diagnosis. This work: (a) analyzes brain shape using surface information of the
cortex and subcortical structures, (b) proposes a residual learning framework
for state-of-the-art graph convolutional networks which offer a significant
reduction in learnable parameters, and (c) offers visual interpretability of
the network via class-specific gradient information that localizes important
regions of interest in our inputs. With our proposed method leveraging the use
of cortical and subcortical surface information, we outperform other machine
learning methods with a 96.35% testing accuracy for the ADD vs. healthy control
problem. We confirm the validity of our model by observing its performance in a
25-trial Monte Carlo cross-validation. The generated visualization maps in our
study show correspondences with current knowledge regarding the structural
localization of pathological changes in the brain associated to dementia of the
Alzheimer's type.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Learnability and Robustness of Shallow Neural Networks Learned With a Performance-Driven BP and a Variant PSO For Edge Decision-Making. (arXiv:2008.06135v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06135</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the computing resources are limited without the benefit from
GPU, especially in the edge devices of IoT enabled systems. It may not be easy
to implement complex AI models in edge devices. The Universal Approximation
Theorem states that a shallow neural network (SNN) can represent any nonlinear
function. However, how fat is an SNN enough to solve a nonlinear
decision-making problem in edge devices? In this paper, we focus on the
learnability and robustness of SNNs, obtained by a greedy tight force heuristic
algorithm (performance driven BP) and a loose force meta-heuristic algorithm (a
variant of PSO). Two groups of experiments are conducted to examine the
learnability and the robustness of SNNs with Sigmoid activation,
learned/optimised by KPI-PDBPs and KPI-VPSOs, where, KPIs (key performance
indicators: error (ERR), accuracy (ACC) and $F_1$ score) are the objectives,
driving the searching process. An incremental approach is applied to examine
the impact of hidden neuron numbers on the performance of SNNs,
learned/optimised by KPI-PDBPs and KPI-VPSOs. From the engineering prospective,
all sensors are well justified for a specific task. Hence, all sensor readings
should be strongly correlated to the target. Therefore, the structure of an SNN
should depend on the dimensions of a problem space. The experimental results
show that the number of hidden neurons up to the dimension number of a problem
space is enough; the learnability of SNNs, produced by KPI-PDBP, is better than
that of SNNs, optimized by KPI-VPSO, regarding the performance and learning
time on the training data sets; the robustness of SNNs learned by KPI-PDBPs and
KPI-VPSOs depends on the data sets; and comparing with other classic machine
learning models, ACC-PDBPs win for almost all tested data sets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A theoretical framework describing the set of interactions between neurons in
the brain, or functional connectivity, should include dynamical functions
representing the propagation of signal from one neuron to another. Green's
functions and response functions are natural candidates for this but, while
they are conceptually very useful, they are usually defined only for linear
time-translationally invariant systems. The brain, instead, behaves nonlinearly
and in a time-dependent way. Here, we use nonequilibrium Green's functions to
describe the time-dependent functional connectivity of a continuous-variable
network of neurons. We show how the connectivity is related to the measurable
response functions, and provide two illustrative examples via numerical
calculations, inspired from $\textit{C. elegans}$.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising method for automatically
design neural architectures. NAS adopts a search strategy to effectively
explore predefined search space to find architecture in search space with
outstanding performance with minimum searching cost. Bayesian optimization and
evolutionary algorithms are two commonly used search strategies, but they
suffer from computationally expensive, challenge to implement, and inefficient
exploration ability. In this paper, we propose to combine evolutionary
algorithm with a neural predictor that can significantly improve the
exploration ability of evolutionary algorithms for NAS. We designed a
graph-based neural predictor with uncertainty estimation and adopted an
acquisition function defined from this neural predictor to guide the
evolutionary algorithm to efficiently explore the search space. We further
designed a graph-based neural predictor to guide evolutionary algorithm to find
potentially superior offspring and speed up the evolutionary procedure. The
above two algorithms are denoted as NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP, respectively.
Experiments illustrate our proposed algorithms outperform many recently
proposed NAS algorithms on closed and open-domain search spaces with both
search speed and searched architecture's performance. On closed domain search
space NAS-Bench-101, with only 150 evaluated architectures, NPENAS-BO achieves
a mean test error 5.9%, and NPENAS-NP reaches 5.86%, which is close to the best
performance of 5.77% in the ORACLE setting. On the open domain search space
DARTS, with only 2.5 GPU days, NPENAS-BO found an architecture that achieves
the best test error 2.52% on CIFAR-10. With only 1.8 GPU days, NPENAS-NP finds
an architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance 2.44%. The code is
publicly available at \url{https://github.com/auroua/NPENASv1}.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Integration of Neural Network-Based Symbolic Regression in Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery. (arXiv:1912.04825v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Symbolic regression is a powerful technique that can discover analytical
equations that describe data, which can lead to explainable models and
generalizability outside of the training data set. In contrast, neural networks
have achieved amazing levels of accuracy on image recognition and natural
language processing tasks, but are often seen as black-box models that are
difficult to interpret and typically extrapolate poorly. Here we use a neural
network-based architecture for symbolic regression called the Equation Learner
(EQL) network and integrate it with other deep learning architectures such that
the whole system can be trained end-to-end through backpropagation. To
demonstrate the power of such systems, we study their performance on several
substantially different tasks. First, we show that the neural network can
perform symbolic regression and learn the form of several functions. Next, we
present an MNIST arithmetic task where a separate part of the neural network
extracts the digits. Finally, we demonstrate prediction of dynamical systems
where an unknown parameter is extracted through an encoder. We find that the
EQL-based architecture can extrapolate quite well outside of the training data
set compared to a standard neural network-based architecture, paving the way
for deep learning to be applied in scientific exploration and discovery.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Learning Non-Parametric Invariances from Data with Permanent Random Connectomes. (arXiv:1911.05266v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05266</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05266</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental problems in supervised classification and in machine
learning in general, is the modelling of non-parametric invariances that exist
in data. Most prior art has focused on enforcing priors in the form of
invariances to parametric nuisance transformations that are expected to be
present in data. Learning non-parametric invariances directly from data remains
an important open problem. In this paper, we introduce a new architectural
layer for convolutional networks which is capable of learning general
invariances from data itself. This layer can learn invariance to non-parametric
transformations and interestingly, motivates and incorporates permanent random
connectomes, thereby being called Permanent Random Connectome Non-Parametric
Transformation Networks (PRC-NPTN). PRC-NPTN networks are initialized with
random connections (not just weights) which are a small subset of the
connections in a fully connected convolution layer. Importantly, these
connections in PRC-NPTNs once initialized remain permanent throughout training
and testing. Permanent random connectomes make these architectures loosely more
biologically plausible than many other mainstream network architectures which
require highly ordered structures. We motivate randomly initialized connections
as a simple method to learn invariance from data itself while invoking
invariance towards multiple nuisance transformations simultaneously. We find
that these randomly initialized permanent connections have positive effects on
generalization, outperform much larger ConvNet baselines and the recently
proposed Non-Parametric Transformation Network (NPTN) on benchmarks that
enforce learning invariances from the data itself.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04112</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Continual learning models allow to learn and adapt to new changes and tasks
over time. However, in continual and sequential learning scenarios in which the
models are trained using different data with various distributions, neural
networks tend to forget the previously learned knowledge. This phenomenon is
often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. The catastrophic forgetting is an
inevitable problem in continual learning models for dynamic environments. To
address this issue, we propose a method, called Continual Bayesian Learning
Networks (CBLN), which enables the networks to allocate additional resources to
adapt to new tasks without forgetting the previously learned tasks. Using a
Bayesian Neural Network, CBLN maintains a mixture of Gaussian posterior
distributions that are associated with different tasks. The proposed method
tries to optimise the number of resources that are needed to learn each task
and avoids an exponential increase in the number of resources that are involved
in learning multiple tasks. The proposed method does not need to access the
past training data and can choose suitable weights to classify the data points
during the test time automatically based on an uncertainty criterion. We have
evaluated our method on the MNIST and UCR time-series datasets. The evaluation
results show that our method can address the catastrophic forgetting problem at
a promising rate compared to the state-of-the-art models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear interactions in the dendritic tree play a key role in neural
computation. Nevertheless, modeling frameworks aimed at the construction of
large-scale, functional spiking neural networks, such as the Neural Engineering
Framework, tend to assume a linear superposition of post-synaptic currents. In
this paper, we present a series of extensions to the Neural Engineering
Framework that facilitate the construction of networks incorporating Dale's
principle and nonlinear conductance-based synapses. We apply these extensions
to a two-compartment LIF neuron that can be seen as a simple model of passive
dendritic computation. We show that it is possible to incorporate neuron models
with input-dependent nonlinearities into the Neural Engineering Framework
without compromising high-level function and that nonlinear post-synaptic
currents can be systematically exploited to compute a wide variety of
multivariate, bandlimited functions, including the Euclidean norm, controlled
shunting, and non-negative multiplication. By avoiding an additional source of
spike noise, the function-approximation accuracy of a single layer of
two-compartment LIF neurons is on a par with or even surpasses that of
two-layer spiking neural networks up to a certain target function bandwidth.

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: General Distributed Neural Control and Sensory Adaptation for Self-Organized Locomotion and Fast Adaptation to Damage of Walking Robots</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00046</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Walking animals such as invertebrates can effectively perform self-organized and robust locomotion. They can also quickly adapt their gait to deal with injury or damage. Such a complex achievement is mainly performed via coordination between the legs, commonly known as interlimb coordination. Several components underlying the interlimb coordination process (like distributed neural control circuits, local sensory feedback, and body-environment interactions during movement) have been recently identified and applied to the control systems of walking robots. However, while the sensory pathways of biological systems are plastic and can be continuously readjusted (referred to as sensory adaptation), those implemented on robots are typically static. They first need to be manually adjusted or optimized offline to obtain stable locomotion. In this study, we introduce a fast learning mechanism for online sensory adaptation. It can continuously adjust the strength of sensory pathways, thereby introducing flexible plasticity into the connections between sensory feedback and neural control circuits. We combine the sensory adaptation mechanism with distributed neural control circuits to acquire the adaptive and robust interlimb coordination of walking robots. This novel approach is also general and flexible. It can automatically adapt to different walking robots and allow them to perform stable self-organized locomotion as well as quickly deal with damage within a few walking steps. The adaptation of plasticity after damage or injury is considered here as lesion-induced plasticity. We validated our adaptive interlimb coordination approach with continuous online sensory adaptation on simulated 4-, 6-, 8-, and 20-legged robots. This study not only proposes an adaptive neural control system for artificial walking systems but also offers a possibility of invertebrate nervous systems with flexible plasticity for locomotion and adaptation to injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: The Sec1/Munc18 protein Vps45 holds the Qa-SNARE Tlg2 in an open conformation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60724</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60724</link>
	<description>Fusion of intracellular trafficking vesicles is mediated by the assembly of SNARE proteins into membrane-bridging complexes. SNARE-mediated membrane fusion requires Sec1/Munc18-family (SM) proteins, SNARE chaperones that can function as templates to catalyze SNARE complex assembly. Paradoxically, the SM protein Munc18-1 traps the Qa-SNARE protein syntaxin-1 in an autoinhibited closed conformation. Here we present the structure of a second SM–Qa-SNARE complex, Vps45–Tlg2. Strikingly, Vps45 holds Tlg2 in an open conformation, with its SNARE motif disengaged from its Habc domain and its linker region unfolded. The domain 3a helical hairpin of Vps45 is unfurled, exposing the presumptive R-SNARE binding site to allow template complex formation. Although Tlg2 has a pronounced tendency to form homo-tetramers, Vps45 can rescue Tlg2 tetramers into stoichiometric Vps45–Tlg2 complexes. Our findings demonstrate that SM proteins can engage Qa-SNAREs using at least two different modes, one in which the SNARE is closed and one in which it is open.</description>

	<title>eLife: CMG helicase disassembly is controlled by replication fork DNA, replisome components and a ubiquitin threshold</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60371</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60371</link>
	<description>The eukaryotic replisome assembles around the CMG helicase, which stably associates with DNA replication forks throughout elongation. When replication terminates, CMG is ubiquitylated on its Mcm7 subunit and disassembled by the Cdc48 / p97 ATPase. Until now, the regulation that restricts CMG ubiquitylation to termination was unknown, as was the mechanism of disassembly. By reconstituting these processes with purified budding yeast proteins, we show that ubiquitylation is tightly repressed throughout elongation by the Y-shaped DNA structure of replication forks. Termination removes the repressive DNA structure, whereupon long K48-linked ubiquitin chains are conjugated to CMG-Mcm7, dependent on multiple replisome components that bind to the ubiquitin ligase SCF&lt;sup&gt;Dia2&lt;/sup&gt;. This mechanism pushes CMG beyond a '5-ubiquitin threshold' that is inherent to Cdc48, which specifically unfolds ubiquitylated Mcm7 and thereby disassembles CMG. These findings explain the exquisite regulation of CMG disassembly and provide a general model for the disassembly of ubiquitylated protein complexes by Cdc48.</description>

	<description>Molecular-glue degraders mediate interactions between target proteins and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause selective protein degradation. Here, we report a new molecular glue HQ461 discovered by high-throughput screening. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic screening in human cancer cells followed by biochemical reconstitution, we show that HQ461 acts by promoting an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK12-interacting protein Cyclin K (CCNK). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 compromised CDK12 function, leading to reduced phosphorylation of a CDK12 substrate, downregulation of DNA damage response genes, and cell death. Structure-activity relationship analysis of HQ461 revealed the importance of a 5-methylthiazol-2-amine pharmacophore and resulted in an HQ461 derivate with improved potency. Our studies reveal a new molecular glue that recruits its target protein directly to DDB1 to bypass the requirement of a substrate-specific receptor, presenting a new strategy for targeted protein degradation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Shadow enhancers can suppress input transcription factor noise through distinct regulatory logic</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59351</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59351</link>
	<description>Shadow enhancers, groups of seemingly redundant enhancers, are found in a wide range of organisms and are critical for robust developmental patterning. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor (TF) inputs at the individual enhancers. By measuring transcriptional dynamics of several &lt;i&gt;Kruppel&lt;/i&gt; shadow enhancer configurations in live &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos, we showed individual member enhancers act largely independently. We found that TF fluctuations are an appreciable source of noise that the shadow enhancer pair can better buffer than duplicated enhancers. The shadow enhancer pair is uniquely able to maintain low levels of expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. A stochastic model demonstrated the separation of TF inputs is sufficient to explain these findings. Our results suggest the widespread use of shadow enhancers is partially due to their noise suppressing ability.</description>

	<title>eLife: Inference from longitudinal laboratory tests characterizes temporal evolution of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC)</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59209</link>
	<description>Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and triangulation with clinical outcomes extracted from unstructured EHR provider notes is integral to advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 246 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive (COVID&lt;sub&gt;pos&lt;/sub&gt;)patients and propensity-matched 2,460 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative (COVID&lt;sub&gt;neg&lt;/sub&gt;) patients subjected to around 700,000 lab tests cumulatively across 194 assays. Compared to COVID&lt;sub&gt;neg&lt;/sub&gt; patients at the time of diagnostic testing, COVID&lt;sub&gt;pos&lt;/sub&gt; patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and lower platelet counts. However, as the infection evolves, COVID&lt;sub&gt;pos&lt;/sub&gt; patients distinctively show declining fibrinogen, increasing platelet counts, and lower white blood cell counts. Augmented curation of EHRs suggests that only a minority of COVID&lt;sub&gt;pos&lt;/sub&gt; patients develop thromboembolism, and rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with patients generally not displaying platelet reductions typical of consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends provide fine-grained resolution into COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) and set the stage for personalizing thromboprophylaxis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Global alignment and assessment of TRP channel transmembrane domain structures to explore functional mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58660</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58660</link>
	<description>The recent proliferation of published TRP channel structures provides a foundation for understanding the diverse functional properties of this important family of ion channel proteins. To facilitate mechanistic investigations, we constructed a structure-based alignment of the transmembrane domains of 120 TRP channel structures. Comparison of structures determined in the absence or presence of activating stimuli reveals similar constrictions in the central ion permeation pathway near the intracellular end of the S6 helices, pointing to a conserved cytoplasmic gate and suggesting that most available structures represent non-conducting states. Comparison of the ion selectivity filters toward the extracellular end of the pore supports existing hypotheses for mechanisms of ion selectivity. Also conserved to varying extents are hot spots for interactions with hydrophobic ligands, lipids and ions, as well as discrete alterations in helix conformations. This analysis therefore provides a framework for investigating the structural basis of TRP channel gating mechanisms and pharmacology, and, despite the large number of structures included, reveals the need for additional structural data and for more functional studies to establish the mechanistic basis of TRP channel function.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis coordinates oxidative metabolism in mammalian mitochondria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58041</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58041</link>
	<description>Cells harbor two systems for fatty acid synthesis, one in the cytoplasm (catalyzed by fatty acid synthase, FASN) and one in the mitochondria (mtFAS). In contrast to FASN, mtFAS is poorly characterized, especially in higher eukaryotes, with the major product(s), metabolic roles, and cellular function(s) being essentially unknown. Here we show that hypomorphic mtFAS mutant mouse skeletal myoblast cell lines display a severe loss of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and exhibit compensatory metabolic activities including reductive carboxylation. This effect on ETC complexes appears to be independent of protein lipoylation, the best characterized function of mtFAS, as mutants lacking lipoylation have an intact ETC. Finally, mtFAS impairment blocks the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Together, these data suggest that ETC activity in mammals is profoundly controlled by mtFAS function, thereby connecting anabolic fatty acid synthesis with the oxidation of carbon fuels.</description>

	<description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious global health concern, many individuals live with TBI-related neurological dysfunction. A lack of biomarkers of TBI has impeded medication development. To identify new potential biomarkers, we time-dependently evaluated mouse brain tissue and neuronally derived plasma extracellular vesicles proteins in a mild model of TBI with parallels to concussive head injury. Mice (CD-1, 30–40 g) received a sham procedure or 30 g weight-drop, and were euthanized 8, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours, 7, 14 and 30 days later. We quantified ipsilateral cortical proteins. Many of them differed from 8 hours onwards post mTBI compared to sham, 23 proteins changed in 4 or more of 8 different time points. Gene ontology pathways mapped from altered proteins over time related to pathological and physiological processes. Further validation of proteins identified in this study may provide utility as treatment response biomarkers.</description>

	<description>Perturbation of addition of second heart field (SHF) cardiac progenitor cells to the poles of the heart tube results in congenital heart defects (CHD). The transcriptional programs and upstream regulatory events operating in different subpopulations of the SHF remain unclear. Here, we profile the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of anterior and posterior SHF sub-populations at genome-wide levels and demonstrate that Hoxb1 negatively regulates differentiation in the posterior SHF. Spatial mis-expression of &lt;i&gt;Hoxb1&lt;/i&gt; in the anterior SHF results in hypoplastic right ventricle. Activation of &lt;i&gt;Hoxb1&lt;/i&gt; in embryonic stem cells arrests cardiac differentiation, whereas &lt;i&gt;Hoxb1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mouse embryos display premature cardiac differentiation. Moreover, ectopic differentiation in the posterior SHF of embryos lacking both &lt;i&gt;Hoxb1&lt;/i&gt; and its paralog &lt;i&gt;Hoxa1&lt;/i&gt; results in atrioventricular septal defects. Our results show that Hoxb1 plays a key role in patterning cardiac progenitor cells that contribute to both cardiac poles and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CHD.</description>

	<title>eLife: Antagonistic control of C. elegans germline stem cell proliferation and differentiation by PUF proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2</title>

	<description>Stem cells support tissue maintenance, but the mechanisms that coordinate the rate of stem cell self-renewal with differentiation at a population level remain uncharacterized. We find that two PUF family RNA-binding proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 have opposite effects on &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; germline stem cell dynamics: FBF-1 restricts the rate of meiotic entry, while FBF-2 promotes both cell division and meiotic entry rates. Antagonistic effects of FBFs are mediated by their distinct activities towards the shared set of target mRNAs, where FBF-1-mediated post-transcriptional control requires the activity of CCR4-NOT deadenylase, while FBF-2 is deadenylase-independent and might protect the targets from deadenylation. These regulatory differences depend on protein sequences outside of the conserved PUF family RNA-binding domain. We propose that the opposing FBF-1 and FBF-2 activities serve to modulate stem cell division rate simultaneously with the rate of meiotic entry.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sex mediates relationships between regional tau pathology and cognitive decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were 343 clinically‐normal individuals (Female,58%; 73.8[8.5] years) and 55 individuals with MCI (Female,38%; 76.9[7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐PET signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET(+/‐) and sex*APOEε4 status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females showed significantly higher FTP‐signal than males across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (p&amp;lt;0.007). Aβ‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (p&amp;lt;0.007); Aβ+ females exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Females with higher FTP‐signal in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than males (p=0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau vulnerability in females is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in females with the onset of clinical symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Remote Blood Biomarkers of Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in a Population Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of blood biomarkers of total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic AD and cognitive decline are not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and undergone 1.5T structural MRI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD, especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8–16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4–8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years: baseline t‐tau above 0.40 pg/mL had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L above 25.5 pg/mL had 110% faster decline, and GFAP above 232 pg/mL had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP above 232 pg/mL showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those below 160 pg/mL. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in third ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s dementia&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Central nervous system‐infiltrated immune cells induce calcium increase in astrocytes via astroglial purinergic signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3ca61cca-a627-44af-bb60-1bd51977cf31/jnr24699-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of the central nervous system (CNS)‐infiltrated immune cells induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cultured naïve astrocytes through glial purinergic receptor‐mediated signaling. This provides an insight into the astroglial response to the immune cells in their local environment in CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction between autoreactive immune cells and astroglia is an important part of the pathologic processes that fuel neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. In this inflammatory disease, immune cells enter into the central nervous system (CNS) and they spread through CNS parenchyma, but the impact of these autoreactive immune cells on the activity pattern of astrocytes has not been defined. By exploiting naïve astrocytes in culture and CNS‐infiltrated immune cells (CNS IICs) isolated from rat with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), here we demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of immune cell–astrocyte interaction. We show that CNS IICs but not the peripheral immune cell application, evokes a rapid and vigorous intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase in astrocytes by promoting glial release of ATP. ATP propagated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation through glial purinergic P2X7 receptor activation by the hemichannel‐dependent nucleotide release mechanism. Astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase is specifically triggered by the autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell application and these two cell types exhibit close spatial interaction in EAE. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals may mediate a rapid astroglial response to the autoreactive immune cells in their local environment. This property of immune cell–astrocyte interaction may be important to consider in studies interrogating CNS autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A model of uniform cortical composition predicts the scaling laws of the mammalian cerebrum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.16.252825v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.16.252825v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The size of the mammalian cerebrum spans more than 5 orders of magnitude. The cortical surface gets increasingly folded and the proportion of white-to-gray matter volume increases with the total volume. These scaling relations have unusually little variation. Here, we develop a new theory of homogeneous composition of the cortex across mammals, validated with three simple numerical models. An extended tension model combined with a fractal-like growth rule, explains the pattern of gyri and sulci, as well as the arrangement of primary and secondary areas on the cortex. The second model predicts the white matter volume. The third model predicts the cortical surface area from the gray and white matter volume. All models have an r2 &amp;gt; 0.995. Further, the last model accurately predicts the intraspecific variation for humans. Except for cetaceans, no clades show systematic deviations from the models, providing evidence that the regular architecture of the cortex shapes the cerebrum.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Multiple regions of primate orofacial sensorimotor cortex encode bite force and gape</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.16.252817v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.16.252817v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The precise control of bite force and gape is vital for effective breakdown and manipulation of food inside the oral cavity during feeding. Yet the role of the orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMcx) in the control of bite force and gape is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate how individual neurons and populations of neurons in multiple regions of OSMcx differentially encode bite force and gape when subjects (Macaca mulatta) generated different levels of bite force at varying gapes. We examined neuronal activity recorded simultaneously from three microelectrode arrays implanted chronically in the primary motor (MIo), primary somatosensory (SIo), and cortical masticatory (CMA) areas of OSMcx. We used generalized linear models to evaluate encoding properties of individual neurons and utilized dimensionality reduction techniques to decompose population activity into components related to specific task parameters. Individual neurons encoded bite force more strongly than gape in all three OSMCx areas although bite force was a better predictor of spiking activity in MIo versus SIo. Population activity differentiated between levels of bite force and gape while preserving task-independent temporal modulation across the behavioral trial. While activation patterns of neuronal populations were comparable across OSMCx areas, the total variance explained by task parameters was context-dependent and differed across areas. These findings suggest that the cortical control of gape may rely on computations at the population level whereas the strong encoding of bite force at the individual neuron level allows for the precise and rapid control of bite force.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), a subset of chronic active white matter lesions are identifiable on MRI by their paramagnetic rims, and increasing evidence supports their association with clinical disease severity. Here we study their potential role in differential diagnosis, screening an international multicenter clinical research‐based sample of 438 individuals affected by different neurological conditions (MS, other inflammatory, infectious, and non‐inflammatory). Paramagnetic rim lesion detection, rarely occurring in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS. Future prospective multicenter studies should further validate its role as a diagnostic biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of the African wild dog. II. The olfactory system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad1ac5ac-5f7f-480c-a16e-42dab1a4cf69/cne25007-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follow that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioural responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hearing loss in Alzheimer Disease is associated with altered serum lipidomic biomarker profiles</title>

	<description>Recent data have found that aging-related hearing loss (ARHL) is associated with the development of Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, the nature of the relationship between these two disorders is not clear. There are multiple potential factors that link ARHL and AD, and previous groups have speculated that common metabolic dysregulation may underlie the propensity to develop both disorders. Here, we investigate the distribution of serum lipidomic biomarkers in AD subjects with or without hearing loss in a publicly available dataset. Serum levels of 349 known lipids from 16 lipid classes were measured in 185 AD patients. Using previously defined co-regulated sets of lipids, both age- and sex-adjusted, we found that lipid sets enriched in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine showed a strong association with hearing loss. Examination of biochemical classes confirmed these relationships and found that serum phosphatidylcholine levels were significantly lower in AD subjects with hearing loss. A similar relationship was not found in normal subjects. These data suggest that a synergistic relationship may exist between AD, hearing loss and metabolic biomarkers, such that in the context of a pathological state such as AD, alterations in serum metabolic profiles are also shared with hearing loss hearing loss. These data also point to a potential role for phosphatidylcholine, a molecule with antioxidant properties, in the underlying pathophysiology of ARHL in the context of AD, which has implications for our understanding and potential treatment of both disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparative morphology of the corpus callosum across the adult lifespan in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans</title>

	<description>The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross-sectional study, we address this question by comparing age-related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1-weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large-scale human samples which was age-range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: n = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; n = 664). Using generalized additive modelling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared to the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans, is not an universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human-specific.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dendritic spikes in apical oblique dendrites of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons</title>

	<description>Dendritic spikes in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) play a major role in cortical computation. While dendritic spikes have been studied extensively in apical and basal dendrites of L5PNs, whether oblique dendrites, which ramify in the input layers of the cortex, also generate dendritic spikes is unknown. Here we report the existence of dendritic spikes in apical oblique dendrites of L5PNs. In silico investigations indicate that oblique branch spikes are triggered by brief, low-frequency action potential (AP) trains (~40 Hz) and are characterized by a fast sodium spike followed by activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. In vitro experiments confirmed the existence of oblique branch spikes in L5PNs during brief AP trains at frequencies of around 60 Hz. Oblique branch spikes offer new insights into branch-specific computation in L5PNs and may be critical for sensory processing in the input layers of the cortex.</description>

	<description>Quickly and slowly mobilized reserve vesicles within presynaptic terminals are thought to be contained within separate pools that are connected in series. However, here we use FM-dyes to show that the two types are mobilized in parallel, without intermixing. The result supports a re-conceptualization of synaptic vesicle trafficking, proposed previously, where: (1) active zones contain multiple independent docking/release sites; (2) the release sites vary in probability of catalyzing exocytosis following individual action potentials; and (3), each docked vesicle is connected to a separate reserve. The re-conceptualization is then supported further by evidence that alterations in the timing of reserve pool depletion in synapsin knockouts are largest during lightest use even though alterations in short-term synaptic plasticity are largest during heavy use. The re-conceptualization implies that low release probability sites account for both reluctant readily releasable vesicles and slowly mobilized reserves. Extensive heterogeneity suggests that synapses have the capacity to store information by modulating the ratio of low to high probability release sites.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Whole-brain mapping of monosynaptic inputs to midbrain cholinergic neurons</title>

	<description>The cholinergic midbrain is involved in a wide range of motor and cognitive processes. Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) send long-ranging axonal projections that target sensorimotor and limbic areas in the thalamus, the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatal complex following a topographical gradient, where they influence a range of functions including attention, reinforcement learning and action-selection. Nevertheless, a comprehensive examination of the afferents to PPN and LDT cholinergic neurons is still lacking, partly due to the neurochemical heterogeneity of this region. Here we characterize the whole-brain input connectome to cholinergic neurons across distinct functional domains (i.e. PPN vs LDT) using conditional transsynaptic retrograde labeling in ChAT::Cre male and female rats. The quantification of input neurons revealed that both PPN and LDT receive similar substantial inputs from the superior colliculus and the output of the basal ganglia (i.e. substantia nigra pars reticulata). In addition, we found that PPN cholinergic neurons receive preferential inputs from basal ganglia structures than from the cortex, whereas LDT cholinergic neurons receive preferential inputs from cortical areas. Our results provide the first characterization of inputs to PPN and LDT cholinergic neurons. The differences in afferents to each cholinergic structure support their differential roles in behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Synaptic anchoring of the endoplasmic reticulum depends on myosin V and caldendrin activity</title>

	<description>Excitatory synapses of principal hippocampal neurons are frequently located on dendritic spines. The dynamic strengthening or weakening of individual inputs results in a great structural and molecular diversity of dendritic spines. Active spines with large Ca2+ transients are frequently invaded by a single protrusion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is dynamically transported into and out of spines by the actin-based motor myosin V. An increase in synaptic strength often correlates with stable anchoring of the ER, followed by the formation of the spine apparatus organelle. Here we show that synaptic ER stabilization depends on the interplay of two Ca2+-binding proteins: calmodulin serves as a light chain of myosin V and activates the motor function, whereas caldendrin acts as an inhibitor which transforms myosin into a stationary F-actin tether. Together, they provide a Ca2+-sensing module for fine-tuning myosin V activity and thereby regulate the formation of the spine apparatus in a subset of active dendritic spines.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Detection of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Using Machine Learning Classification of Resting-State Functional Network Connectivity Data</title>

	<description>Introduction: Previous work utilizing resting state fMRI to measure functional network connectivity in rodents with moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) revealed several sex- and region-dependent alterations in FNC implicating FNC as potential biomarker for PAE. Given that FNC is sensitive to neurological and psychiatric conditions in humans, here, we explore the use of previously acquired FNC data and machine learning methods to detect PAE among a sample of rodents exposed to moderate PAE and controls exposed to a saccharin solution. Materials &amp;amp; Methods: We utilized previously acquired fMRI data from 48 adult rats, 24 PAE (12 male 12 female) and 24 saccharin exposed (SAC) controls (12 male and 12 female) for classification. The entire data sample was utilized to perform binary classification (SAC or PAE) of FNC data with multiple support vector machine (SVM) kernels and out-of-sample cross-validation to evaluate classification performance. Results: Results revealed accuracy rates of 62.5% for all samples, 58.3% for males, and 79.2% for females using a quadratic SVM kernel to classify moderate PAE from FNC data. In addition, brain networks localized to hippocampal and cortical regions contributed strongly to QSVM classifications. Conclusion: Our results suggest overall modest classification performance of a QSVM to detect moderate PAE from FNC data gathered from adult rats, yet good performance among females. Further developments and refinement of the technique hold promise for the detection of PAE in earlier developmental time periods that potentially offer additional tools for the non-invasive detection of PAE from FNC data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sub-optimal Discontinuous Current-Clamp switching rates lead to deceptive mouse neuronal firing</title>

	<description>Intracellular recordings using sharp micro-electrodes often rely on a technique called Discontinuous Current-Clamp to accurately record the membrane potential while injecting current through the same micro-electrode. It is well known that a poor choice of DCC switching rate can lead to under- or over-estimation of the cell potential, however, its effect on the cell firing is rarely discussed. Here, we show that sub-optimal switching rates lead to an overestimation of the cell excitability. We performed intracellular recordings of mouse spinal motoneurons, and recorded their firing in response to pulses and ramps of current in bridge and DCC mode at various switching rates. We demonstrate that using an incorrect (too low) DCC frequency lead not only to an overestimation of the cell conductance, but also, paradoxically, to an artificial overestimation the firing of these cells: neurons fire at lower current, and at higher frequencies than at higher DCC rates, or than the same neuron recorded in Bridge mode. These effects are dependent on the membrane time constant of the recorded cell, and special care needs to be taken in large cells with very short time constants. Our work highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate DCC switching rate to obtain not only accurate membrane potential readings, but also accurate representation of the firing of the cell.</description>

Vector control has been a key component in the fight against malaria for decades, and chemical insecticides are critical to the success of vector control programs worldwide. However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bTY4nEQilzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the last decade, there has been tremendous progress in identifying genetic anomalies linked to clinical disease. New experimental platforms have connected genetic variants to mechanisms underlying disruption of cellular and organ behavior and the emergence of proarrhythmic cardiac phenotypes. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) signifies an important advance in the study of genetic disease in a patient-specific context. However, considerable limitations of iPSC-CM technologies have not been addressed: 1) phenotypic variability in apparently identical genotype perturbations, 2) low-throughput electrophysiological measurements, and 3) an immature phenotype which may impact translation to adult cardiac response. We have developed a computational approach intended to address these problems. We applied our recent iPSC-CM computational model to predict the proarrhythmic risk of 40 KCNQ1 genetic variants. An I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; computational model was fit to experimental data for each mutation, and the impact of each mutation was simulated in a population of iPSC-CM models. Using a test set of 15 KCNQ1 mutations with known clinical long QT phenotypes, we developed a method to stratify the effects of KCNQ1 mutations based on proarrhythmic markers. We utilized this method to predict the severity of the remaining 25 KCNQ1 mutations with unknown clinical significance. Tremendous phenotypic variability was observed in the iPSC-CM model population following mutant perturbations. A key novelty is our reporting of the impact of individual KCNQ1 mutant models on adult ventricular cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, allowing for prediction of mutant impact across the continuum of aging. This serves as a first step toward translating predicted response in the iPSC-CM model to predicted response of the adult ventricular myocyte given the same genetic mutation. As a whole, this study presents a new computational framework that serves as a high throughput method to evaluate risk of genetic mutations based-on proarrhythmic behavior in phenotypically variable populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cDA4WPN2SKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Antibiotic resistance is rising and we urgently need to gain a better quantitative understanding of how antibiotics act, which in turn would also speed up the development of new antibiotics. Here, we describe a computational model (COMBAT-COmputational Model of Bacterial Antibiotic Target-binding) that can quantitatively predict antibiotic dose-response relationships. Our goal is dual: We address a fundamental biological question and investigate how drug-target binding shapes antibiotic action. We also create a tool that can predict antibiotic efficacy a priori. COMBAT requires measurable biochemical parameters of drug-target interaction and can be directly fitted to time-kill curves. As a proof-of-concept, we first investigate the utility of COMBAT with antibiotics belonging to the widely used quinolone class. COMBAT can predict antibiotic efficacy in clinical isolates for quinolones from drug affinity (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;0.9). To further challenge our approach, we also do the reverse: estimate the magnitude of changes in drug-target binding based on antibiotic dose-response curves. We overexpress target molecules to infer changes in antibiotic-target binding from changes in antimicrobial efficacy of ciprofloxacin with 92–94% accuracy. To test the generality of our approach, we use the beta-lactam ampicillin to predict target molecule occupancy at MIC from antimicrobial action with 90% accuracy. Finally, we apply COMBAT to predict antibiotic concentrations that can select for resistance due to novel resistance mutations. Using ciprofloxacin and ampicillin as well defined test cases, our work demonstrates that drug-target binding is a major predictor of bacterial responses to antibiotics. This is surprising because antibiotic action involves many additional effects downstream of drug-target binding. In addition, COMBAT provides a framework to inform optimal antibiotic dose levels that maximize efficacy and minimize the rise of resistant mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RlDIbe95eSM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Inference of admixture proportions is a classical statistical problem in population genetics. Standard methods implicitly assume that both parents of an individual have the same admixture fraction. However, this is rarely the case in real data. In this paper we show that the distribution of admixture tract lengths in a genome contains information about the admixture proportions of the ancestors of an individual. We develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework for estimating the admixture proportions of the immediate ancestors of an individual, i.e. a type of decomposition of an individual’s admixture proportions into further subsets of ancestral proportions in the ancestors. Based on a genealogical model for admixture tracts, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the sampling probability of the genome from a single individual, as a function of the admixture proportions of the ancestors of this individual. This allows us to perform probabilistic inference of admixture proportions of ancestors only using the genome of an extant individual. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the error in the estimation of ancestral admixture proportions under various conditions. To illustrate the utility of the method, we apply it to real genetic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QimDbNlEa14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genetic studies have recently highlighted the importance of fat distribution, as well as overall adiposity, in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases. Using a large study (n = 1,288) from 4 independent cohorts, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mean adipocyte area and obesity-related traits, and identify genetic factors associated with adipocyte cell size. To perform the first large-scale study of automatic adipocyte phenotyping using both histological and genetic data, we developed a deep learning-based method, the Adipocyte U-Net, to rapidly derive mean adipocyte area estimates from histology images. We validate our method using three state-of-the-art approaches; CellProfiler, Adiposoft and floating adipocytes fractions, all run blindly on two external cohorts. We observe high concordance between our method and the state-of-the-art approaches (Adipocyte U-net vs. CellProfiler: &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;visceral&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.94, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;subcutaneous&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.91, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;), and faster run times (10,000 images: 6mins vs 3.5hrs). We applied the Adipocyte U-Net to 4 cohorts with histology, genetic, and phenotypic data (total N = 820). After meta-analysis, we found that mean adipocyte area positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;subq&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.13 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−69&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;subq&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;visc&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−55&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;visc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.49; average &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; across cohorts = 0.49) and that adipocytes in subcutaneous depots are larger than their visceral counterparts (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;meta&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;). Lastly, we performed the largest GWAS and subsequent meta-analysis of mean adipocyte area and intra-individual adipocyte variation (N = 820). Despite having twice the number of samples than any similar study, we found no genome-wide significant associations, suggesting that larger sample sizes and a homogenous collection of adipose tissue are likely needed to identify robust genetic associations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2gUxo07LOqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The dynamic signal encoding paradigm suggests that information flows from the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns (encoding) that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work empirically quantified the information content of dynamic signaling patterns. However, whether this information can be faithfully transmitted to the gene expression level is unclear. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of information transmission from signaling dynamics into gene expression. Using a detailed mathematical model, we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allows us to determine information loss in transmission between receptors to dynamic signaling patterns and between signaling dynamics to gene expression. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to a lack of specificity. We found that noise-free gene expression has very little information loss suggesting that gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, the addition of noise to the gene expression model results in information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during gene expression. Overall our results show that the cellular capacity for information transmission from dynamic signaling patterns to gene expression can be high enough to preserve ligand specificity and thereby the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wDtY4jRy0Sw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

New treatments for diseases caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms can be developed by identifying unexplored therapeutic targets and by designing efficient drug screening protocols. In this study, we have screened a library of compounds to find ligands for the flavin-adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS) -a potential target for drug design against tuberculosis and pneumonia- by implementing a new and efficient virtual screening protocol. The protocol has been developed for the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; search of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets, for which limited information about ligands or ligand-receptor structures is available. It implements an integrative funnel-like strategy with filtering layers that increase in computational accuracy. The protocol starts with a pharmacophore-based virtual screening strategy that uses ligand-free receptor conformations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, it performs a molecular docking stage using several docking programs and an exponential consensus ranking strategy. The last filter, samples the conformations of compounds bound to the target using MD simulations. The MD conformations are scored using several traditional scoring functions in combination with a newly-proposed score that takes into account the fluctuations of the molecule with a Morse-based potential. The protocol was optimized and validated using a compound library with known ligands of the &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterium ammoniagenes&lt;/i&gt; FADS. Then, it was used to find new FADS ligands from a compound library of 14,000 molecules. A small set of 17 &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; filtered molecules were tested experimentally. We identified five inhibitors of the activity of the flavin adenylyl transferase module of the FADS, and some of them were able to inhibit growth of three bacterial species: &lt;i&gt;C. ammoniagenes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, where the two are human pathogens. Overall, the results show that the integrative VS protocol is a cost-effective solution for the discovery of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ysLfvTPFjIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence in pathogenic bacteria underlies a major public health issue. Understanding how, in the absence of antibiotic-mediated selection, plasmid-bearing cells avoid being outnumbered by plasmid-free cells is key to developing counterstrategies. Here, we quantified the induction of the plasmidial sex pheromone pathway of &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; to show that the integration of the stimulatory (mate-sensing) and inhibitory (self-sensing) signaling modules from the pCF10 conjugative plasmid provides a precise measure of the recipient-to-donor ratio, agnostic to variations in population size. Such ratiometric control of conjugation favors vertical plasmid transfer under low mating likelihood and allows activation of conjugation functions only under high mating likelihood. We further show that this strategy constitutes a cost-effective investment into mating effort because overstimulation produces unproductive self-aggregation and growth rate reduction. A mathematical model suggests that ratiometric control of conjugation increases plasmid fitness and predicts a robust long-term, stable coexistence of donors and recipients. Our results demonstrate how population-level parameters can control transfer of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, opening the door for biotic control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RVMc99MAxj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Is Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder a Risk Factor for Impulse Control Disorder in Parkinson Disease?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25798?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25798?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other determinants and incident impulse control disorder behaviors (ICBs) in patients with early Parkinson disease (PD) using longitudinal data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hundred one newly diagnosed PD patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline (BL), month 6, and annually for 5 years. Probable RBD (pRBD) was assessed with the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and dichotomized using a cutoff value of ≥6. The association of BL and time‐dependent (TD) pRBD and other covariates with the development of ICB symptoms was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and general estimating equation logistic regression. Models considered adjustment for age, sex, Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS‐15), RBD medication use, total levodopa equivalent daily dose, and dopamine agonist (DA) and antidepressant medication use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both BL pRBD and TD pRBD were not associated with an increased risk for incident ICB symptoms after adjustment for covariates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.458 and HR = 1.27, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.257, respectively). In a modified TD pRBD model (ie, considering subjects as pRBD onward from the first time point with RBDSQ score ≥ 6), the risk for incident ICB symptoms was higher in pRBD in unadjusted (HR = 1.48, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038) but not adjusted (HR = 1.29, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.203) models. TD DA use (HR = 1.64, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.039), TD GDS‐15 score (HR = 1.12, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and male sex (year 3: HR = 2.10, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009; year 4: HR = 3.04, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; year 5: HR = 4.40, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) were associated with increased ICB symptom risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pRBD is not clearly associated with ICB symptom development in early PD, in contrast to DA use, depression, and male sex. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art speaker verification models are based on deep learning
techniques, which heavily depend on the handdesigned neural architectures from
experts or engineers. We borrow the idea of neural architecture search(NAS) for
the textindependent speaker verification task. As NAS can learn deep network
structures automatically, we introduce the NAS conception into the well-known
x-vector network. Furthermore, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm
enhanced neural architecture search method called Auto-Vector to automatically
discover promising networks for the speaker verification task. The experimental
results demonstrate our NAS-based model outperforms state-of-the-art speaker
verification models.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Neurodegenerative damage reduces firing coherence in a continuous attractor model of grid cells. (arXiv:2008.05591v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05591</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in the dorsolateral band of the medial entorhinal cortex(dMEC)
display strikingly regular periodic firing patterns on a lattice of positions
in 2-D space. This helps animals to encode relative spatial location without
reference to external cues. The dMEC is damaged in the early stages of
Alzheimer's Disease, which affects navigation ability of a disease victim,
reducing the synaptic density of neurons in the network. Within an established
2-dimensional continuous attractor neural network model of grid cell activity,
we introduce damage parameterized by radius and by the strength of the synaptic
output for neurons in the damaged region. The proportionality of the grid field
flow on the dMEX to the velocity of the model organism is maintained, but when
we examine the coherence of the grid cell firing field in the form of the
Fourier transform (Bragg peaks) of the grid lattice, we find that a wide range
of damage radius and strength induces an incoherent structure with only a
single central peak, adjacent to narrow bands of striped (two additional
peaks), which abut an orthorhombic pattern (four additional peaks), that abuts
the undamaged hexagonal region (six additional peaks). Within the damaged
region, grid cells show no Bragg peaks, and outside the damaged region the
central Bragg peak strength is largely unaffected. There is a re-entrant region
of normal grid firing for very large damage area. We anticipate that the
modified grid cell behavior can be observed in non-invasive fMRI imaging of the
dMEC.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The machinery of the human brain -- analog, probabilistic, embodied -- can be
characterized computationally, but what machinery confers what computational
powers? Any such system can be abstractly cast in terms of two computational
components: a finite state machine carrying out computational steps, whether
via currents, chemistry, or mechanics; plus a set of allowable memory
operations, typically formulated in terms of an information store that can be
read from and written to, whether via synaptic change, state transition, or
recurrent activity. Probing these mechanisms for their information content, we
can capture the difference in computational power that various systems are
capable of. Most human cognitive abilities, from perception to action to
memory, are shared with other species; we seek to characterize those (few)
capabilities that are ubiquitously present among humans and absent from other
species. Three realms of formidable constraints -- a) measurable human
cognitive abilities, b) measurable allometric anatomic brain characteristics,
and c) measurable features of specific automata and formal grammars --
illustrate remarkably sharp restrictions on human abilities, unexpectedly
confining human cognition to a specific class of automata (&quot;nested stack&quot;),
which are markedly below Turing machines.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Comprehensive forecasting based analysis using stacked stateless and stateful Gated Recurrent Unit models. (arXiv:2008.05575v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photovoltaic power is a renewable source of energy which is highly used in
industries. In economically struggling countries it can be a potential source
of electric energy as other non-renewable resources are already exhausting. Now
if installation of a photovoltaic cell in a region is done prior to research,
it may not provide the desired energy output required for running that region.
Hence forecasting is required which can elicit the output from a particular
region considering its geometrical coordinates, solar parameter like GHI and
weather parameters like temperature and wind speed etc. Our paper explores
forecasting of solar irradiance on four such regions, out of which three is in
West Bengal and one outside to depict with using stacked Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) models. We have checked that stateful stacked gated recurrent unit model
improves the prediction accuracy significantly.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep reinforcement learning is a promising approach to training a dialog
manager, but current methods struggle with the large state and action spaces of
multi-domain dialog systems. Building upon Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations
(DQfD), an algorithm that scores highly in difficult Atari games, we leverage
dialog data to guide the agent to successfully respond to a user's requests. We
make progressively fewer assumptions about the data needed, using labeled,
reduced-labeled, and even unlabeled data to train expert demonstrators. We
introduce Reinforced Fine-tune Learning, an extension to DQfD, enabling us to
overcome the domain gap between the datasets and the environment. Experiments
in a challenging multi-domain dialog system framework validate our approaches,
and get high success rates even when trained on out-of-domain data.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep k-NN Defense against Clean-label Data Poisoning Attacks. (arXiv:1909.13374v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13374</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13374</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Targeted clean-label data poisoning is a type of adversarial attack on
machine learning systems in which an adversary injects a few correctly-labeled,
minimally-perturbed samples into the training data, causing a model to
misclassify a particular test sample during inference. Although defenses have
been proposed for general poisoning attacks, no reliable defense for
clean-label attacks has been demonstrated, despite the attacks' effectiveness
and realistic applications. In this work, we propose a simple, yet
highly-effective Deep k-NN defense against both feature collision and convex
polytope clean-label attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We demonstrate that our
proposed strategy is able to detect over 99% of poisoned examples in both
attacks and remove them without compromising model performance. Additionally,
through ablation studies, we discover simple guidelines for selecting the value
of k as well as for implementing the Deep k-NN defense on real-world datasets
with class imbalance. Our proposed defense shows that current clean-label
poisoning attack strategies can be annulled, and serves as a strong yet
simple-to-implement baseline defense to test future clean-label poisoning
attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/neeharperi/DeepKNNDefense

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Mish: A Self Regularized Non-Monotonic Activation Function. (arXiv:1908.08681v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08681</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08681</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose $\textit{Mish}$, a novel self-regularized non-monotonic activation
function which can be mathematically defined as: $f(x)=x\tanh(softplus(x))$. As
activation functions play a crucial role in the performance and training
dynamics in neural networks, we validated experimentally on several well-known
benchmarks against the best combinations of architectures and activation
functions. We also observe that data augmentation techniques have a favorable
effect on benchmarks like ImageNet-1k and MS-COCO across multiple
architectures. For example, Mish outperformed Leaky ReLU on YOLOv4 with a
CSP-DarkNet-53 backbone on average precision ($AP_{50}^{val}$) by 2.1$\%$ in
MS-COCO object detection and ReLU on ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k in Top-1 accuracy
by $\approx$1$\%$ while keeping all other network parameters and
hyperparameters constant. Furthermore, we explore the mathematical formulation
of Mish in relation with the Swish family of functions and propose an intuitive
understanding on how the first derivative behavior may be acting as a
regularizer helping the optimization of deep neural networks. Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/digantamisra98/Mish.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Run-Time Efficient RNN Compression for Inference on Edge Devices. (arXiv:1906.04886v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04886</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04886</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks can be large and compute-intensive, yet many
applications that benefit from RNNs run on small devices with very limited
compute and storage capabilities while still having run-time constraints. As a
result, there is a need for compression techniques that can achieve significant
compression without negatively impacting inference run-time and task accuracy.
This paper explores a new compressed RNN cell implementation called Hybrid
Matrix Decomposition (HMD) that achieves this dual objective. This scheme
divides the weight matrix into two parts - an unconstrained upper half and a
lower half composed of rank-1 blocks. This results in output features where the
upper sub-vector has &quot;richer&quot; features while the lower-sub vector has
&quot;constrained features&quot;. HMD can compress RNNs by a factor of 2-4x while having
a faster run-time than pruning (Zhu &amp;amp;Gupta, 2017) and retaining more model
accuracy than matrix factorization (Grachev et al., 2017). We evaluate this
technique on 5 benchmarks spanning 3 different applications, illustrating its
generality in the domain of edge computing.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Pathomechanisms and Clinical Implications of Myasthenic Syndromes Exacerbated and Induced by Medical Treatments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00156</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00156</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG), typically with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate pre-existing autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Some clinical observations are substantiated by experimental data, indicating that presynaptic, postsynaptic or more complex pathomechanisms at the NMJ may be involved, depending on the individual compound. Most robust data exist for the risks associated with some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, ketolides, fluoroquinolones) and cardiovascular medications (e.g., class Ia antiarrhythmics, beta blockers). Apart from primarily autoimmune-mediated disorders of the NMJ, de novo myasthenic manifestations may also be triggered by medical treatments that induce an autoimmune reaction. Most notably, there is growing evidence that the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a modern class of drugs to treat various malignancies, represent a relevant risk factor to develop severe and progressive medication-induced myasthenia via an immune-mediated mechanism. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physicians to be aware of such adverse treatment effects and their consequences. In this article, we aim to summarize existing evidence regarding the key molecular and immunological mechanisms as well as the clinical implications of medication-aggravated and medication-induced myasthenic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuronal Signaling Involved in Neuronal Polarization and Growth: Lipid Rafts and Phosphorylation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00150</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00150</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal polarization and growth are developmental processes that occur during neuronal cell differentiation. The molecular signaling mechanisms involved in these events in in vivo mammalian brain remain unclear. Also, cellular events of the neuronal polarization process within a given neuron are thought to be constituted of many independent intracellular signal transduction pathways (the “tug-of-war” model). However, in vivo results suggest that such pathways should be cooperative with one another among a given group of neurons in a region of the brain. Lipid rafts, specific membrane domains with low fluidity, are candidates for the hotspots of such intracellular signaling. Among the signals reported to be involved in polarization, a number are thought to be present or translocated to the lipid rafts in response to extracellular signals. As part of our analysis, we discuss how such novel molecular mechanisms are combined for effective regulation of neuronal polarization and growth, focusing on the significance of the lipid rafts, including results based on recently introduced methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Research Models and Gene Augmentation Therapy for CRB1 Retinal Dystrophies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00860</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) are inherited degenerative retinal dystrophies with vision loss that ultimately lead to blindness. Several genes have been shown to be involved in early onset retinal dystrophies, including CRB1 and RPE65. Gene therapy recently became available for young RP patients with variations in the RPE65 gene. Current research programs test adeno-associated viral gene augmentation or editing therapy vectors on various disease models mimicking the disease in patients. These include several animal and emerging human-derived models, such as human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids or hiPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and human donor retinal explants. Variations in the CRB1 gene are a major cause for early onset autosomal recessive RP with patients suffering from visual impairment before their adolescence and for LCA with newborns experiencing severe visual impairment within the first months of life. These patients cannot benefit yet from an available gene therapy treatment. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances, advantages and disadvantages of different CRB1 human and animal retinal degeneration models. In addition, we will describe novel therapeutic tools that have been developed, which could potentially be used for retinal gene augmentation therapy for RP patients with variations in the CRB1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Tyro3 Contributes to Retinal Ganglion Cell Function, Survival and Dendritic Density in the Mouse Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00840</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00840</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only output neurons of the vertebrate retina, integrating signals from other retinal neurons and transmitting information to the visual centers of the brain. The death of RGCs is a common outcome in many optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma, demyelinating optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy, resulting in visual defects and blindness. There are currently no therapies in clinical use which can prevent RGC death in optic neuropathies; therefore, the identification of new targets for supporting RGC survival is crucial in the development of novel treatments for eye diseases. In this study we identify that the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tyro3, is critical for normal neuronal function in the adult mouse retina. The loss of Tyro3 results in a reduction in photoreceptor and RGC function as measured using electroretinography. The reduction in RGC function was associated with a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer and fewer RGCs. In the central retina, independent of the loss of RGCs, Tyro3 deficiency resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of RGC dendrites in the inner plexiform layer. Our results show that Tyro3 has a novel, previously unidentified role in retinal function, RGC survival and RGC morphology. The Tyro3 pathway could therefore provide an alternative, targetable pathway for RGC protective therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Deep Brain Stimulation Effects on Gait Pattern in Advanced Parkinson’s Disease Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00814</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Gait disturbance accompanies many neurodegenerative diseases; it is characteristic for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Treatment of advanced PD often includes deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus. Regarding gait, previous studies have reported non-significant or conflicting results, possibly related to methodological limitations.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this prospective study was to assess the effects of DBS on biomechanical parameters of gait in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one patients with advanced PD participated in this prospective study. Gait was examined in all patients using the Zebris FDM-T pressure-sensitive treadmill (Isny, Germany) before DBS implantation and after surgery immediately, further immediately after the start of neurostimulation, and 3 months after neurostimulator activation. We assessed spontaneous gait on a moving treadmill at different speeds. Step length, stance phase of both lower limbs, double-stance phase, and cadence were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In this study, step length increased, allowing the cadence to decrease. Double-stance phase duration, that is, the most sensitive parameter of gait quality and unsteadiness, was reduced, in gait at a speed of 4.5 km/h and in the narrow-based gaits at 1 km/h (tandem gait), which demonstrates improvement.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study suggests positive effects of DBS treatment on gait in PD patients. Improvement was observed in several biomechanical parameters of gait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 1 Specifically Labels Seizure-Induced Hippocampal Reactive Neural Stem Cells and Regulates Their Division</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00811</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A population of neural stem cells (NSCs) dwelling in the dentate gyrus (DG) is able to generate neurons throughout adult life in the hippocampus of most mammals. These NSCs generate also astrocytes naturally and are capable of generating oligodendrocytes after gene manipulation. It has been more recently shown that adult hippocampal NSCs after epileptic seizures as well as subventricular zone NSCs after stroke can give rise to reactive astrocytes (RAs). In the hippocampus, the induction of seizures triggers the conversion of NSCs into reactive NSCs (React-NSCs) characterized by a drastic morphological transformation, abnormal migration, and massive activation or entry into the cell cycle to generate more React-NSCs that ultimately differentiate into RAs. In the search for tools to investigate the properties of React-NSCs, we have explored the LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic line of mice in which hippocampal NSCs are specifically labeled due to the expression of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We first addressed the validity of the transgene expression as true marker of LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; expression and then demonstrated how, after seizures, LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP labeled exclusively React-NSCs for several weeks. Then React-NSCs lost LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP expression as neurons of the granule cell layer started to express it. Finally, we used knockout for LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transgenic mice to show that LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; plays a functional role in the activation of React-NSCs. Thus, we confirmed that LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP expression is a valid tool to study both NSCs and React-NSCs and that the LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pathway could be a target in the intent to preserve NSCs after seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Motor Functional Reorganization Is Triggered by Tumor Infiltration Into the Primary Motor Area and Repeated Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00327</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In patients with gliomas, motor deficits are not always observed, even though tumor cells infiltrate into the motor area. Currently, it is recognized that this phenomenon can occur through the neuroplasticity potential. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of motor functional reorganization in gliomas. Out of 100 consecutive patients who underwent awake surgery, 29 patients were assessed as regards their motor function and were retrospectively explored to determine whether positive motor responses were elicited. A total of 73 positive mapping sites from 27 cases were identified, and their spatial anatomical locations and activated region by functional MRI were analyzed. Additionally, the factors promoting neuroplasticity were analyzed through multiple logistic regression analysis. As a result, a total of 60 points (21 cases) were found in place, while 13 points (17.8%) were found to be shifted from anatomical localization. Reorganizations were classified into three categories: Type 1 (move to ipsilateral different gyrus) was detected at nine points (four cases), and they moved into the postcentral gyrus. Type 2 (move within the ipsilateral precentral gyrus) was detected at four points (two cases). Unknown type (two cases) was categorized as those whose motor functional cortex was moved to other regions, although we could not find the compensated motor area. Two factors for the onset of reorganization were identified: tumor cells infiltrate into the primary motor area and repeated surgery (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0070, respectively). Our study demonstrated that compensation can occur mainly in two ways, and it promoted repeated surgery and infiltration of tumor into the primary motor area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation has shown to benefit a wide range of conditions and symptoms, but the neural mechanisms underlying the practice remain unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the structural brain changes due to the practice by examining volume, density, or cortical thickness changes. However, these studies have focused on adults; meditation’s structural effects on the adolescent brain remain understudied. In this study, we investigated how meditation training affects the structure of the adolescent brain by scanning a group of 38 adolescents (16.48 ± 1.29 years) before and after participating in a 12-week meditation training. Subjects underwent Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA), a program that mainly incorporates elements from mindfulness meditation and yoga-based practices. A subset of the adolescents also received an additional control scan 12 weeks before TARA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess gray matter volume changes pre- to post-training and during the control period. Subjects showed significant gray matter (GM) volume decreases in the left posterior insula and to a lesser extent in the left thalamus and left putamen after meditation training. There were no significant changes during the control period. Our results support previous findings that meditation affects regions associated with physical and emotional awareness. However, our results are different from previous morphometric studies in which meditation was associated with structural increases. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the differences between the adolescent brain and the adult brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Coordination Dynamics: A Foundation for Understanding Social Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00317</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans’ interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people…) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Project DyAdd: Non-linguistic Theories of Dyslexia Predict Intelligence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00316</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two themes have puzzled the research on developmental and learning disorders for decades. First, some of the risk and protective factors behind developmental challenges are suggested to be shared and some are suggested to be specific for a given condition. Second, language-based learning difficulties like dyslexia are suggested to result from or correlate with non-linguistic aspects of information processing as well. In the current study, we investigated how adults with developmental dyslexia or ADHD as well as healthy controls cluster across various dimensions designed to tap the prominent non-linguistic theories of dyslexia. Participants were 18–55-year-old adults with dyslexia (n = 36), ADHD (n = 22), and controls (n = 35). Non-linguistic theories investigated with experimental designs included temporal processing impairment, abnormal cerebellar functioning, procedural learning difficulties, as well as visual processing and attention deficits. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to investigate the emerging groups and patterns of results across these experimental designs. LPA suggested three groups: (1) a large group with average performance in the experimental designs, (2) participants predominantly from the clinical groups but with enhanced conditioning learning, and (3) participants predominantly from the dyslexia group with temporal processing as well as visual processing and attention deficits. Despite the presence of these distinct patterns, participants did not cluster very well based on their original status, nor did the LPA groups differ in their dyslexia or ADHD-related neuropsychological profiles. Remarkably, the LPA groups did differ in their intelligence. These results highlight the continuous and overlapping nature of the observed difficulties and support the multiple deficit model of developmental disorders, which suggests shared risk factors for developmental challenges. It also appears that some of the risk factors suggested by the prominent non-linguistic theories of dyslexia relate to the general level of functioning in tests of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional and Structural Plasticity Co-express in a Left Premotor Region During Early Bimanual Skill Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00310</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00310</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Motor skill learning already triggers the functional reorganization of regional brain activity after short periods of training. Recent studies suggest that microstructural change may emerge at similar timescales, but the spatiotemporal profiles of functional and structural plasticity have rarely been traced in parallel. Recently, we demonstrated that 5 days of endoscopic skill training induces changes in task-related brain activity in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and other areas of the frontoparietal grasping network. Here, we analyzed microstructural data, collected during the same experiment to investigate if microstructural plasticity overlaps temporally and spatially with the training-induced changes in task-related brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine students were divided into a full-routine group (n = 20), that underwent three endoscopy training sessions in the MR-scanner as well as a 5-day virtual reality (VR)-endoscopy training and a brief-routine group (n = 19), that only performed the in-scanner endoscopy training sessions. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were collected at baseline, after the first and after the last VR-training session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The full-routine group showed significant FA changes in a left-hemispheric subcortical cluster underlying the PMv region, for which we previously demonstrated functional plasticity during endoscopy training in the same sample. Functional (task-related fMRI) and structural (FA) changes showed the largest change from the first to the second scan, suggesting similar temporal dynamics. In the full-routine group, the FA change in the subcortical cluster underlying the left PMv scaled positively with the individual improvement in endoscopic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Microstructural white-matter plasticity mirrors the spatiotemporal profile of task-dependent plasticity during a 5-day course of endoscopy skill training. The observed similarities motivate future research on the interplay between functional and structural plasticity during early skill acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Activation During Visually Guided Finger Movements</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computer interaction via visually guided hand movements often employs either abstract cursor-based feedback or virtual hand (VH) representations of varying degrees of realism. The effect of changing this visual feedback in virtual reality settings is currently unknown. In this study, 19 healthy right-handed adults performed index finger movements (“action”) and observed movements (“observation”) with four different types of visual feedback: a simple circular cursor (CU), a point light (PL) pattern indicating finger joint positions, a shadow cartoon hand (SH) and a realistic VH. Finger movements were recorded using a data glove, and eye-tracking was recorded optically. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both action and observation conditions showed stronger fMRI signal responses in the occipitotemporal cortex compared to baseline. The action conditions additionally elicited elevated bilateral activations in motor, somatosensory, parietal, and cerebellar regions. For both conditions, feedback of a hand with a moving finger (SH, VH) led to higher activations than CU or PL feedback, specifically in early visual regions and the occipitotemporal cortex. Our results show the stronger recruitment of a network of cortical regions during visually guided finger movements with human hand feedback when compared to a visually incomplete hand and abstract feedback. This information could have implications for the design of visually guided tasks involving human body parts in both research and application or training-related paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Benefit of Cross-Modal Reorganization on Speech Perception in Pediatric Cochlear Implant Recipients Revealed Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00308</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00308</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cochlear implants (CIs) are the most successful treatment for severe-to-profound deafness in children. However, speech outcomes with a CI often lag behind those of normally-hearing children. Some authors have attributed these deficits to the takeover of the auditory temporal cortex by vision following deafness, which has prompted some clinicians to discourage the rehabilitation of pediatric CI recipients using visual speech. We studied this cross-modal activity in the temporal cortex, along with responses to auditory speech and non-speech stimuli, in experienced CI users and normally-hearing controls of school-age, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Strikingly, CI users displayed significantly greater cortical responses to visual speech, compared with controls. Importantly, in the same regions, the processing of auditory speech, compared with non-speech stimuli, did not significantly differ between the groups. This suggests that visual and auditory speech are processed synergistically in the temporal cortex of children with CIs, and they should be encouraged, rather than discouraged, to use visual speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Development of Print-Speech Integration in the Brain of Beginning Readers With Varying Reading Skills</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning print-speech sound correspondences is a crucial step at the beginning of reading acquisition and often impaired in children with developmental dyslexia. Despite increasing insight into audiovisual language processing, it remains largely unclear how integration of print and speech develops at the neural level during initial learning in the first years of schooling. To investigate this development, 32 healthy, German-speaking children at varying risk for developmental dyslexia (17 typical readers and 15 poor readers) participated in a longitudinal study including behavioral and fMRI measurements in first (T1) and second (T2) grade. We used an implicit audiovisual (AV) non-word target detection task aimed at characterizing differential activation to congruent (AVc) and incongruent (AVi) audiovisual non-word pairs. While children’s brain activation did not differ between AVc and AVi pairs in first grade, an incongruency effect (AVi &amp;gt; AVc) emerged in bilateral inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri in second grade. Of note, pseudoword reading performance improvements with time were associated with the development of the congruency effect (AVc &amp;gt; AVi) in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) from first to second grade. Finally, functional connectivity analyses indicated divergent development and reading expertise dependent coupling from the left occipito-temporal and superior temporal cortex to regions of the default mode (precuneus) and fronto-temporal language networks. Our results suggest that audiovisual integration areas as well as their functional coupling to other language areas and areas of the default mode network show a different development in poor vs. typical readers at varying familial risk for dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Homeostatic Roles of the Proteostasis Network in Dendrites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00264</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is indispensable to the survival and function of all cells. Distinct from other cell types, neurons are long-lived, exhibiting architecturally complex and diverse multipolar projection morphologies that can span great distances. These properties present unique demands on proteostatic machinery to dynamically regulate the neuronal proteome in both space and time. Proteostasis is regulated by a distributed network of cellular processes, the proteostasis network (PN), which ensures precise control of protein synthesis, native conformational folding and maintenance, and protein turnover and degradation, collectively safeguarding proteome integrity both under homeostatic conditions and in the contexts of cellular stress, aging, and disease. Dendrites are equipped with distributed cellular machinery for protein synthesis and turnover, including dendritically trafficked ribosomes, chaperones, and autophagosomes. The PN can be subdivided into an adaptive network of three major functional pathways that synergistically govern protein quality control through the action of (1) protein synthesis machinery; (2) maintenance mechanisms including molecular chaperones involved in protein folding; and (3) degradative pathways (e.g., Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), endolysosomal pathway, and autophagy. Perturbations in any of the three arms of proteostasis can have dramatic effects on neurons, especially on their dendrites, which require tightly controlled homeostasis for proper development and maintenance. Moreover, the critical importance of the PN as a cell surveillance system against protein dyshomeostasis has been highlighted by extensive work demonstrating that the aggregation and/or failure to clear aggregated proteins figures centrally in many neurological disorders. While these studies demonstrate the relevance of derangements in proteostasis to human neurological disease, here we mainly review recent literature on homeostatic developmental roles the PN machinery plays in the establishment, maintenance, and plasticity of stable and dynamic dendritic arbors. Beyond basic housekeeping functions, we consider roles of PN machinery in protein quality control mechanisms linked to dendritic plasticity (e.g., dendritic spine remodeling during LTP); cell-type specificity; dendritic morphogenesis; and dendritic pruning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopaminergic Modulation of Signal Processing in a Subset of Retinal Bipolar Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00253</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00253</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The retina and the olfactory bulb are the gateways to the visual and olfactory systems, respectively, similarly using neural networks to initiate sensory signal processing. Sensory receptors receive signals that are transmitted to neural networks before projecting to primary cortices. These networks filter sensory signals based on their unique features and adjust their sensitivities by gain control systems. Interestingly, dopamine modulates sensory signal transduction in both systems. In the retina, dopamine adjusts the retinal network for daylight conditions (“light adaptation”). In the olfactory system, dopamine mediates lateral inhibition between the glomeruli, resulting in odorant signal decorrelation and discrimination. While dopamine is essential for signal discrimination in the olfactory system, it is not understood whether dopamine has similar roles in visual signal processing in the retina. To elucidate dopaminergic effects on visual processing, we conducted patch-clamp recording from second-order retinal bipolar cells, which exhibit multiple types that can convey different temporal features of light. We recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by various frequencies of sinusoidal light in the absence and presence of a dopamine receptor 1 (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) agonist or antagonist. Application of a D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist, SKF-38393, shifted the peak temporal responses toward higher frequencies in a subset of bipolar cells. In contrast, a D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist, SCH-23390, reversed the effects of SKF on these types of bipolar cells. To examine the mechanism of dopaminergic modulation, we recorded voltage-gated currents, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and low-voltage activated (LVA) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. SKF modulated HCN and LVA currents, suggesting that these channels are the target of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling to modulate visual signaling in these bipolar cells. Taken together, we found that dopamine modulates the temporal tuning of a subset of retinal bipolar cells. Consequently, we determined that dopamine plays a role in visual signal processing, which is similar to its role in signal decorrelation in the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Physical Activity Protects the Pathological Alterations of Alzheimer’s Disease Kidneys via the Activation of PACAP and BMP Signaling Pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00243</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with typical amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregations. Elimination of the Aβ precursors via the kidneys makes the organ a potential factor in the systemic degeneration leading to AD. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts neuroprotective effects in AD and plays a protective role in kidney pathologies. Increased physical activity is preventive of the formation of AD, but its detailed mechanism and possible connections with PACAP have not been clarified. In the kidneys of AD mice, the effects of physical activity were investigated by comparing wild-type and AD organs. Aβ plaque formation was reduced in AD kidneys after increased training (TAD). Mechanotransduction elevated PACAP receptor expression in TAD mice and normalized the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated pathways. BMP4/BMPR1 elevation activated Smad1 expression and normalized collagen type IV in TAD animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that elevated physical activity can prevent the AD-induced pathological changes in the kidneys via, at least in part, the activation of PACAP–BMP signaling crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Distribution of GFAP in Squamata: Extended Immunonegative Areas, Astrocytes, High Diversity, and Their Bearing on Evolution</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00049</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00049</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Squamata is one of the richest and most diverse extant groups. The present study investigates the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive elements of five lizard and three snake species; each represents a different family. The study continues our former studies on bird, turtle, and caiman brains. Although several studies have been published on lizards, they usually only investigated one species. Almost no data are available on snakes. The animals were transcardially perfused. Immunoperoxidase reactions were performed with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (Novocastra). The original radial ependymoglia is enmeshed by secondary, non-radial processes almost beyond recognition in several brain areas like in other reptiles. Astrocytes occur but only as complementary elements like in caiman but unlike in turtles, where astrocytes are absent. In most species, extended areas are free of GFAP—a meaningful difference from other reptiles. The predominance of astrocytes and the presence of areas free of GFAP immunopositivity are characteristic of birds and mammals; therefore, they must be apomorphic features of Squamata, which appeared independently from the evolution of avian glia. However, these features show a high diversity; in some lizards, they are even absent. There was no principal difference between the glial structures of snakes and lizards. In conclusion, the glial structure of Squamata seems to be the most apomorphic one among reptiles. The high diversity suggests that its evolution is still intense. The comparison of identical brain areas with different GFAP contents in different species may promote understanding the role of GFAP in neuronal networks. Our findings are in accordance with the supposal based on our previous studies that the GFAP-free areas expand during evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ultra-High-Resolution in vitro MRI Study of Age-Related Brain Subcortical Susceptibility Alteration in Rhesus Monkeys at 9.4 T</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Iron concentration in the brain has been suggested as a biomarker of pathologic neurodegeneration. However, the iron concentration changes in healthy aging as well. This study aimed to quantify the age-related changes in iron concentration in the gray matter of healthy rhesus monkeys using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Three-dimensional gradient-echo images of 16 female rhesus monkey brains aged between 2 and 26 years were acquired in vitro. The susceptibilities in the brain regions of the caudate nucleus (Cd), putamen (Pt), globus pallidus (Gp), and substantia nigra (Sn) were analyzed. The susceptibility varied across different brain regions, with higher levels in the Gp and Sn. Susceptibilities in all analyzed brain regions were linearly correlated with age, yet the plateau period as observed in human brains was absent. This is the first in vitro report of the age-related variability of susceptibility in the deep gray matter of rhesus monkey brains at 9.4 T, with an isotropic resolution of 150 μm. Awareness of age-related changes in susceptibility is vital for the establishment of a baseline to facilitate the differentiation of pathologic neurodegeneration from healthy aging in non-human primate studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: An Overview of Acoustic-Based Interventions to Improve Motor Symptoms in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits that negatively impact on activities of daily living. While dopaminergic medications are used to attenuate motor symptoms, adjuvant therapies such as acoustic-based non-pharmacological interventions are used as a complement to standard drug treatments. At present, preliminary studies of acoustic-based interventions such as rhythmic-auditory stimulation (RAS) and vibroacoustic therapy (VAT) suggest two competing hypotheses: (1) RAS may recruit alternative motor networks that may bypass faulty spatiotemporal motor networks of movement in PD; or (2) the use of RAS enhances BG function through entrainment of beta oscillatory activities. In this mini review article, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the role of acoustic-based interventions and how it may serve to improve motor deficits such as gait impairments and tremors. We further provide suggestions for future work that may use a combination of RAS, VAT, and physical therapy to improve motor function in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes Over Time of Diffusion MRI in the White Matter of Aging Brain, a Good Predictor of Verbal Recall</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00218</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Extensive research using water-diffusion MRI reported age-related modifications of cerebral White Matter (WM). Moreover, water-diffusion parameter modifications have been frequently associated with cognitive performances in the elderly sample, reinforcing the idea of aging inducing microstructural disconnection of the brain which in turn impacts cognition. However, only few studies really assessed over-time modifications of these parameters and their relationship with episodic memory outcome of elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: One-hundred and thirty elderly subjects without dementia (74.1 ± 4.1 years; 47% female) were included in this study. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed at two-time points (3.49 ± 0.68 years apart), allowing the assessment of changes in water-diffusion parameters over time using a specific longitudinal pipeline. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and gray matter (GM) atrophy were also measured on FLAIR and T1-weighted sequences collected during these two MRI sessions. Free and cued verbal recall scores assessed at the last follow-up of the cohort were used as episodic memory outcome. Changes in water-diffusion parameters over time were included in serial linear regression models to predict retrieval or storage ability of elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: GM atrophy and an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) and WMH load between the two-time points were observed. The increase in MD was significantly correlated with WMH load and the different memory scores. In models accounting for the baseline cognitive score, GM atrophy, or WMH load, MD changes still significantly predict free verbal recall, and not total verbal recall, suggesting the specific association with the retrieval deficit in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In elderly, microstructural WM changes are good predictors of lower free verbal recall performances. Moreover, this contribution is not only driven by WMH load increase. This last observation is in line with studies reporting early water-diffusion modification in WM tissue during aging, resulting lately in the appearance of WMH on conventional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Modulation of the Aβ-Peptide-Aggregation Pathway by Active Compounds From Platycladus orientalis Seed Extract in Alzheimer’s Disease Models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and aphasia. Aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in the brain is considered a key mechanism in the development of AD. In the past 20 years, many compounds have been developed to inhibit Aβ aggregation and accelerate its degradation. Platycladus orientalis seed is a traditional Chinese medicine used to enhance intelligence and slow aging. We previously found that Platycladus orientalis seed extract (EPOS) inhibited Aβ-peptide aggregation in the hippocampus and reduced cognitive deficits in 5×FAD mice. However, the mechanisms of these effects have not been characterized. To characterize the protective mechanisms of EPOS, we used a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model to perform Bioactivity-guided identification of active compounds. Four active compounds, comprising communic acid, isocupressic acid, imbricatolic acid, and pinusolide, were identified using 13C-and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we showed that isocupressic acid inhibited Aβ generation by modulating BACE1 activity via the GSK3β/NF-κB pathway in HEK293-APPsw cells. These findings showed that EPOS reduced cognitive deficits in an AD model via modulation of the Aβ peptide aggregation pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine whether osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with a change in adjusted hippocampal volumes (HpVR: hippocampal/intracranial volume × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over time among cognitively normal older people.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of OA with HpVR among individuals with normal cognition (NC) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. At baseline, a total of 372 individuals with NC were included.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the cross-sectional analyses of baseline data, we did not find a significant relationship between OA and HpVR among individuals with NC. However, in the longitudinal analyses, OA was significantly associated with change in HpVR over time among individuals with NC. Specifically, compared with individuals without OA, those with OA showed a faster decline in HpVR over time when controlling for other potential confounders, including age, educational attainment, gender, and APOE4 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;OA status was significantly associated with a change in HpVR over time among individuals with NC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The cerebral cortex and cerebellum both play important roles in sensorimotor processing, however, precise connections between these major brain structures remain elusive. Using anterograde mono-trans-synaptic tracing, we elucidate cerebrocerebellar pathways originating from primary motor, sensory, and association cortex. We confirm a highly organized topography of corticopontine projections in mice; however, we found no corticopontine projections originating from primary auditory cortex and detail several potential extra-pontine cerebrocerebellar pathways. The cerebellar hemispheres were the major target of resulting disynaptic mossy fiber terminals, but we also found at least sparse cerebrocerebellar projections to every lobule of the cerebellum. Notably, projections originating from association cortex resulted in less laterality than primary sensory/motor cortices. Within molecularly defined cerebellar modules we found spatial overlap of mossy fiber terminals, originating from functionally distinct cortical areas, within crus I, paraflocculus, and vermal regions IV/V and VI - highlighting these regions as potential hubs for multimodal cortical influence.</description>

	<title>eLife: ALKBH7 mediates necrosis via rewiring of glyoxal metabolism</title>

	<description>Alkb homolog 7 (ALKBH7) is a mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase required for DNA alkylation induced necrosis, but its function and substrates remain unclear. Herein we show ALKBH7 regulates dialdehyde metabolism, which impacts the cardiac response to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Using a multi-omics approach, we find no evidence ALKBH7 functions as a prolyl-hydroxylase, but we do find &lt;i&gt;Alkbh7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have elevated glyoxalase I (GLO-1), a dialdehyde detoxifying enzyme. Metabolic pathways related to the glycolytic by-product methylglyoxal (MGO) are rewired in &lt;i&gt;Alkbh7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, along with elevated levels of MGO protein adducts. Despite greater glycative stress, hearts from &lt;i&gt;Alkbh7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice are protected against IR injury, in a manner blocked by GLO-1 inhibition. Integrating these observations, we propose ALKBH7 regulates glyoxal metabolism, and that protection against necrosis and cardiac IR injury bought on by ALKBH7 deficiency originates from the signaling response to elevated MGO stress.</description>

	<title>eLife: Splicing variation of BMP2K balances abundance of COPII assemblies and autophagic degradation in erythroid cells</title>

	<description>Intracellular transport undergoes remodeling upon cell differentiation, which involves cell type-specific regulators. Bone morphogenetic protein 2-inducible kinase (BMP2K) has been potentially implicated in endocytosis and cell differentiation but its molecular functions remained unknown. We discovered that its longer (L) and shorter (S) splicing variants regulate erythroid differentiation in a manner unexplainable by their involvement in AP-2 adaptor phosphorylation and endocytosis. However, both variants interact with SEC16A and could localize to the juxtanuclear secretory compartment. Variant-specific depletion approach showed that BMP2K isoforms constitute a BMP2K-L/S regulatory system that controls the distribution of SEC16A and SEC24B as well as SEC31A abundance at COPII assemblies. Finally, we found L to promote and S to restrict autophagic degradation and erythroid differentiation. Hence, we propose that BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S differentially regulate abundance and distribution of COPII assemblies as well as autophagy, possibly thereby fine-tuning erythroid differentiation.</description>

	<title>eLife: The manifold actions of signaling peptides on subcellular dynamics of a receptor specify stomatal cell fate</title>

	<description>Receptor endocytosis is important for signal activation, transduction, and deactivation. However, how a receptor interprets conflicting signals to adjust cellular output is not clearly understood. Using genetic, cell biological, and pharmacological approaches, we report here that ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1), the major receptor restricting plant stomatal differentiation, undergoes dynamic subcellular behaviors in response to different EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF) peptides. Activation of ERL1 by EPF1 induces rapid ERL1 internalization via multivesicular bodies/late endosomes to vacuolar degradation, whereas ERL1 constitutively internalizes in the absence of EPF1. The co-receptor, TOO MANY MOUTHS is essential for ERL1 internalization induced by EPF1 but not by EPFL6. The peptide antagonist, Stomagen, triggers retention of ERL1 in the endoplasmic reticulum, likely coupled with reduced endocytosis. In contrast, the dominant-negative ERL1 remained dysfunctional in ligand-induced subcellular trafficking. Our study elucidates that multiple related yet unique peptides specify cell fate by deploying the differential subcellular dynamics of a single receptor.</description>

	<description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important but difficult to study human pathogen. Most basics of the hepadnaviral life-cycle were unraveled using duck HBV (DHBV) as a model although DHBV has a capsid protein (CP) comprising ~260 rather than ~180 amino acids. Here we present high-resolution structures of several DHBV capsid-like particles (CLPs) determined by electron cryo-microscopy. As for HBV, DHBV CLPs consist of a dimeric a-helical frame-work with protruding spikes at the dimer interface. A fundamental new feature is a ~45 amino acid proline-rich extension in each monomer replacing the tip of the spikes in HBV CP. In vitro, folding of the extension takes months, implying a catalyzed process &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. DHBc variants lacking a folding-proficient extension produced regular CLPs in bacteria but failed to form stable nucleocapsids in hepatoma cells. We propose that the extension domain acts as a conformational switch with differential response options during viral infection.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is required for optimal brown fat thermogenesis</title>

	<description>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is composed of thermogenic cells that convert chemical energy into heat to help maintain a constant body temperature and counteract metabolic disease in mammals. The metabolic adaptations required for thermogenesis are not fully understood. Here we explore how steady state levels of metabolic intermediates are altered in brown adipose tissue in response to cold exposure. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed changes in pathways involved in amino acid, glucose, and TCA cycle metabolism. Using isotopic labeling experiments, we found that activated brown adipocytes increased labeling of pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates from U&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-glucose. Although glucose oxidation has been implicated as being essential for thermogenesis, its requirement for efficient thermogenesis has not been directly tested. Here we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is essential for optimal thermogenesis, as conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Mpc1&lt;/i&gt; in brown adipocytes leads to impaired cold adaptation. Isotopic labeling experiments using U&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-glucose showed that loss of MPC1 led to impaired labeling of TCA cycle intermediates, while labeling of glycolytic intermediates was unchanged. Loss of MPC1 in BAT increased 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood and BAT in response to the cold, suggesting that ketogenesis provides an alternative fuel source to compensate for impaired mitochondrial oxidation of cytosolic pyruvate. Collectively, these studies highlight that complete glucose oxidation is essential for optimal brown fat thermogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Embodied Cognition and Decision-Making in the Primate Superior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.251777v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.251777v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A popular model of decision-making suggests that in primates, including humans, decisions evolve within forebrain structures responsible for preparing voluntary actions; a concert referred to as embodied cognition. Embodied cognition posits that in decision tasks, neuronal activity generally associated with preparing an action, actually reflects the accumulation of evidence for a particular decision. Testing the embodied cognition model causally is challenging because dissociating the evolution of a decision from preparing a motor act is difficult, if the same neuronal activity instantiates both processes. Ideally, one would show that manipulation of neuronal activity thought to be involved in movement preparation actually alters decisions, and not movement preparation. Here, trained monkeys performed a two-choice perceptual decision-making task in which they judged the orientation of a dynamic Glass pattern before and after unilateral, reversible inactivation of a brainstem area involved in preparing eye movements, the superior colliculus (SC). Surprisingly, we found that unilateral SC inactivation produced significant decision biases and changes in reaction times consistent with a role for the SC in evidence accumulation. Fitting signal detection theory and sequential sampling models (drift-diffusion and urgency-gating) to the data revealed that SC inactivation produced a decrease in the relative evidence for contralateral decisions. Control experiments showed that SC inactivation did not result in eye movement biases ruling out interpretations based on motor preparation or spatial attentional impairment. The results provide causal evidence for an embodied cognition model of perceptual decision-making and provide compelling evidence that the SC of primates plays a causal role in modulating evidence accumulation for perceptual decisions, a process that is usually attributed to the cerebral cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Implicit anticipation of probabilistic regularities: Larger CNV emerges for unpredictable events</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.251686v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.251686v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Anticipation of upcoming events plays a crucial role in automatic behaviors. It is, however, still unclear whether the event-related brain potential (ERP) markers of anticipation could track the implicit acquisition of probabilistic regularities that can be considered as building blocks of automatic behaviors. Therefore, in a four-choice reaction time (RT) task performed by young adults (N = 36), the contingent negative variation (CNV) as an ERP marker of anticipation was measured from the onset of an uninformative warning signal until the presentation of the target stimulus. Due to the probability structure of the task, target stimuli were either predictable or unpredictable, but this was unknown to participants. Results showed that the CNV amplitude during response preparation was larger before the unpredictable than before the predictable stimuli. In addition, although RTs increased, the P3 amplitude decreased for the unpredictable as compared with the predictable stimuli, possibly due to the stronger response preparation that preceded stimulus presentation. These results suggest that enhanced attentional resources are allocated to the implicit anticipation and processing of unpredictable events. This possibly results from the formation of internal models on the probabilistic regularities of the stimulus stream, favoring predictable events. Overall, we provide ERP evidence for the implicit anticipation of probabilistic regularities, confirming the role of predictive processes in learning and memory.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A neuronal ensemble encoding adaptive choice during sensory conflict</title>

	<description>Feeding decisions are fundamental to survival, and decision making is often disrupted in disease, yet the neuronal and molecular mechanisms of adaptive decision making are not well understood. Here we show that the neural activity in a small population of neurons projecting to the fan-shaped body in the central brain of Drosophila represents food choice during sensory conflict. We found that hungry flies made tradeoffs between appetitive and aversive values of food in a decision making task to choose unpalatable bittersweet food with high sucrose concentration over sucrose-only food with less sucrose. Using cell-specific optogenetics and receptor RNAi knockdown during the decision task, we identified an upstream neuropeptidergic and dopaminergic network that likely relays internal state and other decision relevant information, like valence and previous experience, to the fan-shaped body. Importantly, calcium imaging revealed that these fan-shaped body neurons were strongly inhibited by rejected food choice, suggesting that this neural activity is a representation of behavioral choice. FB response to food choice is modulated by taste, previous experience, and hunger state, which the fan-shaped body neurons likely integrate to encode choice before relaying decision information to downstream motor circuits for behavioral implementation. Our results uncover a neural substrate for choice encoding in a genetically tractable model to enable mechanistic dissection of decision making at neuronal, cellular, and molecular levels.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Multisensory processes can compensate for attention deficits in schizophrenia</title>

	<description>Previous conflicting findings on multisensory integration in schizophrenia might be related to differences in top-down attention demands across the different studies. We tested this with a visuo-tactile stimulation paradigm and high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the interplay between multisensory integration and top-down intersensory attention in healthy controls (N=27) and in people with schizophrenia (N=27). Unisensory visual, unisensory tactile or bisensory stimuli while participants attended to either visual or tactile inputs. D-prime values, ERPs, clinical symptomatology, and cognitive performance were examined, comparing the interplay of intersensory attention and multisensory integration between groups. The former was impaired in the schizophrenia group at the behavioral level, but only for unisensory and not for multisensory stimuli. ERPs showed earlier intersensory attention responses (&amp;lt;200ms) were intact in the schizophrenia group, but diminished later (&amp;gt;230ms) over frontal and occipital brain areas. In contrast, multiple phases of multisensory integration, starting around 240ms, were preserved in the schizophrenia group. There was no correlation between ERP response and positive or negative symptoms. Our study provides evidence for long latency intersensory attention deficits in schizophrenia, presumably reflecting aberrant top-down processing. These findings indicate that uncompromised integrative multisensory processes, which elevate and capture attention, may serve as a compensatory mechanism for aberrant top-down processing in schizophrenia. Differences in attentional demands may have contributed to previous conflicting findings.</description>

	<description>Signaling through distinct growth factor pathways is required for long-term memory (LTM) in Aplysia. In a two-trial paradigm, Trial 1 TrkB signaling is required for expression of the immediate early gene apc/ebp, which is transient and necessary, but insufficient, for LTM formation. A prolonged increase in apc/ebp gene expression, which is both necessary and sufficient for LTM is achieved through TGF{beta} signaling during Trial 2. Here we demonstrate: (1) the prolonged increase in apc/ebp expression is not dependent on de novo transcription but is dependent on p38 MAPK activity induced by TGF{beta} ; (2) Trial 2 increases the interaction between apc/ebp mRNA and the stabilizing RNA-binding protein ApELAV; and (3) inhibition of the apc/ebp mRNA-ApELAV interaction blocks induction of LTM. These results reveal a novel role for post-transcriptional gene regulation: the stabilization of a specific transcript, apc/ebp, by ELAV-like proteins, as a critical molecular step in LTM formation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A chlorzoxazone-baclofen combination improves cerebellar impairment in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.251330v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.251330v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>BackgroundA combination of central muscle relaxants, chlorzoxazone and baclofen (chlorzoxazone-baclofen), has been proposed for treatment of cerebellar symptoms in human spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). However, central muscle relaxants can worsen balance. The optimal dose for target engagement without toxicity remains unknown.

ObjectivesUsing the genetically precise Atxn1154Q/2Q model of SCA1, we determine the role of cerebellar dysfunction in motor impairment. We also aim to identify appropriate concentrations of chlorzoxazone-baclofen needed for target engagement without toxicity to plan for human clinical trials.

MethodsWe use patch clamp electrophysiology in acute cerebellar slices and immunostaining to identify the specific ion channels targeted by chlorzoxazone-baclofen. Behavioral assays for coordination and grip strength are used to determine specificity of chlorzoxazone-baclofen for improving cerebellar dysfunction without off-target effects in Atxn1154Q/2Q mice.

ResultsWe identify irregular Purkinje neuron firing in association with reduced expression of the ion channels Kcnma1 and Cacna1g in Atxn1154Q/2Q mice. Using in vitro electrophysiology in brain slices, we identify concentrations of chlorzoxazone-baclofen that improve Purkinje neuron spike regularity without reducing firing frequency. At a disease stage in Atxn1154Q/2Q mice when motor impairment is due to cerebellar dysfunction, orally administered chlorzoxazone-baclofen improves motor performance without affecting muscle strength.

ConclusionWe identify a tight relationship between baclofen-chlorzoxazone concentrations needed to engage target, and levels above which cerebellar function will be compromised. We propose to use this information for a novel clinical trial design, using sequential dose escalation within each subject, to identify dose levels that are likely to improve ataxia symptoms while minimizing toxicity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Post-tetanic potentiation lowers the energy barrier for synaptic vesicle fusion independently of Synaptotagmin-1</title>

	<description>Previously, we showed that modulation of the energy barrier for synaptic vesicle fusion boosts release rates supralinearly (Schotten, 2015). Here we show that mouse hippocampal synapses employ this principle to trigger Ca2+-dependent vesicle release and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). We assess energy barrier changes by fitting release kinetics in response to hypertonic sucrose. Mimicking activation of the C2A domain of the Ca2+-sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), by adding a positive charge (Syt1D232N) or increasing its hydrophobicity (Syt14W), lowers the energy barrier. Removing Syt1 or impairing its release inhibitory function (Syt19Pro) increases spontaneous release without affecting the fusion barrier. Both phorbol esters and tetanic stimulation potentiate synaptic strength, and lower the energy barrier equally well in the presence and absence of Syt1. We propose a model where tetanic stimulation activates Syt1 dependent and independent mechanisms that lower the energy barrier independently in an additive manner to produce PTP by multiplication of release rates.</description>

A growing literature is employing EEG-ms-based analyses to study various mental illnesses and to evaluate brain mechanisms implicated in cognitive and emotional processing. The spatial and functional interpretation of the EEG-ms is still being investigated. Previous works studied the association of EEG-ms time courses with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal and suggested an association between EEG-ms and resting-state networks (RSNs). However, the distinctive association between EEG-ms temporal dynamics and brain neuronal activities is still not clear, despite the assumption that EEG-ms are an electrophysiological representation of RSNs activity. Recent works suggest a role for brain spontaneous EEG rhythms in contributing to and modulating canonical EEG-ms topographies and determining their classes (coined A through D) and metrics. This work simultaneously utilized EEG and fMRI to understand the EEG-ms and their properties further. We adopted the canonical EEG-ms analysis to extract three types of regressors for EEG-informed fMRI analyses: EEG-ms direct time courses, temporal activity per microstate, and pairwise temporal transitions among microstates (the latter two coined activity regressors). After convolving EEG-ms regressors with a hemodynamic response function, a generalized linear model whole-brain voxel-wise analysis was conducted to associate EEG-ms regressors with fMRI signals. The direct time course regressors replicated prior findings of the association between the fMRI signal and EEG-ms time courses but to a smaller extent. Notably, EEG-ms activity regressors were mostly anticorrelated with fMRI, including brain regions in the somatomotor, visual, dorsal attention, and ventral attention fMRI networks with no significant overlap for default mode, limbic or frontoparietal networks. A similar pattern emerged in using the transition regressors among microstates but not in self-transitions. The relatively short duration of each EEG-ms and the significant association of EEG-ms activity regressors with fMRI signals suggest that EEG-ms manifests successive transition from one brain functional state to another rather than being associated with specific brain functional state or RSN networks.</description>

	<description>Gap junctions promote correlated spiking between coupled neurons. Recording from pairs of coupled retinal ganglion cells, we find that differences in firing rate between coupled neurons dictates which cell leads correlated spike-pairs, and that the precise temporal order of spike activity between pairs of cells changes depending on the spatial position of a visual stimulus. We thus demonstrate a spike order spatial code for encoding sensory information.</description>

	<description>Neuroimaging studies have shown that, despite the abstractness of music, it may mimic biologically rewarding stimuli (e.g. food) in its ability to engage the brains reward circuity. However, due to the lack of research comparing music and other types of reward, it is unclear to what extent the recruitment of reward-related structures overlaps among domains. To achieve this goal, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 38 neuroimaging studies (703 subjects) comparing the brain responses specifically to music and food-induced pleasure. Both engaged a common set of brain regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. Yet, comparative analyses indicated a partial dissociation in the engagement of the reward circuitry as a function of the type of reward, as well as additional reward type-specific activations in brain regions related to perception, sensory processing, and learning. These results support the idea that hedonic reactions rely on the engagement of a common reward network, yet through specific routes of access depending on the modality and nature of the reward.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Time-course of systems consolidation and fear memory generalization in adolescent rats of different sex</title>

	<description>Systems consolidation is a time-dependent process in which the retrieval of contextual memories becomes progressively independent from the hippocampus and more reliant on cortical structures. One qualitative consequence, supposed to be causally related, is the progressive loss of memory precision. Memory generalization, however, is a much more complex phenomena, and may take place much faster in adult animals, for instance, in response to changes in the available levels of sex hormones. In this sense, females are known to display a generalized memory earlier than males. Sex differences might have an important role in the modulation of mnemonic processes, and despite being of paramount importance for the understanding of the cognitive dynamics of juveniles, it remains poorly investigated. Here, we studied adolescent rats (P42-49) of different sex comparing the natural time-course of systems consolidation as verified both by the hippocampus-dependency and the onset of memory generalization. Contextual fear discrimination was quantified at different time-points after learning (2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days). Our results demonstrated that, contrary to what is observed in adults, memory generalization occurs earlier in adolescent males (14 days) than in females (28 days). During adolescence, females display a higher mean discrimination index at all time-points, suggesting that they retain a more detailed memory. Likewise, pre-test pharmacological inactivation of the hippocampus (with GABAA agonist muscimol) was able to impair memory retrieval in females, but not in males, 14 days after training. These results support a causal relationship between memory generalization and retrieval independence from the hippocampus in male adolescent rats. However, both aspects of the systems consolidation process appear to be distinctly modulated in animals of different sex, with males (and ovariectomized females) enduring an accelerated onset of both memory precision loss and the hippocampus independence compared to females, suggesting a clear role for gonadal hormones in this cognitive corticalization process.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Mapping the Human Visual Thalamus and its Cytoarchitectonic Subdivisions Using Quantitative MRI</title>

	<description>The human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the visual thalamus is a key subcortical processing site for visual information analysis. A non-invasive assessment of the LGN and its functionally and microstructurally distinct magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) subdivisions in-vivo in humans is challenging, because of its small size and location deep inside the brain. Here we tested whether recent advances in high-field structural quantitative MRI (qMRI) can enable MR-based mapping of human LGN subdivisions. We employed ultra-high resolution 7 Tesla qMRI of a post-mortem human LGN specimen and high-resolution 7 Tesla in-vivo qMRI in a large participant sample. We found that a quantitative assessment of the LGN and a differentiation of its subdivisions was possible based on microstructure-informed MR-contrast alone. In both the post-mortem and in-vivo qMRI data, we identified two components of shorter and longer longitudinal relaxation time (T1) within the LGN that coincided with the known anatomical locations of a dorsal P and a ventral M subdivision, respectively. Through a subsequent ground truth histological examination of the same post-mortem LGN specimen, we showed that the observed T1 contrast pertains to cyto- and myeloarchitectonic differences between LGN subdivisions. These differences were based on cell and myelin density, but not on iron content. Our qMRI-based mapping strategy overcomes shortcomings of previous fMRI-based mapping approaches. It paves the way for an in-depth understanding of the function and microstructure of the LGN in humans. It also enables investigations into the selective contributions of LGN subdivisions to human behavior in health and disease.

Significance StatementThe lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is a key processing site for the analysis of visual information. Due to its small size and deep location within the brain, non-invasive mapping of the LGN and its microstructurally distinct subdivisions in humans is challenging. Using quantitative MRI methods that are sensitive to underlying microstructural tissue features, we show that a differentiation of the LGN and its microstructurally distinct subdivisions is feasible in humans non-invasively. These findings are important because they open up novel opportunities to assess the hitherto poorly understood complex role of the LGN in human perception and cognition, as well as the contribution of selective LGN subdivision impairments to various clinical conditions including developmental dyslexia, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The effects of regular aerobic exercise on hippocampal structure and function</title>

	<description>Engaging in regular exercise has numerous benefits for brain health. In particular, a number of studies have associated exercise with improvements to the structure and function of the hippocampus, especially in older adults. This region plays a critical role in memory function, and is altered in a number of psychiatric disorders associated with memory impairments (e.g. depression and schizophrenia), as well as healthy ageing. Thus, exercise may provide an effective method of enhancing / ameliorating hippocampal integrity; however, an improved understanding of exercise-related effects in young to middle-aged adults is required. We assessed the effects of regular exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness on hippocampal structure and function in young to middle-aged adults. We recruited a sample of 40 healthy adults, comprised of individuals who self-reported as engaging in high (regular exercisers) or low (sedentary) levels of physical activity (PA) according to World Health Organisation guidelines (high PA n=20; low PA n=20). A multi-modal assessment of hippocampal structure and function was conducted using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, and hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. We observed evidence of increased N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) concentration and associative memory performance in high PA individuals. However, no differences in hippocampal volume or pattern separation capacity were observed between groups. We found that cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with (left, right, and bilateral) hippocampal volume, NAA concentration, and pattern separation, but not associative memory. Therefore, we provide evidence that engaging in higher levels of exercise has demonstrable benefits for hippocampal integrity and function. Given that young and middle-aged adults are overrepresented in the diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses which affect hippocampal integrity (e.g. depression and schizophrenia), it is possible that exercise may provide a low-risk, effective method of remediating this dysfunction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Propagation and update of auditory perceptual priors through alpha and theta rhythms</title>

	<description>To maintain a continuous and coherent percept over time, the brain makes use of past sensory information to anticipate forthcoming stimuli. We recently showed that auditory experience in the immediate past is propagated through ear-specific reverberations, manifested as rhythmic fluctuations of decision bias at alpha frequency. Here, we apply the same time-resolved behavioural method to investigate how perceptual performance changes over time under conditions of high stimulus expectation, and to examine the effect of unexpected events on behaviour. As in our previous study, participants were required to discriminate the ear-of-origin of a brief monaural pure tone embedded in uncorrelated dichotic white noise. We manipulated stimulus expectation by increasing the target probability in one ear to 80%. Consistent with our earlier findings, performance did not remain constant across trials, but varied rhythmically with delay from noise onset. Specifically, decision bias showed a similar oscillation at ~9 Hz that depended on ear congruency between successive targets. This suggests rhythmic communication of auditory perceptual history occurs early and is not readily influenced by top-down expectations. In addition, we report a novel observation specific to infrequent, unexpected stimuli that gave rise to oscillations in accuracy at ~7.6 Hz one trial after the target occurred in the non-anticipated ear. This new behavioural oscillation may reflect a mechanism for updating the sensory representation once a prediction error has been detected.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Standing on elevated platform changes postural responses during arm movement</title>

	<description>This study investigated the muscle activity during the preparatory (anticipatory postural adjustment, APA), execution (online postural adjustments, OPA), and compensatory (compensatory postural adjustment, CPA) phases during standing with eyes opened or closed on an elevated platform. Eight healthy young women stood in the upright position, with eyes opened or closed, and did as-fast-as-they-could shoulder flexions on the ground and on 1-m-height-portable-elevated-platform. The surface EMG of trunk (lumbar extensor, and rectus abdominis) and lower limb (rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis) muscles during this task were recorded (1 kHz sampling frequency) and compared during these three phases. Analysis of variance was applied to compare the effects of height (floor and elevated platform), vision (open and closed), and postural adjustment (APA, OPA and CPA) into the activity of each muscle. These muscles were more active during OPA (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and less active during APA. On the elevated platform, these postural muscles presented more activty during APA (p&amp;lt;0.001). During the most stable condition (on the ground with eyes opened), muscle activity during APA and OPA was negatively correlated, and not correlated between OPA and CPA. Our results suggest postural control adapts to sensory, motor, and cognitive conditions. Therefore, the increased demand for postural control, generated due to the height of the support base, provokes the need for greater flexibility of postural synergies and causes a change in muscle activity.

Summary StatementWe discuss how postural muscle activity behaves before and after a fast upper arms movement when someone stands on a elevated platform or on the ground.</description>

	<description>Injury responses require communication between different cell types in the skin. Sensory neurons contribute to inflammation and can secrete signaling molecules that affect non-neuronal cells. Despite the pervasive role of translational regulation in nociception, the contribution of activity-dependent protein synthesis to inflammation is not well understood. To address this problem, we examined the landscape of nascent translation in DRG neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified the activity-dependent gene, Arc, as a target of privileged translation in vitro and in vivo. Inflammatory cues promote local translation of Arc in the skin. Arc deficient mice display exaggerated paw temperatures and vasodilation in response to an inflammatory challenge. Since Arc has recently been shown to be released from neurons in extracellular vesicles, we hypothesized that intercellular Arc signaling regulates the inflammatory response in skin. We found that the excessive thermal responses and vasodilation observed in Arc defective mice are rescued by injection of Arc-containing extracellular vesicles into the skin. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent production of Arc in afferent fibers regulates neurogenic inflammation through intercellular signaling.

	<description>In everyday life, we have no trouble recognizing and categorizing objects as they change in position, size, and orientation in our visual fields. This phenomenon is known as object invariance. Previous fMRI research suggests that higher-level object processing regions in the human lateral occipital cortex may link object responses from different affine states (i.e. size and viewpoint) through a general linear mapping function with the learned mapping capable of predicting responses of novel objects. In this study, we extended this approach to examine the mapping for both Euclidean (e.g. position and size) and non-Euclidean (e.g. image statistics and spatial frequency) transformations across the human ventral visual processing hierarchy, including areas V1, V2, V3, V4, ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOT), and lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOT). The predicted pattern generated from a linear mapping could capture a significant amount, but not all, of the variance of the true pattern across the ventral visual pathway. The derived linear mapping functions were not entirely category independent as performance was better for the categories included in the training. Moreover, prediction performance was not consistently better in higher than lower visual regions, nor were there notable differences between Euclidean and non-Euclidean transformations. Together, these findings demonstrate a near-orthogonal representation of object identity and non-identity features throughout the human ventral visual processing pathway, with the non-identity features largely untangled from the identity features early in the visual processing.

Significance StatementPresently we still do not fully understand how object identity and non-identity (e.g. position, size) information are simultaneously represented in the primate ventral visual system to form invariant representations. Previous work suggests that the human lateral occipital cortex may be linking different affine states of object representations through general linear mapping functions. Here we show that across the entire human ventral processing pathway, we could link object responses in different states of non-identity transformations through linear mapping functions for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transformations. These mapping functions are not identity-independent, suggesting that object identity and non-identity features are represented in a near, rather than a completely, orthogonal manner.</description>

	<description>Technological and data sharing advances have led to a proliferation of high-resolution structural and functional maps of the brain. Modern neuroimaging research increasingly depends on identifying correspondences between the topographies of these maps; however, most standard methods for statistical inference fail to account for their spatial properties. Recently, multiple methods have been developed to generate null distributions that preserve the spatial autocorrelation of brain maps and yield more accurate statistical estimates. Here, we comprehensively assess the performance of ten such published null frameworks in controlling the family-wise error rate in statistical analyses of parcellated neuroimaging data. We apply each framework on two prototypical analyses: (1) testing the correspondence between brain maps (e.g., correlating two activation maps) and (2) testing the spatial distribution of a feature within a partition (e.g., quantifying the specificity of an activation map within an intrinsic functional network). In agreement with previous reports, we find that naive null models that do not preserve spatial autocorrelation consistently yield unrealistically liberal statistical estimates. Performance of spatially-constrained null models depended on research context; model performance was generally consistent when testing correspondences between brain maps, but considerably more variable when testing partition specificity. Throughout these analyses, we observe minimal impact of parcellation and parcel resolution on null model performance. Altogether, our results highlight the need for continued development and standardization of statistically-rigorous methods for comparing brain maps.</description>

	<description>Replenishment of readily releasable synaptic vesicles (SVs) with vesicles in the recycling pool is important for sustained transmitter release during repetitive stimulation. Kinetics of replenishment and available pool size define synaptic performance. However, whether all SVs in the recycling pool are recruited for release with equal probability is unknown. Here, using comprehensive optical imaging for various presynaptic endosomal SNARE proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that part of the recycling pool bearing the endosomal Q-SNARE Syntaxin 7 (Stx7) is preferentially mobilized for release during high-frequency repetitive stimulation. Recruitment of the SV pool marked with the Stx7-reporter requires high intra-terminal Ca2+ concentrations and actin polymerization. Furthermore, disruption of Stx7 function by overexpressing the N-terminal domain selectively abolished this pool. Thus, our data indicate that endosomal membrane fusion involving Stx7 is essential for adaptation of synapses to respond high-frequency repetitive stimulation.</description>

	<description>The emergence of large-scale brain networks, and their continual refinement, represent crucial developmental processes that can drive individual differences in cognition and which are associated with multiple neurodevelopmental conditions. But how does this organization arise, and what mechanisms govern the diversity of these developmental processes? There are many existing descriptive theories, but to date none are computationally formalized. We provide a mathematical framework that specifies the growth of a brain network over developmental time. Within this framework macroscopic brain organization, complete with spatial embedding of its organization, is an emergent property of a generative wiring equation that optimizes its connectivity by renegotiating its biological costs and topological values continuously over development. The rules that govern these iterative wiring properties are controlled by a set of tightly framed parameters, with subtle differences in these parameters steering network growth towards different neurodiverse outcomes. Regional expression of genes associated with the developmental simulations converge on biological processes and cellular components predominantly involved in synaptic signaling, neuronal projection, catabolic intracellular processes and protein transport. Together, this provides a unifying computational framework for conceptualizing the mechanisms and diversity of childhood brain development, capable of integrating different levels of analysis - from genes to cognition.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Genotype networks of 80 quantitative &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes reveal phenotypic evolvability despite pervasive epistasis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Schweizer, Andreas Wagner&lt;/p&gt;

We study the genotype-phenotype maps of 80 quantitative phenotypes in the model plant &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, by representing the genotypes affecting each phenotype as a genotype network. In such a network, each vertex or node corresponds to an individual’s genotype at all those genomic loci that affect a given phenotype. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the associated genotypes differ in exactly one nucleotide. The 80 genotype networks we analyze are based on data from genome-wide association studies of 199 &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thaliana&lt;/i&gt; accessions. They form connected graphs whose topography differs substantially among phenotypes. We focus our analysis on the incidence of epistasis (non-additive interactions among mutations) because a high incidence of epistasis can reduce the accessibility of evolutionary paths towards high or low phenotypic values. We find epistatic interactions in 67 phenotypes, and in 51 phenotypes every pairwise mutant interaction is epistatic. Moreover, we find phenotype-specific differences in the fraction of accessible mutational paths to maximum phenotypic values. However, even though epistasis affects the accessibility of maximum phenotypic values, the relationships between genotypic and phenotypic change of our analyzed phenotypes are sufficiently smooth that some evolutionary paths remain accessible for most phenotypes, even where epistasis is pervasive. The genotype network representation we use can complement existing approaches to understand the genetic architecture of polygenic traits in many different organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OvgRp6w03Vg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of diagnosed fatal encephalitis in humans caused by the classical Borna disease virus (BoDV‐1) is increasingly recognized, ever since it was proven that BoDV‐1 can cause human infections. However, awareness for this entity is low and a specific imaging pattern has not yet been identified. We therefore provide the first comprehensive description on the morphology of human BoDV‐1 encephalitis with histopathological verification of imaging abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an institutional review board (IRB)‐approved multi‐center study, we retrospectively analyzed 55 MRI exams of 19 patients with confirmed BoDV‐1 encephalitis. Fifty brain regions were systematically analyzed (T1w, T2w, T2*w, T1w + Gd, DWI) in order to discern a specific inflammation pattern. Histopathological analysis of 25 locations of one patient served as correlation for MRI abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline imaging, acquired at a mean of 11 ± 10 days after symptom onset, as well as follow‐up scans of 16 patients revealed characteristic T2‐hyperintensities with predilection for the head of the caudate nucleus, insula and cortical spread to the limbic system, whereas occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres were unaffected. This gradient was confirmed by histology. Nine patients (47.4%) developed T1‐hyperintensities of the basal ganglia, corresponding to accumulated lipid phagocytes on histology and typical for late‐stage necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BoDV‐1 encephalitis shows a distinct inflammation pattern in both the early and late stages of the disease. Its appearance can mimic sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (sCJD) on MRI and should be considered a differential diagnosis in the case of atypical clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and overlap of entorhinal, premotor, and amygdalar connections in the monkey anterior cingulate cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32dec15c-737f-4364-9f38-f2a5bb8c9940/cne24986-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retrograde and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala), and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are more evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. These connection patterns are consistent with diverse roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar circuits suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Single-channel EEG features during n-back task correlate with working memory load. (arXiv:2008.04987v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04987</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04987</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working Memory (WM) load is an important cognitive feature that is highly
correlated with mental effort. Several neurological biomarkers such as theta
power and mid-frontal activity show increased activity with increasing WM load.
Such correlations often break down in cognitively impaired individuals, making
WM load biomarkers a valuable tool for the detection of cognitive impairment.
However, most studies have used a multi-channel EEG or an fMRI, which are not
massively accessible. In the present study, we evaluate the ability of novel
features extracted from a single-channel EEG located on the forehead, to serve
as markers of WM load. We employed the widely used n-back task to manipulate WM
load. Fourteen participants performed the n-back task while their brain
activity was recorded with the Neurosteer inc Aurora EEG device. The results
showed that the activity of the newly introduced features increased with WM
load, similar to the theta band, but exhibited higher sensitivity to finer WM
load changes. These more sensitive biomarkers of WM load are a promising tool
for mass screening of mild cognitive impairment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04978</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals exhibit remarkable feats of behavioral flexibility and
multifunctional control that remain challenging for robotic systems. The neural
and morphological basis of multifunctionality in animals can provide a source
of bio-inspiration for robotic controllers. However, many existing approaches
to modeling biological neural networks rely on computationally expensive models
and tend to focus solely on the nervous system, often neglecting the
biomechanics of the periphery. As a consequence, while these models are
excellent tools for neuroscience, they fail to predict functional behavior in
real time, which is a critical capability for robotic control. To meet the need
for real-time multifunctional control, we have developed a hybrid Boolean model
framework capable of modeling neural bursting activity and simple biomechanics
at speeds faster than real time. Using this approach, we present a
multifunctional model of Aplysia californica feeding that qualitatively
reproduces three key feeding behaviors (biting, swallowing, and rejection),
demonstrates behavioral switching in response to external sensory cues, and
incorporates both known neural connectivity and a simple bioinspired mechanical
model of the feeding apparatus. We demonstrate that the model can be used for
formulating testable hypotheses and discuss the implications of this approach
for robotic control and neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between complex, brain oscillations and the dynamics of
individual neurons is poorly understood. Here we utilize Maximum Caliber, a
dynamical inference principle, to build a minimal, yet general model of the
collective (mean-field) dynamics of large populations of neurons. In agreement
with previous experimental observations, we describe a simple, testable
mechanism, involving only a single type of neuron, by which many of these
complex oscillatory patterns may emerge. Our model predicts that the refractory
period of neurons, which has been previously neglected, is essential for these
behaviors.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Temporal-Coded Deep Spiking Neural Network with Easy Training and Robust Performance. (arXiv:1909.10837v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10837</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10837</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural network (SNN) is interesting both theoretically and
practically because of its strong bio-inspiration nature and potentially
outstanding energy efficiency. Unfortunately, its development has fallen far
behind the conventional deep neural network (DNN), mainly because of difficult
training and lack of widely accepted hardware experiment platforms. In this
paper, we show that a deep temporal-coded SNN can be trained easily and
directly over the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with testing
accuracy within 1% of the DNN of equivalent size and architecture. Training
becomes similar to DNN thanks to the closed-form solution to the spiking
waveform dynamics. Considering that SNNs should be implemented in practical
neuromorphic hardwares, we train the deep SNN with weights quantized to 8, 4, 2
bits and with weights perturbed by random noise to demonstrate its robustness
in practical applications. In addition, we develop a phase-domain signal
processing circuit schematic to implement our spiking neuron with 90% gain of
energy efficiency over existing work. This paper demonstrates that the
temporal-coded deep SNN is feasible for applications with high performance and
high energy efficient.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Renewed Perspectives on the Deep Roots and Broad Distribution of Animal Consciousness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of neurobiologists have long abandoned the Cartesian view of non-human animals as unconscious automatons—acknowledging instead the high likelihood that mammals and birds have mental experiences akin to subjective consciousness. Several lines of evidence are now extending those limits to all vertebrates and even some invertebrates, though graded in degrees as argued originally by Darwin, correlated with the complexity of the animal’s brain. A principal argument for this view is that the function of consciousness is to promote the survival of an animal—especially one actively moving about—in the face of dynamic changes and real-time contingencies. Cognitive ecologists point to the unique features of each animal’s environment and the specific behavioral capabilities that different environments invoke, thereby suggesting that consciousness must take on a great variety of forms, many of which differ substantially from human subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cortico-Striatal Oscillations Are Correlated to Motor Activity Levels in Both Physiological and Parkinsonian Conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00056</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillatory neural activity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical (CBGTC) loop is associated with the motor state of a subject, but also with the availability of modulatory neurotransmitters. For example, increased low-frequency oscillations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are related to decreased levels of dopamine and have been proposed as biomarkers to adapt and optimize therapeutic interventions, such as deep brain stimulation. Using neural oscillations as biomarkers require differentiating between changes in oscillatory patterns associated with parkinsonism vs. those related to a subject’s motor state. To address this point, we studied the correlation between neural oscillatory activity in the motor cortex and striatum and varying degrees of motor activity under normal and parkinsonian conditions. Using rats with bilateral or unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions as PD models, we correlated the motion index (MI)—a measure based on the physical acceleration of the head of rats—to the local field potential (LFP) oscillatory power in the 1–80 Hz range. In motor cortices and striata, we observed a robust correlation between the motion index and the oscillatory power in two main broad frequency ranges: a low-frequency range [5.0–26.5 Hz] was negatively correlated to motor activity, whereas a high-frequency range [35.0–79.9 Hz] was positively correlated. We observed these correlations in both normal and parkinsonian conditions. In addition to these general changes in broad-band power, we observed a more restricted narrow-band oscillation [25–40 Hz] in dopamine-denervated hemispheres. This oscillation, which seems to be selective to the parkinsonian state, showed a linear frequency dependence on the concurrent motor activity level. We conclude that, independently of the parkinsonian condition, changes in broad-band oscillatory activities of cortico-basal ganglia networks (including changes in the relative power of low- and high-frequency bands) are closely correlated to ongoing motions, most likely reflecting he operations of these neural circuits to control motor activity. Hence, biomarkers based on neural oscillations should focus on specific features, such as narrow frequency bands, to allow differentiation between parkinsonian states and physiological movement-dependent circuit modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Fixel Based Analysis Reveals Atypical White Matter Micro- and Macrostructure in Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Investigation of the Role of Biological Sex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00040</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00040</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Atypical white matter (WM) microstructure is commonly implicated in the neuropathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fixel based analysis (FBA), at the cutting-edge of diffusion-weighted imaging, can account for crossing WM fibers and can provide indices of both WM micro- and macrostructure. We applied FBA to investigate WM structure between 25 (12 males, 13 females) adults with ASD and 24 (12 males, 12 females) matched controls. As the role of biological sex on the neuropathophysiology of ASD is of increasing interest, this was also explored. There were no significant differences in WM micro- or macrostructure between adults with ASD and matched healthy controls. When data were stratified by sex, females with ASD had reduced fiber density and cross-section (FDC), a combined metric comprised of micro- and macrostructural measures, in the corpus callosum, a finding not detected between the male sub-groups. We conclude that micro- and macrostructural WM aberrations are present in ASD, and may be influenced by biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Retinal Functional and Structural Changes in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00862</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00862</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the aberrant deposition of protein in the brain and is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Increasingly, there have been reports of the presence of these protein hallmarks in the retina. In this study, we assayed the retina of 5xFAD mice, a transgenic model of amyloid deposition known to exhibit dementia-like symptoms with age. Using OCT, we found that the retinal nerve fiber layer was thinner in 5xFAD at 6, 12, and 17 months of age compared with wild-type littermates, but the inner plexiform layer was thicker at 6 months old. Retinal function showed reduced ganglion cell responses to light in 5xFAD at 6, 12, and 17 months of age. This functional loss was observed in the outer retina at 17 months of age but not in younger mice. We showed using immunohistochemistry and ELISA that soluble and insoluble amyloid was present in the retina and brain at all ages. In conclusion, we report that amyloid is present in brain and retina of 5xFAD mice and that the pattern of neuronal dysfunction occurs in the inner retina at the early ages and progresses to encompass the outer retina with age. This implies that the inner retina is more sensitive to amyloid changes in early disease and that the outer retina is also affected with disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Conductive Hearing Loss Aggravates Memory Decline in Alzheimer Model Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study of cognitive impairment associated with hearing loss has recently garnered considerable interest. Epidemiological data have demonstrated that hearing loss is a risk factor for cognitive decline as a result of aging. However, no previous study has examined the effect of hearing loss in patients with cognitive problems such as Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, we investigated the effect of conductive hearing loss in an Alzheimer’s mouse model. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to evaluate changes in glucose metabolism and gray matter concentrations in the 5xFAD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) transgenic mouse model with and without conductive hearing loss (HL). Conductive hearing loss was induced using chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane. Behavioral data from the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests revealed greater memory deficits in the AD with HL (AD-HL) group than in the AD group. Following induction of hearing loss, lower cerebral glucose metabolism in the frontal association cortex was observed in the AD-HL group than in the AD group. Although lower glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and cerebellum was found in the AD-HL group than in the AD group at 3 months, the gray matter concentrations in these regions were not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, the gray matter concentrations in the simple lobule, cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, substantia nigra, retrosigmoid nucleus, medial geniculate nucleus, and anterior pretectal nucleus at 7 months were significantly lower in the AD-HL group than in the AD group. Taken together, these results indicate that even partial hearing loss can aggravate memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Evaluation of Glymphatic System Using Diffusion MR Technique in T2DM Cases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00300</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00300</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to evaluate the activity of the human glymphatic system in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using diffusion tensor image analysis along with the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion tensor images were acquired to calculate the diffusivities in the direction of the x-axis (right-to-left; Dx), y-axis (anterior-to-posterior; Dy), and z-axis (inferior-to-superior; Dz) of the plane of the lateral ventricle body in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and 10 people in a control group. We evaluated the diffusivity along with the perivascular spaces, as well as the projection fibers and association fibers, separately. The analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS-index) was defined as the mean (Dxpro, Dypro)/mean (Dypro, Dzasc), where the Dxpro and Dxasc were the Dx values in the projection and association fiber areas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were significant differences in diffusivity along the projection fibers and the association fibers among the groups. The significant differences among the groups along the perivascular spaces, shown as the ALPS-index and medical history of T2DM, indicating lower water diffusivity along the perivascular space concerning type 2 diabetes severity, was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Lower diffusivity along the perivascular space on DTI-APLS can reflect impairment of the glymphatic system in T2DM. This study showed that the activity of the glymphatic system could be evaluated by diffusion tensor image analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Interactions Between Motor Thalamic Field Potentials and Single-Unit Spiking Are Correlated With Behavior in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Field potential (FP) oscillations are believed to coordinate brain activity over large spatiotemporal scales, with specific features (e.g., phase and power) in discrete frequency bands correlated with motor output. Furthermore, complex correlations between oscillations in distinct frequency bands (phase-amplitude, amplitude-amplitude, and phase-phase coupling) are commonly observed. However, the mechanisms underlying FP-behavior correlations and cross-frequency coupling remain unknown. The thalamus plays a central role in generating many circuit-level neural oscillations, and single-unit activity in motor thalamus (Mthal) is correlated with behavioral output. We, therefore, hypothesized that motor thalamic spiking coordinates motor system FPs and underlies FP-behavior correlations. To investigate this possibility, we recorded wideband motor thalamic (Mthal) electrophysiology as healthy rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. Delta (1–4 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), low gamma (30–70 Hz), and high gamma (70–200 Hz) power were strongly modulated by task performance. As in the cortex, the delta phase was correlated with beta/low gamma power and reaction time. Most interestingly, subpopulations of Mthal neurons defined by their relationship to the behavior exhibited distinct relationships with FP features. Specifically, neurons whose activity was correlated with action selection and movement speed were entrained to delta oscillations. Furthermore, changes in their activity anticipated power fluctuations in beta/low gamma bands. These complex relationships suggest mechanisms for commonly observed FP-FP and spike-FP correlations, as well as subcortical influences on motor output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: In silico Hierarchical Clustering of Neuronal Populations in the Rat Ventral Tegmental Area Based on Extracellular Electrophysiological Properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00051</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00051</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a heterogeneous brain region, containing different neuronal populations. During in vivo recordings, electrophysiological characteristics are classically used to distinguish the different populations. However, the VTA is also considered as a region harboring neurons with heterogeneous properties. In the present study, we aimed to classify VTA neurons using in silico approaches, in an attempt to determine if homogeneous populations could be extracted. Thus, we recorded 291 VTA neurons during in vivo extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats. Initially, 22 neurons with high firing rates (&amp;gt;10 Hz) and short-lasting action potentials (AP) were considered as a separate subpopulation, in light of previous studies. To segregate the remaining 269 neurons, presumably dopaminergic (DA), we performed in silico analyses, using a combination of different electrophysiological parameters. These parameters included: (1) firing rate; (2) firing rate coefficient of variation (CV); (3) percentage of spikes in a burst; (4) AP duration; (5) Δt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; duration (i.e., time from initiation of depolarization until end of repolarization); and (6) presence of a notched AP waveform. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two neuronal populations that differed in their bursting activities. The largest population presented low bursting activities (&amp;lt;17.5% of total spikes in burst), while the remaining neurons presented higher bursting activities (&amp;gt;17.5%). Within non-high-firing neurons, a large heterogeneity was noted concerning AP characteristics. In conclusion, this analysis based on conventional electrophysiological criteria clustered two subpopulations of putative DA VTA neurons that are distinguishable by their firing patterns (firing rates and bursting activities) but not their AP properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Elamipretide Attenuates Pyroptosis and Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders in Aged Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00251</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00251</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a recently characterized inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Elamipretide (SS-31), a mitochondrial-targeted peptide with multiple pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory activity, has been demonstrated to protect against many neurological diseases. However, the effect of elamipretide on pyroptosis in PND has not been studied. We established an animal model of PND by performing an exploratory laparotomy on mice under isoflurane anesthesia and examined the effects of elamipretide on cognitive function, synaptic integrity, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and signaling controlling pyroptosis. Our results showed that anesthesia and surgery caused mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal morphology, activation of canonicalnod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis, and downregulation of synaptic integrity-related proteins in the hippocampus in aged mice, thus leading to learning and memory deficits in behavioral tests. Remarkably, treatment with the mitochondrial-targeted peptide elamipretide not only had protective effects against mitochondrial dysfunction but also attenuated surgery-induced pyroptosis and cognitive deficits. Our results provide a promising strategy for the treatment of PND involving mitochondrial dysfunction and pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microglia Gone Awry: Linking Immunometabolism to Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related chronic inflammatory activation of microglia and their dysfunction are observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, and the potential contributions of these dysfunctional cells to neurodegeneration have been demonstrated recently. The housekeeping and defensive functions of microglia, such as surveying the brain parenchyma and phagocytosis of neuronal debris after injury, are important for brain homeostasis and immunity. During neurodegenerative diseases, loss of these functions can promote disease pathology by producing proinflammatory cytokines and increasing oxidative stress, which can exaggerate the ongoing neuroinflammation. A recent surge in microglial research has unraveled myriads of microglial phenotypes associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to the conventional M1/M2 paradigm. Each of these phenotypes can be characterized by distinct transcriptional profiles as well as altered metabolism, migration, and phagocytosis characteristics. Mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) and granulin (GRN) are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, and these genes are dysregulated in the majority of recently identified microglial phenotypes. These genes act as checkpoint regulators and maintain microglial inflammatory fitness, principally through metabolic modulation. Dysfunctional microglia typically show mitochondrial deficits, glycolysis elevation, and lipid droplet accumulation, which results in reduced migration and phagocytosis and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion and reactive oxygen species release. In this mini-review article, we discuss the existing data regarding metabolic perturbations in dysfunctional microglia and their documented associations with neurodegeneration, highlighting how aging-induced chronic microglial activation alters microglial bioenergetics, leading to impaired homeostatic and housekeeping functions. Dysfunctional microglia initiate or exacerbate neurodegeneration, and key pathways involved in the dysfunctional processes, including metabolism, may represent potential intervention targets for correcting imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced during abnormal and normal physiological conditions. Understanding the expression profile of microRNA (miRNA) in plasma-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their roles in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that cause cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g) were allocated to sham or SAH groups established using endovascular perforation method. miRNA expression profiles of plasma sEVs in both groups (each n = 4) were evaluated using next-generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 142 microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly expressed differently between the two groups, of which 73 were up-regulated while 69 were down-regulated in SAH sEVs compared with those of sham (p &amp;lt; 0.05; fold change ≥ 2). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of differently expressed (DE) miRNAs revealed signaling pathways and target genes (TGs) in the SAH group. rno-miR-185-5p, rno-miR-103-3p, rno-miR-15b-3p, rno-miR-93-5p, and rno-miR-98-5p were the top five most up-regulated sEVs miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that miRNA can be selectively packaged into sEVs under SAH, and this could help develop potential targets for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVS after this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: CCR2 Inhibition Reduces Neurotoxic Microglia Activation Phenotype After Japanese Encephalitis Viral Infection</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Controlling the proinflammatory response of microglia by targeting chemokines (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) could be an important therapeutic approach for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Here, through JEV infection to BV2 microglia and young BALB/c mice, we investigated that CCR2 is highly upregulated after JEV infection and plays a key role in determining microglia activation phenotype and associated with neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators of TNF-α and IFNγ. In addition, we found JEV infection to BV2 microglia causes an increase in microglial proliferation and cell body area at day 1 and day 3. Using the agonist molecule of CCR2 inhibition; RS102895, significantly reduces microglia reactive phenotype and nitric oxide production. Further, to define the role of CCR2 in functional responses of microglia and their activation phenotype, we performed in vitro cell scratch functional assay and ImageJ analysis. When compared with control, microglia cells showed a significant increase in elongated or rod-like activated phenotype in JEV-infected cells at 24 h post-infection and CCR2 inhibition significantly reduced the elongated activation phenotype induced by JEV infection, suggesting that CCR2 acts as a critical regulator for microglia activation phenotype after JEV infection. We found that JEV-infected mice treated with RS102895 had less microglia activation and reduced mRNA expression of CCR2 and proinflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ in cortical tissue. Collectively, our data indicate that CCR2 drives reactive phenotype of microglia and its inhibition reduces microglia activation and neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators after JEV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Studying Abnormal Chromosomal Diseases Using Patient-Derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00224</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chromosomal abnormality causes congenital and acquired intractable diseases. In general, there are no fundamental treatments for these diseases. To establish platforms to develop therapeutics for these diseases, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are highly beneficial. To study abnormal chromosomal diseases, it is often hard to apply animal disease models because the chromosomal structures are variable among species. It is also difficult to apply simple genome editing technology in cells or individuals for abnormal chromosomes. Thus, these patient-derived iPSCs have advantages for developing disease models with multiple cell and tissue types, which are typically seen in the symptoms of abnormal chromosomal diseases. Here we review the studies of patient-derived iPSCs carrying abnormal chromosomes, focusing on pluripotent state and neural lineages. We also discuss the technological advances in chromosomal manipulations toward establishing experimental models and future therapeutics. Patient-derived iPSCs carrying chromosomal abnormality are valuable as cellular bioresources since they can indefinitely proliferate and provide various cell types. Also, these findings and technologies are important for future studies on elucidating pathogenesis, drug development, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy for abnormal chromosomal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Microglia Dystrophy Following Binge-Like Alcohol Exposure in Adolescent and Adult Male Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00052</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic cells that have roles in neuronal plasticity as well as in recovery responses following neuronal injury. Although many hypothesize that hyperactivation of microglia contributes to alcohol-induced neuropathology, in other neurodegenerative conditions disruption of normal microglial processes also contributes to neuronal loss, particularly as microglia become dystrophic or dysfunctional. Based on the observation of a striking, abnormal morphology in microglia during binge-like ethanol exposure, the present study investigated the impact of excessive ethanol exposure on microglia number and dystrophic morphology in a model of alcohol dependence that includes neurodegeneration in both adult and adolescent rats. Following 2- and 4-day binge ethanol exposure, the number of microglia was decreased in the hippocampus and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of both adult and adolescent rats. Furthermore, a significant number of microglia with a dystrophic morphology were observed in ethanol-exposed tissue, accompanied by a significant decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. Together these findings suggest another means by which microglia may contribute to alcohol-induced neurodegeneration, specifically dystrophic microglia and/or loss of microglia may disrupt homeostatic and recovery mechanisms. These results demonstrate that microglia also degenerate with excessive alcohol exposure, which has important implications for understanding the role of microglia—and specifically their contributions to plasticity and neuronal survival—in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Transcriptome Analyses in BV2 Microglial Cells Following Treatment With Amino-Terminal Fragments of Apolipoprotein E</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00256</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00256</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that harboring the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele represents the single greatest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the exact mechanism by which ApoE4 contributes to disease progression remains unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that a 151 amino-terminal fragment of ApoE4 (nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;) localizes within the nucleus of microglia in the human AD brain and traffics to the nucleus causing toxicity in BV2 microglia cells. In the present study, we examined in detail what genes may be affected following treatment by nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;. Transcriptome analyses in BV2 microglial cells following sublethal treatment with nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; revealed the upregulation of almost 4,000 genes, with 20 of these genes upregulated 182- to 715-fold compared to untreated control cells. The majority of these 20 genes play a role in the immune response and polarization toward microglial M1 activation. As a control, an identical nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; fragment that differed by a single amino acid at position 112 (Cys→Arg) was tested and produced a similar albeit lower level of upregulation of an identical set of genes. In this manner, enriched pathways upregulated by nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; and nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; following exogenous treatment included Toll receptor signaling, chemokine/cytokine signaling and apoptosis signaling. There were unique genes differentially expressed by at least two-fold for either fragment. For nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;, these included 16 times as many genes, many of which are involved in physiological functions within microglia. For nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;, on the other hand the number genes uniquely upregulated was significantly lower, with many of the top upregulated genes having unknown functions. Taken together, our results suggest that while nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; may serve a more physiological role in microglia, nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; may activate genes that contribute to disease inflammation associated with AD. These data support the hypothesis that the link between harboring the APOE4 allele and dementia risk could be enhanced inflammation through activation of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Nicotinamide, a Poly [ADP-Ribose] Polymerase 1 (PARP-1) Inhibitor, as an Adjunctive Therapy for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00255</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00255</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) is a key component in the cellular production of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and has long been associated with neuronal development, survival and death. Numerous data suggest that nicotinamide may offer therapeutic benefits in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Beyond its effect in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stores, nicotinamide is an inhibitor of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), an enzyme with multiple cellular functions, including regulation of cell death, energy/metabolism and inflammatory response. PARP-1 functions as a DNA repair enzyme but under intense DNA damage depletes the cell of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ATP and leads to a non-apoptotic type of cell death called Parthanatos, which has been associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; availability might potentially improve mitochondrial function, which is severely impaired in AD. PARP-1 inhibition may also exert a protective effect against neurodegeneration by its action to diminish neuroinflammation and microglial activation which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we discuss the evidence supporting the use of nicotinamide as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of early stages of AD based on the inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on PARP-1 activity. The data support evaluating nicotinamide as an adjunctive treatment for AD at early stages of the disease not only to increase NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stores but as a PARP-1 inhibitor, raising the hypothesis that other PARP-1 inhibitors – drugs that are already approved for breast cancer treatment – might be explored for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Distinct Relationship Between Cognitive Flexibility and White Matter Integrity in Individuals at Risk of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00250</guid>

	<description>Background and Objective&lt;p&gt;Executive dysfunction is the most common cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD), occurring even in its early stages. In our study, we applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity and its association with a specific executive function such as cognitive flexibility in individuals with risk factors for PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined 50 individuals with risk factors for developing PD and 24 healthy controls from the TREND (Tübinger Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study including neuropsychological evaluation and DTI. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the trail making test (TMT). Tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) were employed to assess white matter abnormalities and their correlation with cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;TMT performance correlated with mean and axial diffusivity in several white matter regions, predominantly in the frontoparietal white matter. These effects were stronger in PD risk persons (PD-RP) than in controls as evidenced by a significant group interaction. White matter integrity and TMT performance did not significantly differ across groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Based on our results, PD-RP do no exhibit white matter changes or impaired cognitive flexibility. However, specific executive functions in PD-RP are more related to white matter alterations than in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Attention and Functional Connectivity Among Patients With Early-Stage Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00239</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00239</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current study compared attention profiles and functional connectivity of frontal regions in patients with early-stage subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty patients with SIVD, 32 patients with AD, and 23 subjects with normal cognition (NC) received cognition and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) evaluations. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was used to assess global cognition, and simple attention, processing speed, divided attention, and vigilance/sustained attention were evaluated using the Digit Span Forward, Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modality Test, and Conners Continuous Performance Test, respectively. Voxel-based regional homogeneity (ReHo) derived from rs-fMRI data was analyzed to identify significant clusters, which were further correlated with attention profiles. Although the patients with SIVD and AD had comparable global cognitive ability, those with SIVD exhibited worse divided attention and vigilance/sustained attention than those with AD. Compared with the NC group, the patients with SIVD exhibited decreased ReHo within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), whereas the patients with AD exhibited increased ReHo within the right orbital part of frontal regions. Correlations between these three clusters with attention exhibited distinct patterns according to the dementia subtype, as did attention indices with significance in predicting global cognition. In summary, our study suggested that worse attention performance was associated with functional disconnection within the frontal regions among patients with SIVD than in those with AD. Frontal functional disconnection may underlie the pathogenesis responsible for defective divided attention, vigilance/sustained attention, and notable within-group variations identified in SIVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Early analysis of the Australian COVID-19 epidemic</title>

	<description>As of 1 May 2020, there had been 6,808 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia. Of these, 98 had died from the disease. The epidemic had been in decline since mid-March, with 308 cases confirmed nationally since 14 April. This suggests that the collective actions of the Australian public and government authorities in response to COVID-19 were sufficiently early and assiduous to avert a public health crisis — for now. Analysing factors that contribute to individual country experiences of COVID-19, such as the intensity and timing of public health interventions, will assist in the next stage of response planning globally. We describe how the epidemic and public health response unfolded in Australia up to 13 April. We estimate that the effective reproduction number was likely below 1 in each Australian state since mid-March and forecast that clinical demand would remain below capacity thresholds over the forecast period (from mid-to-late April).</description>

	<title>eLife: Atypical meiosis can be adaptive in outcrossed Schizosaccharomyces pombe due to wtf meiotic drivers</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57936</link>
	<description>Killer meiotic drivers are genetic parasites that destroy ‘sibling’ gametes lacking the driver allele. The fitness costs of drive can lead to selection of unlinked suppressors. This suppression could involve evolutionary tradeoffs that compromise gametogenesis and contribute to infertility. &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;, an organism containing numerous gamete (spore)-killing &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; drivers, offers a tractable system to test this hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that in scenarios analogous to outcrossing, &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; drivers generate a fitness landscape in which atypical spores, such as aneuploids and diploids, are advantageous. In this context, &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; drivers can decrease the fitness costs of mutations that disrupt meiotic fidelity and, in some circumstances, can even make such mutations beneficial. Moreover, we find that &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt; isolates vary greatly in their ability to make haploid spores, with some isolates generating up to 46% aneuploid or diploid spores. This work empirically demonstrates the potential for meiotic drivers to shape the evolution of gametogenesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Plasticity and evolutionary convergence in the locomotor skeleton of Greater Antillean Anolis lizards</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57468</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57468</link>
	<description>Plasticity can put evolution on repeat if development causes species to generate similar morphologies in similar environments. &lt;i&gt;Anolis&lt;/i&gt; lizards offer the opportunity to put this role of developmental plasticity to the test. Following colonization of the four Greater Antillean islands, &lt;i&gt;Anolis&lt;/i&gt; lizards independently and repeatedly evolved six ecomorphs adapted to manoeuvring different microhabitats. By quantifying the morphology of the locomotor skeleton of 95 species, we demonstrate that ecomorphs on different islands have diverged along similar trajectories. However, microhabitat-induced morphological plasticity differed between species and did not consistently improve individual locomotor performance. Consistent with this decoupling between morphological plasticity and locomotor performance, highly plastic features did not show greater evolvability, and plastic responses to microhabitat were poorly aligned with evolutionary divergence between ecomorphs. The locomotor skeleton of &lt;i&gt;Anolis&lt;/i&gt; may have evolved within a subset of possible morphologies that are highly accessible through genetic change, enabling adaptive convergence independently of plasticity.</description>

	<description>Chronic pain remains challenging to both diagnose and treat. These challenges, in part, arise from limited systems-level understanding of the basic mechanisms that process nociceptive information and ultimately instantiate a subjectively available experience of pain. Here, I provide a framework, the distributed nociceptive system, for understanding nociceptive mechanisms at a systems level by integrating the concepts of neural population coding with distributed processing. Within this framework, wide-spread engagement of populations of neurons produces representations of nociceptive information that are highly resilient to disruption.</description>

	<description>Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular clearance pathway in which cytoplasmic contents are trafficked to the lysosome for degradation. Within neurons, it helps to remove damaged organelles and misfolded or aggregated proteins and has therefore been the subject of intense research in relation to neurodegenerative disease. However, far less is understood about the role of autophagy in other aspects of neuronal physiology. Here we review the literature on the role of autophagy in maintaining neuronal stem cells and in neuronal plasticity in adult life and we discuss how these contribute to structural and functional deficits observed in a range of human disorders.</description>

Many cognitive processes involve transformations of distributed representations in neural populations, creating a need for population-level models. Recurrent neural network models fulfill this need, but there are many open questions about how their connectivity gives rise to dynamics that solve a task. Here, we present a method for finding the connectivity of networks for which the dynamics are specified to solve a task in an interpretable way. We apply our method to a working memory task by synthesizing a network that implements a drift-diffusion process over a ring-shaped manifold. We also use our method to demonstrate how inputs can be used to control network dynamics for cognitive flexibility and explore the relationship between representation geometry and network capacity. Our work fits within the broader context of understanding neural computations as dynamics over relatively low-dimensional manifolds formed by correlated patterns of neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iEhpglNKGpY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b9806c5d-c279-4a1d-88fc-14deed7079ae/cne25006-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease ‐ a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and non‐spatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the Lafora disease mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the EPM2A or the NHLRC1 gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and cortical layer V of the Epm2a or Nhlrc1 knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and non‐spatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1‐to‐2 months) as well as the older (7‐to‐8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denotes that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25 to 300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 h after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ec975b8e-c06e-4b6b-b5d2-e3fb97ae734a/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of  muscle cells. In Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase
the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen – probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus&lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The SNARE Regulator Complexin3 is a Target of the Cone Circadian Clock</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The SNARE Regulator Complexin3 is a Target of the Cone Circadian Clock&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b922640-cb86-45a0-b150-d6d276e878bc/cne25004-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knock out cones (cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and wild type cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Complexin3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt;), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in wild type cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4‐‐&lt;/i&gt;the other complexin expressed in cones‐‐ were similar in wild type and mutant cones; in wild type cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt; and none upstream of exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04703</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the essential aspects of power system planning is generation expansion
planning (GEP). The purpose of GEP is to enhance construction planning and
reduce the costs of installing different types of power plants. This paper
proposes a method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) for GEP in the presence of
wind power plants. Since it is desired to integrate the maximum possible wind
power production in GEP, the constraints for incorporating different levels of
wind energy in power generation are investigated comprehensively. This will
allow obtaining the maximum reasonable amount of wind penetration in the
network. Besides, due to the existence of different wind regimes, the
penetration of strong and weak wind on GEP is assessed. The results show that
the maximum utilization of wind power generation capacity could increase the
exploitation of more robust wind regimes. Considering the growth of the wind
farm industry and the cost reduction for building wind power plants, the
sensitivity of GEP to the variations of this cost is investigated. The results
further indicate that for a 10% reduction in the initial investment cost of
wind power plants, the proposed model estimates that the overall cost will be
minimized.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite recent progress in robot learning, it still remains a challenge to
program a robot to deal with open-ended object manipulation tasks. One approach
that was recently used to autonomously generate a repertoire of diverse skills
is a novelty based Quality-Diversity~(QD) algorithm. However, as most
evolutionary algorithms, QD suffers from sample-inefficiency and, thus, it is
challenging to apply it in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles this
problem by integrating a neural network that predicts the behavior of the
perturbed parameters into a novelty based QD algorithm. In the proposed
Model-based Quality-Diversity search (M-QD), the network is trained
concurrently to the repertoire and is used to avoid executing unpromising
actions in the novelty search process. Furthermore, it is used to adapt the
skills of the final repertoire in order to generalize the skills to different
scenarios. Our experiments show that enhancing a QD algorithm with such a
forward model improves the sample-efficiency and performance of the
evolutionary process and the skill adaptation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04470</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural network applications generally benefit from larger-sized models, but
for current speech enhancement models, larger scale networks often suffer from
decreased robustness to the variety of real-world use cases beyond what is
encountered in training data. We introduce several innovations that lead to
better large neural networks for speech enhancement. The novel PoCoNet
architecture is a convolutional neural network that, with the use of
frequency-positional embeddings, is able to more efficiently build
frequency-dependent features in the early layers. A semi-supervised method
helps increase the amount of conversational training data by pre-enhancing
noisy datasets, improving performance on real recordings. A new loss function
biased towards preserving speech quality helps the optimization better match
human perceptual opinions on speech quality. Ablation experiments and objective
and human opinion metrics show the benefits of the proposed improvements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the activity of large populations of neurons is difficult due
to the combinatorial complexity of possible cell-cell interactions. To reduce
the complexity, coarse-graining had been previously applied to experimental
neural recordings, which showed over two decades of scaling in free energy,
activity variance, eigenvalue spectra, and correlation time, hinting that the
mouse hippocampus operates in a critical regime. We model the experiment by
simulating conditionally independent binary neurons coupled to a small number
of long-timescale stochastic fields and then replicating the coarse-graining
procedure and analysis. This reproduces the experimentally-observed scalings,
suggesting that they may arise from coupling the neural population activity to
latent dynamic stimuli. Further, parameter sweeps for our model suggest that
emergence of scaling requires most of the cells in a population to couple to
the latent stimuli, predicting that even the celebrated place cells must also
respond to non-place stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Creativity, or the ability to produce new useful ideas, is commonly
associated to the human being, but there are many other examples in nature
where this phenomenon can be observed. Inspired by this fact, in engineering
and particularly in computational sciences, many different models have been
developed to tackle a number of problems. Music, a form of art broadly present
along the human history, is the main field addressed in this thesis, taking
advantage of the kind of ideas that bring diversity and creativity to nature
and computation. We present Melomics, an algorithmic composition method based
on evolutionary search, with a genetic encoding of the solutions that are
interpreted in a complex developmental process that leads to music in standard
formats. This bioinspired compositional system has exhibited a highly creative
power and versatility to produce music of different type, which in many
occasions has proven to be indistinguishable from the music made by human
composers. The system also has enabled the emergence of a set of completely
novel applications: from effective tools that help anyone to easily obtain the
precise music they need, to radically new uses like adaptive music for therapy,
amusement or many other purposes. It is clear to us that there is yet much
research to be done in this field and that countless and new unimaginable uses
will derive from it.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in deep learning have led to state-of-the-art performance across a
multitude of speech recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the widespread deployment
of deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition remains a challenge,
particularly in edge scenarios where the memory and computing resources are
highly constrained (e.g., low-power embedded devices) or where the memory and
computing budget dedicated to speech recognition is low (e.g., mobile devices
performing numerous tasks besides speech recognition). In this study, we
introduce the concept of attention condensers for building low-footprint,
highly-efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition on the
edge. More specifically, an attention condenser is a self-attention mechanism
that learns and produces a condensed embedding characterizing joint local and
cross-channel activation relationships, and performs adaptive activation
recalibration accordingly for selective concentration. To illustrate its
efficacy, we introduce TinySpeech, low-precision deep neural networks
comprising largely of attention condensers tailored for on-device speech
recognition using a machine-driven design exploration strategy. Experimental
results on the Google Speech Commands benchmark dataset for limited-vocabulary
speech recognition showed that TinySpeech networks achieved significantly lower
architectural complexity (as much as $207\times$ fewer parameters) and lower
computational complexity (as much as $21\times$ fewer multiply-add operations)
when compared to previous deep neural networks in research literature. These
results not only demonstrate the efficacy of attention condensers for building
highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition, but
also illuminate its potential for accelerating deep learning on the edge and
empowering a wide range of TinyML applications.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene-Editing Technologies Paired With Viral Vectors for Translational Research Into Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) have historically been among the most difficult to treat using conventional pharmacological approaches. This is due to a confluence of factors, including the limited regenerative capacity and overall complexity of the brain, problems associated with repeated drug administration, and difficulties delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Viral-mediated gene transfer represents an attractive alternative for the delivery of therapeutic cargo to the nervous system. Crucially, it usually requires only a single injection, whether that be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or the delivery of a genome- or epigenome-modifying construct for treatment of CNS diseases and disorders. It is thus understandable that considerable effort has been put towards the development of improved vector systems for gene transfer into the CNS. Different viral vectors are of course tailored to their specific applications, but they generally should share several key properties. The ideal viral vector incorporates a high-packaging capacity, efficient gene transfer paired with robust and sustained expression, lack of oncogenicity, toxicity and pathogenicity, and scalable manufacturing for clinical applications. In this review, we will devote attention to viral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (lentiviral vectors; LVs) and adeno-associated virus (AAVs). The high interest in these viral delivery systems vectors is due to: (i) robust delivery and long-lasting expression; (ii) efficient transduction into postmitotic cells, including the brain; (iii) low immunogenicity and toxicity; and (iv) compatibility with advanced manufacturing techniques. Here, we will outline basic aspects of LV and AAV biology, particularly focusing on approaches and techniques aiming to enhance viral safety. We will also allocate a significant portion of this review to the development and use of LVs and AAVs for delivery into the CNS, with a focus on the genome and epigenome-editing tools based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas 9) and the development of novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Profile of MIF in Developing Hippocampus: Association With Cell Proliferation and Neurite Outgrowth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional cytokine and has been found involved in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Previous studies have shown that MIF is expressed in neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord in adult mice. It is expressed by astrocytes and activates microglias in neuroinflammation. Further studies have shown that MIF is detected in moss fibers of dentate granule cells and in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in adult hippocampus. Only NeuroD-positive immature granule neurons but not NeuN-positive mature neurons express MIF. These findings led us eager to know the exact role of MIF in the development of hippocampus. Therefore, we systematically checked the spatial and temporal expression pattern of MIF and characterized MIF-positive cells in hippocampus from mice aged from postnatal day 0 (P0) to 3 months. Our results showed that the lowest level of MIF protein occurred at P7 and mif mRNA increased from P0, reached a peak at P7, and stably expressed until P30 before declining dramatically at 3 months. MIF was localized in fibers of GFAP- and BLBP-positive radial glial precursor cells in dentate gyrus (DG). DCX-expressing newly generated neurons were MIF-negative. Inhibition of MIF by MIF antagonist S, R-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) reduced BrdU-positive cells. Interestingly, MIF was expressed by NeuN-positive GABAergic interneurons including parvalbumin-and Reelin-expressing cells in the DG. Neither NeuN-positive granule cells nor NeuN-positive pyramidal neurons expressed MIF. In transgenic mice, POMC-EGFP–positive immature dentate granule cells and Thy1-EGFP–positive mature granule cells were MIF-negative. Treatment of neuronal cultures with ISO-1 inhibited neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we conclude that MIF might be important for feature maintenance of neural stem cells and neurite outgrowth during hippocampal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gut Metabolite TMAO Induces Synaptic Plasticity Deficits by Promoting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00138</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is strongly associated with metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies indicate that Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbe-dependent metabolite is implicated in the development of age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms of the impact of TMAO on neuronal function has not been elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between TMAO and deficits in synaptic plasticity in an Alzheimer’s model (3×Tg-AD) and insulin resistance (Leptin deficient db/db) mouse by measuring plasma and brain levels of TMAO. We observed increased TMAO levels in the plasma and brain of both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice in comparison to wild-type mice. Besides, TMAO levels further increased as mice progressed in age. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, in the form of reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), were noted in both groups of mice in comparison to wild-type mice. To further explore the impact of TMAO on neuronal function, we utilized an ex-vivo model by incubating wild-type hippocampal brain slices with TMAO and found impaired synaptic transmission. We observed that TMAO induced the PERK-EIF2α-ER stress signaling axis in TMAO treated ex-vivo slices as well as in both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice. Lastly, we also observed altered presynaptic and reduced postsynaptic receptor expression. Our findings suggest that TMAO may induce deficits in synaptic plasticity through the ER stress-mediated PERK signaling pathway. Our results offer novel insight into the mechanism by which TMAO may induce cognitive deficits by promoting ER stress and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: P2X7 Receptor-Dependent microRNA Expression Profile in the Brain Following Status Epilepticus in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00127</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ionotropic ATP-gated P2X7 receptor is an important contributor to inflammatory signaling cascades via the release of Interleukin-1β, as well as having roles in cell death, neuronal plasticity and the release of neurotransmitters. Accordingly, there is interest in targeting the P2X7 receptor for the treatment of epilepsy. However, the signaling pathways downstream of P2X7 receptor activation remain incompletely understood. Notably, recent studies showed that P2X7 receptor expression is controlled, in part, by microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explored P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNA expression by comparing microRNA expression profiles of wild-type (wt) and P2X7 receptor knockout mice before and after status epilepticus. Genome-wide microRNA profiling was performed using hippocampi from wt and P2X7 receptor knockout mice following status epilepticus induced by intra-amygdala kainic acid. This revealed that the genetic deletion of the P2X7 receptor results in distinct patterns of microRNA expression. Specifically, we found that in vehicle-injected control mice, the lack of the P2X7 receptor resulted in the up-regulation of 50 microRNAs and down-regulation of 35 microRNAs. Post-status epilepticus, P2X7 receptor deficiency led to the up-regulation of 44 microRNAs while 13 microRNAs were down-regulated. Moreover, there was only limited overlap among identified P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs between control conditions and post-status epilepticus, suggesting that the P2X7 receptor regulates the expression of different microRNAs during normal physiology and pathology. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that genes targeted by P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs were particularly overrepresented in pathways involved in intracellular signaling, inflammation, and cell death; processes that have been repeatedly associated with P2X7 receptor activation. Moreover, whereas genes involved in signaling pathways and inflammation were common among up- and down-regulated P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs during physiological and pathological conditions, genes associated with cell death seemed to be restricted to up-regulated microRNAs during both physiological conditions and post-status epilepticus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the P2X7 receptor impacts on the expression profile of microRNAs in the brain, thereby possibly contributing to both the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and pathological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Analyzing and Decoding Natural Reach-and-Grasp Actions Using Gel, Water and Dry EEG Systems</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reaching and grasping is an essential part of everybody’s life, it allows meaningful interaction with the environment and is key to independent lifestyle. Recent electroencephalogram (EEG)-based studies have already shown that neural correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be identified in the EEG. However, it is still in question whether these results obtained in a laboratory environment can make the transition to mobile applicable EEG systems for home use. In the current study, we investigated whether EEG-based correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified and decoded using mobile EEG systems, namely the water-based EEG-Versatile&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; system and the dry-electrodes EEG-Hero&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; headset. In addition, we also analyzed gel-based recordings obtained in a laboratory environment (g.USBamp/g.Ladybird, gold standard), which followed the same experimental parameters. For each recording system, 15 study participants performed 80 self-initiated reach-and-grasp actions toward a glass (palmar grasp) and a spoon (lateral grasp). Our results confirmed that EEG-based correlates of reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified using these mobile systems. In a single-trial multiclass-based decoding approach, which incorporated both movement conditions and rest, we could show that the low frequency time domain (LFTD) correlates were also decodable. Grand average peak accuracy calculated on unseen test data yielded for the water-based electrode system 62.3% (9.2% STD), whereas for the dry-electrodes headset reached 56.4% (8% STD). For the gel-based electrode system 61.3% (8.6% STD) could be achieved. To foster and promote further investigations in the field of EEG-based movement decoding, as well as to allow the interested community to make their own conclusions, we provide all datasets publicly available in the BNCI Horizon 2020 database (http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Alterations in Resting-State Visual Networks in High-Tension Glaucoma: An Independent Component Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00330</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00330</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;High-tension glaucoma (HTG) is the most common type of primary open angle glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in resting-state visual networks in patients with HTG and investigate the effect of elevated IOP on the visual networks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images were acquired from 36 HTG patients (aged 49.22 ± 15.26 years) and 20 healthy controls (aged 49.90 ± 5.62 years). Group independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized to evaluate altered functional connectivity (FC) in resting-state visual networks between HTG patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis between mean IOP and altered FCs in the visual networks was performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ICA demonstrated decreased FCs in HTG group in the left calcarine cortex of the lateral visual network, in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the medial visual network and in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the occipital visual network compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed negative correlation between mean IOP and altered FC within the lateral visual network.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results suggested reduced FCs between primary and higher visual cortices in HTG brain. The IOP elevation might be responsible for the functional alterations in the visual networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: A Special Cranial Nucleus (CSF-Contacting Nucleus) in Primates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00053</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00053</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;There is a unique nucleus (CSF-contacting nucleus) in the brain of rat. It has been demonstrated in our previous research. The extraordinary feature of this nucleus is that it is not connected to any parenchymal organ but to the CSF. In primates, however, the presence or absence of this nucleus has not been proven. Confirmation of the presence of this nucleus in primates will provide the structural basis for brain-CSF communication and help to understand the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms in humans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The tracer cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CB-HRP) was injected into the CSF in the lateral ventricle (LV) of primate rhesus monkeys. After 48 h, the monkeys were perfused and the brain was dissected out, and sectioned for CB-HRP staining. The CB-HRP positive structures were observed under confocal and electron microscopy. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster was reconstructed by computer software.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;(1) CB-HRP labeling is confined within the ventricle, but not leakage into the brain parenchyma. (2) From the midbrain inferior colliculus superior border plane ventral to the aqueduct to the upper part of the fourth ventricle (4V) floor, a large number of CB-HRP positive neurons are consistently located, form a cluster, and are symmetrically located on both sides of the midline. (3) 3D reconstruction shows that the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster in the monkey brain occupies certain space. The rostral part is large and caudal part is thin appearing a “rivet”-like shape. (4) Under electron microscopy, the CB-HRP positive neurons show different types of synaptic connections with the non-CSF-contacting structures in the brain. Some of the processes stretch directly into the ventricle cavity.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Same as we did in rats, the CSF-contacting nucleus is also existed in the primate brain parenchyma. We also recommend listing it as the XIII pair of cranial nucleus, which is specialized in the communications between the brain and the CSF. It is significant to the completing of innervation in the organism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Disrupted Functional Network Connectivity Predicts Cognitive Impairment in Presbycusis Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00246</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Individuals with presbycusis often show deficits in cognitive function, however, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. This study explored the alterations in intra- and inter-network functional connectivity (FC) of multiple networks in presbycusis patients, and further correlated FC with cognitive assessment scores to assess their ability to predict cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed in 40 presbycusis patients and 40 matched controls, and 12 resting-state networks (RSNs) were identified by independent component analysis (ICA) approach. A two-sample t-test was carried out to detect the intra-network FC differences, and functional network connectivity (FNC) was calculated to compare the inter-network FC differences. Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis was subsequently used to explore the correlation between altered FC and cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated that patients with presbycusis showed significantly decreased FC in the subcortical limbic network (scLN), default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and attention network (AN) compared with the control group. Moreover, the connectivity for scLN-AUN (auditory network) and VN (visual network)-DMN were found significantly increased while AN-DMN was found significantly decreased in presbycusis patients. Ultimately, this study revealed the intra- and inter-network alterations associated with some cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study observed intra- and inter-network FC alterations in presbycusis patients, and investigated that presbycusis can lead to abnormal connectivity of RSNs and plasticity compensation mechanism, which may be the basis of cognitive impairment, suggesting that FNC can be used to predict potential cognitive impairment in their early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Aging Slopes of Brain Structures Vary by Ethnicity and Sex: Evidence From a Large Magnetic Resonance Imaging Dataset From a Single Scanner of Cognitively Healthy Elderly People in Korea</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00233</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aging of the brain is a well-investigated topic, but existing analyses have mainly focused on Caucasian samples. To investigate brain aging in East Asians, we measured cortical and subcortical volumes from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 1,008 cognitively normal elderly Koreans from the Gwangju Alzheimer’s and Related Dementia cohort and 342 Caucasians from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. To determine whether the aging effect varies with ethnicity and sex, beta coefficients of age and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in each ethnicity–sex group using a bootstrap method and a regression analysis using the relative volume to intracranial volume as predicted. The betas or aging slopes largely were not significantly different between ethnicity and sex groups in most types of brain structures. However, ethnic differences between the two female groups were found in the brain, most cortical regions, and a few subcortical regions. Ethnic differences in brain aging are likely due in large part to genetic factors; thus, we compared carriers and non-carriers of a gene relevant to longevity and neurodegenerative diseases, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4. The regions with ethnic differences in women also showed significant differences between Korean APOE ε4 non-carriers and Caucasian APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, Caucasian women showed significant APOE ε4 effects in the largest number of regions. These results illustrate that much of the ethnic differences in females may be explained by synergistic effects of ethnic background and APOE ε4 carrier status. Our results suggest that sex-dependent differences of aging between ethnic backgrounds may be due to ethnicity-dependent effects of genetic risk factors, such as APOE ε4. We also presented the normative information on volume estimates of the brain structures of the elderly Korean people in the subdivided age groups. This normative information of the aging brain stratified by ethnicity provides the age-related reference ranges quantified to replace visual judgment and facilitate precise clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gray Matter Alterations in Parkinson's Disease With Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder: A Meta-Analysis of Voxel-Based Morphometry Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00213</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00213</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Gray matter (GM) alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been demonstrated in many neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). However, the inconsistent findings between studies cannot be applied to clinical practice as a neuroimaging biomarker. We performed a meta-analysis of VBM studies at a whole-brain level to investigate GM differences between PD patients with and without RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to November 2019 to identify eligible VBM studies. We adopted the latest Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images technique to quantitatively estimate the difference of regional GM volume between PD patients with and without RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We included five studies comprising 105 PD patients with RBD and 140 PD patients without RBD. The pooled meta-analysis revealed that PD patients with RBD showed a significant reduction of GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared with those without RBD. This result was confirmed to be robust by the jackknife sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our finding shows significantly and robustly reduced GM volume in the right STG in PD patients with RBD, preliminarily suggesting the association of GM atrophy in this brain region with the occurrence of RBD in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Male-predominant galanin mediates androgen-dependent aggressive chases in medaka</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59470</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59470</link>
	<description>Recent studies in mice demonstrate that a subset of neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) that express galanin play crucial roles in regulating parental behavior in both sexes. However, little information is available on the function of galanin in social behaviors in other species. Here, we report that, in medaka, a subset of MPOA galanin neurons occurred nearly exclusively in males, resulting from testicular androgen stimulation. Galanin-deficient medaka showed a greatly reduced incidence of male–male aggressive chases. Furthermore, while treatment of female medaka with androgen induced male-typical aggressive acts, galanin deficiency in these females attenuated the effect of androgen on chases. Given their male-biased and androgen-dependent nature, the subset of MPOA galanin neurons most likely mediate androgen-dependent male–male chases. Histological studies further suggested that variability in the projection targets of the MPOA galanin neurons may account for the species-dependent functional differences in these evolutionarily conserved neural substrates.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alterations of specific cortical GABAergic circuits underlie abnormal network activity in a mouse model of Down syndrome</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58731</link>
	<description>Down syndrome (DS) results in various degrees of cognitive deficits. In DS mouse models, recovery of behavioral and neurophysiological deficits using GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonists led to hypothesize an excessive activity of inhibitory circuits in this condition. Nonetheless, whether over-inhibition is present in DS and whether this is due to specific alterations of distinct GABAergic circuits is unknown. In the prefrontal cortex of Ts65Dn mice (a well-established DS model), we found that the dendritic synaptic inhibitory loop formed by somatostatin-positive Martinotti cells (MCs) and pyramidal neurons (PNs) was strongly enhanced, with no alteration in their excitability. Conversely, perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons was unaltered, but PV cells of DS mice lost their classical fast-spiking phenotype and exhibited increased excitability. These microcircuit alterations resulted in reduced pyramidal-neuron firing and increased phase locking to cognitive-relevant network oscillations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results define important synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunctions in DS.</description>

	<description>The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) was published in 2013 and described how funding agencies, institutions, publishers, organizations that supply metrics, and individual researchers could better evaluate the outputs of scientific research. Since then DORA has evolved into an active initiative that gives practical advice to institutions on new ways to assess and evaluate research. This article outlines a framework for driving institutional change that was developed at a meeting convened by DORA and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The framework has four broad goals: understanding the obstacles to changes in the way research is assessed; experimenting with different approaches; creating a shared vision when revising existing policies and practices; and communicating that vision on campus and beyond.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Order matters: How covert value updating during sequential option sampling shapes economic preference</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Chen Hu, Philippe Domenech, Mathias Pessiglione&lt;/p&gt;

Standard neuroeconomic decision theory assumes that choice is based on a value comparison process, independent from how information about alternative options is collected. Here, we investigate the opposite intuition that preferences are dynamically shaped as options are sampled, through iterative covert pairwise comparisons. Our model builds on two lines of research, one suggesting that a natural frame of comparison for the brain is between default and alternative options, the other suggesting that comparisons spread preferences between options. We therefore assumed that during sequential option sampling, people would 1) covertly compare every new alternative to the current best and 2) update their values such that the winning (losing) option receives a positive (negative) bonus. We confronted this “covert pairwise comparison” model to models derived from standard decision theory and from known memory effects. Our model provided the best account of human choice behavior in a novel task where participants (n = 92 in total) had to browse through a sequence of items (food, music or movie) of variable length and ultimately select their favorite option. Consistently, the order of option presentation, which was manipulated by design, had a significant influence on the eventual choice: the best option was more likely to be chosen when it came earlier in the sequence, because it won more covert comparisons (hence a greater total bonus). Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how the option sampling process shapes economic preference, which should be integrated into decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vlknqot9jVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rapid evolution of the primate larynx?</title>

Tissue vibrations in the larynx produce most sounds that comprise vocal communication in mammals. Larynx morphology is thus predicted to be a key target for selection, particularly in species with highly developed vocal communication systems. Here, we present a novel database of digitally modeled scanned larynges from 55 different mammalian species, representing a wide range of body sizes in the primate and carnivoran orders. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate that the primate larynx has evolved more rapidly than the carnivoran larynx, resulting in a pattern of larger size and increased deviation from expected allometry with body size. These results imply fundamental differences between primates and carnivorans in the balance of selective forces that constrain larynx size and highlight an evolutionary flexibility in primates that may help explain why we have developed complex and diverse uses of the vocal organ for communication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MrGQspFPUS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: State-Dependent and Bandwidth-Specific Effects of Ketamine and Propofol on Electroencephalographic Complexity in Rats</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00050</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate as to whether ketamine anesthesia suppresses neurophysiologic complexity at doses sufficient for surgical anesthesia, with previous human studies reporting surrogates of both suppressed and preserved levels of cortical complexity. However, these studies have not assessed cortical dynamics in higher gamma frequencies, which have previously been demonstrated to correlate with the level of consciousness during anesthesia. In this study, we used Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc) to characterize frontal and parietal electroencephalographic complexity (0.5–175 Hz, 0.5–55 Hz, 65–175 Hz) before, during, and after ketamine or propofol anesthesia in the rat. To control for the potential influence of spectral changes in complexity estimation, LZc was normalized with phase-shuffled surrogate data. We demonstrate that ketamine and propofol anesthesia were characterized by a significant reduction in broadband (0.5–175 Hz) LZc. Further analysis showed that while the reduction of LZc during ketamine anesthesia was significant in 65–175 Hz range, during propofol anesthesia, a significant decrease was observed in 0.5–55 Hz bandwidth. LZc in broadband and 0.5–55 Hz range showed a significant increase during emergence from ketamine anesthesia. Phase-shuffled normalized LZc revealed that (1) decrease in complexity during ketamine and propofol anesthesia—not increase in complexity during emergence—were dissociable from the influence of spectral changes, and (2) reduced LZc during ketamine anesthesia was present across all three bandwidths. Ketamine anesthesia was characterized by reduced complexity in high gamma bandwidth, as reflected in both raw and phase-shuffled normalized LZc, which suggests that reduced high gamma complexity is a neurophysiological feature of ketamine anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in social-communication impairments, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, ASD is more prevalent in males, with a male to female ratio of 4 to 1. Although the underlying etiology of ASD is generally unknown, recent advances in genome sequencing have facilitated the identification of a host of associated genes. Among these, synaptic proteins such as cell adhesion molecules have been strongly linked with ASD. Interestingly, many large genome sequencing studies exclude sex chromosomes, which leads to a shift in focus toward autosomal genes as targets for ASD research. However, there are many genes on the X chromosome that encode synaptic proteins, including strong candidate genes. Here, we review findings regarding two members of the neuroligin (NLGN) family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules, NLGN3 and NLGN4. Neuroligins have multiple isoforms (NLGN1-4), which are both autosomal and sex-linked. The sex-linked genes, NLGN3 and NLGN4, are both on the X chromosome and were among the first few genes to be linked with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). In addition, there is a less studied human neuroligin on the Y chromosome, NLGN4Y, which forms an X-Y pair with NLGN4X. We will discuss recent findings of these neuroligin isoforms regarding function at the synapse in both rodent models and human-derived differentiated neurons, and highlight the exciting challenges moving forward to a better understanding of ASD/ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presynaptic compartment of the chemical synapse is a small, yet extremely complex structure. Considering its size, most methods of optical microscopy are not able to resolve its nanoarchitecture and dynamics. Thus, its ultrastructure could only be studied by electron microscopy. In the last decade, new methods of optical superresolution microscopy have emerged allowing the study of cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. While this is a welcome addition to the experimental arsenal, it has necessitated careful analysis and interpretation to ensure the data obtained remains artifact-free. In this article we review the application of nanoscopic techniques to the study of the synapse and the progress made over the last decade with a particular focus on the presynapse. We find to our surprise that progress has been limited, calling for imaging techniques and probes that allow dense labeling, multiplexing, longer imaging times, higher temporal resolution, while at least maintaining the spatial resolution achieved thus far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A GWAS study recently demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human GLRB gene of individuals with a prevalence for agoraphobia. GLRB encodes the glycine receptor (GlyRs) β subunit. The identified SNPs are localized within the gene flanking regions (3′ and 5′ UTRs) and intronic regions. It was suggested that these nucleotide polymorphisms modify GlyRs expression and phenotypic behavior in humans contributing to an anxiety phenotype as a mild form of hyperekplexia. Hyperekplexia is a human neuromotor disorder with massive startle phenotypes due to mutations in genes encoding GlyRs subunits. GLRA1 mutations have been more commonly observed than GLRB mutations. If an anxiety phenotype contributes to the hyperekplexia disease pattern has not been investigated yet. Here, we compared two mouse models harboring either a mutation in the murine Glra1 or Glrb gene with regard to anxiety and startle phenotypes. Homozygous spasmodic animals carrying a Glra1 point mutation (alanine 52 to serine) displayed abnormally enhanced startle responses. Moreover, spasmodic mice exhibited significant changes in fear-related behaviors (freezing, rearing and time spent on back) analyzed during the startle paradigm, even in a neutral context. Spastic mice exhibit reduced expression levels of the full-length GlyRs β subunit due to aberrant splicing of the Glrb gene. Heterozygous animals appear normal without an obvious behavioral phenotype and thus might reflect the human situation analyzed in the GWAS study on agoraphobia and startle. In contrast to spasmodic mice, heterozygous spastic animals revealed no startle phenotype in a neutral as well as a conditioning context. Other mechanisms such as a modulatory function of the GlyRs β subunit within glycinergic circuits in neuronal networks important for fear and fear-related behavior may exist. Possibly, in human additional changes in fear and fear-related circuits either due to gene-gene interactions e.g., with GLRA1 genes or epigenetic factors are necessary to create the agoraphobia and in particular the startle phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Vestibular Modulation of Long-Term Potentiation and NMDA Receptor Expression in the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loss of vestibular function is known to cause spatial memory deficits and hippocampal dysfunction, in terms of impaired place cell firing and abnormal theta rhythm. Based on these results, it has been of interest to determine whether vestibular loss also affects the development and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This article summarizes and critically reviews the studies of hippocampal LTP following a vestibular loss and its relationship to NMDA receptor expression, that have been published to date. Although the available in vitro studies indicate that unilateral vestibular loss (UVL) results in reduced hippocampal field potentials in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG), the in vivo studies involving bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) do not. This may be due to the differences between UVL and BVL or it could be a result of in vitro/in vivo differences. One in vitro study reported a decrease in LTP in hippocampal slices following UVL; however, the two available in vivo studies have reported different results: either no effect or an increase in EPSP/Population Spike (ES) potentiation. This discrepancy may be due to the different high-frequency stimulation (HFS) paradigms used to induce LTP. The increased ES potentiation following BVL may be related to an increase in synaptic NMDA receptors, possibly increasing the flow of vestibular input coming into CA1, with a loss of selectivity. This might cause increased excitability and synaptic noise, which might lead to a degradation of spatial learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The precise physiopathological association between the courses of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. This study sought to comprehensively investigate the distribution characteristics of gray matter atrophy in middle-aged T2DM patients with newly diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Four groups, including 28 patients with early-onset MCI, 28 patients with T2DM, 28 T2DM patients with early-onset MCI (T2DM-MCI), and 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent three-dimensional high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes were calculated, and a structural covariance method was used to evaluate the morphological relationships within the default mode network (DMN).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overlapped and unique cortical/subcortical gray matter atrophy was found in patients with MCI, T2DM and T2DM-MCI in our study, and patients with T2DM-MCI showed lower volumes in several areas than patients with MCI or T2DM. Volume loss in subcortical areas (including the thalamus, putamen, and hippocampus), but not in cortical areas, was related to cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. No associations between biochemical measurements and volumetric reductions were found. Furthermore, patients with MCI and those with T2DM-MCI showed disrupted structural connectivity within the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings provide further evidence that T2DM may exacerbate atrophy of specific gray matter regions, which may be primarily associated with MCI. Impairments in gray matter volume related to T2DM or MCI are independent of cardiovascular risk factors, and subcortical atrophy may play a more pivotal role in cognitive impairment than cortical alterations in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. The enhanced structural connectivity within the DMN in patients with T2DM-MCI may suggest a compensatory mechanism for the chronic neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Fingolimod Inhibits Inflammation but Exacerbates Brain Edema in the Acute Phases of Cerebral Ischemia in Diabetic Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00842</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Diabetes mellitus increases stroke incidence and mortality and hampers functional recovery after stroke. Fingolimod has been shown to improve neurofunctional recovery and reduce brain infarction after ischemic injury in mice without comorbidities. In this work, we investigated the effects of fingolimod in diabetic mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Hyperglycemia was induced by a single bolus streptozotocin injection. Adult male ICR mice (n = 86) underwent 1-h tMCAO surgery and received intraperitoneal injection of fingolimod (1 mg/kg) or vehicle immediately after reperfusion. Clark neurological score, brain infarction and edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, apoptosis, and inflammation were evaluated at 24 h after tMCAO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fingolimod treatment reduced the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells and lowered the mRNA level of Tnfα. It also increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. However, fingolimod significantly aggravated brain edema and reduced the expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin. The negative impacts of fingolimod on BBB integrity outweighed its beneficial effects in anti-inflammation, which resulted in the lack of improvement in endpoint outcomes at 24 h after tMCAO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Caution should be taken in considering the acute treatment using fingolimod for ischemic stroke with diabetes comorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Understanding the Real State of Human Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis From Studies of Rodents and Non-human Primates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has been widely accepted, and a large number of studies have been performed in rodents using modern experimental techniques, which have clarified the nature and developmental processes of adult neural stem/progenitor cells, the functions of AHN, such as memory and learning, and its association with neural diseases. However, a fundamental problem is that it remains unclear as to what extent AHN actually occurs in humans. The answer to this is indispensable when physiological and pathological functions of human AHN are deduced from studies of rodent AHN, but there are controversial data on the extent of human AHN. In this review, studies on AHN performed in rodents and humans will be briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of the studies in non-human primates. Then, how data of rodent and non-human primate AHN should be applied for understanding human AHN will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: CHIME: CMOS-Hosted in vivo Microelectrodes for Massively Scalable Neuronal Recordings</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00834</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mammalian brains consist of 10s of millions to 100s of billions of neurons operating at millisecond time scales, of which current recording techniques only capture a tiny fraction. Recording techniques capable of sampling neural activity at high spatiotemporal resolution have been difficult to scale. The most intensively studied mammalian neuronal networks, such as the neocortex, show a layered architecture, where the optimal recording technology samples densely over large areas. However, the need for application-specific designs as well as the mismatch between the three-dimensional architecture of the brain and largely two-dimensional microfabrication techniques profoundly limits both neurophysiological research and neural prosthetics. Here, we discuss a novel strategy for scalable neuronal recording by combining bundles of glass-ensheathed microwires with large-scale amplifier arrays derived from high-density CMOS in vitro MEA systems or high-speed infrared cameras. High signal-to-noise ratio (&amp;lt;25 μV RMS noise floor, SNR up to 25) is achieved due to the high conductivity of core metals in glass-ensheathed microwires allowing for ultrathin metal cores (down to &amp;lt;1 μm) and negligible stray capacitance. Multi-step electrochemical modification of the tip enables ultra-low access impedance with minimal geometric area, which is largely independent of the core diameter. We show that the microwire size can be reduced to virtually eliminate damage to the blood-brain-barrier upon insertion and we demonstrate that microwire arrays can stably record single-unit activity. Combining microwire bundles and CMOS arrays allows for a highly scalable neuronal recording approach, linking the progress in electrical neuronal recordings to the rapid progress in silicon microfabrication. The modular design of the system allows for custom arrangement of recording sites. Our approach of employing bundles of minimally invasive, highly insulated and functionalized microwires to extend a two-dimensional CMOS architecture into the 3rd dimension can be translated to other CMOS arrays, such as electrical stimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: A Panel of Synapse-Related Genes as a Biomarker for Gliomas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00822</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma patients, and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo synapses with neurons, and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 17 synapse-related genes and then proposed a metric, synapse score to quantify the “stemness” for each sample of 12 glioma gene expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, synapse score showed excellent predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, synapse score demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this study proposed a quantitative method, synapse score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deciphering Brain Function by Miniaturized Fluorescence Microscopy in Freely Behaving Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00819</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is regulated by environmental stimuli and is shaped by the activity of neural networks, underscoring the importance of assessing the morpho-functional properties of different populations of cells in freely behaving animals. In recent years, a number of optical tools have been developed to monitor and modulate neuronal and glial activity at the protein, cellular, or network level and have opened up new avenues for studying brain function in freely behaving animals. Tools such as genetically encoded sensors and actuators are now commonly used for studying brain activity and function through their expression in different neuronal ensembles. In parallel, microscopy has also made major progress over the last decades. The advent of miniature microscopes (mini-microscopes also called mini-endoscopes) has become a method of choice for studying brain activity at the cellular and network levels in different brain regions of freely behaving mice. This technique also allows for longitudinal investigations while animals carrying the microscope on their head are performing behavioral tasks. In this review, we will discuss mini-endoscopic imaging and the advantages that these devices offer to research. We will also discuss current limitations of and potential future improvements in mini-endoscopic imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Tracing Pilots’ Situation Assessment by Neuroadaptive Cognitive Modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00795</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00795</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study presents the integration of a passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) and cognitive modeling as a method to trace pilots’ perception and processing of auditory alerts and messages during operations. Missing alerts on the flight deck can result in out-of-the-loop problems that can lead to accidents. By tracing pilots’ perception and responses to alerts, cognitive assistance can be provided based on individual needs to ensure they maintain adequate situation awareness. Data from 24 participating aircrew in a simulated flight study that included multiple alerts and air traffic control messages in single pilot setup are presented. A classifier was trained to identify pilots’ neurophysiological reactions to alerts and messages from participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG). A neuroadaptive ACT-R model using EEG data was compared to a conventional normative model regarding accuracy in representing individual pilots. Results show that passive BCI can distinguish between alerts that are processed by the pilot as task-relevant or irrelevant in the cockpit based on the recorded EEG. The neuroadaptive model’s integration of this data resulted in significantly higher performance of 87% overall accuracy in representing individual pilots’ responses to alerts and messages compared to 72% accuracy of a normative model that did not consider EEG data. We conclude that neuroadaptive technology allows for implicit measurement and tracing of pilots’ perception and processing of alerts on the flight deck. Careful handling of uncertainties inherent to passive BCI and cognitive modeling shows how the representation of pilot cognitive states can be improved iteratively for providing assistance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Electroencephalographic Cross-Frequency Coupling as a Sign of Disease Progression in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00790</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to mild objective cognitive deficits and is associated with the later development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, not all patients with MCI convert to AD. EEG spectral power has shown promise as a marker of progression, but brain oscillations in different frequencies are not isolated entities. Coupling between different frequency bands, so-called cross-frequency coupling (CFC), has been associated with memory function and may further contribute to our understanding of what characterizes patients with MCI who progress to AD. In the current study, we wanted to investigate the changes in gamma/theta CFC in patients with AD and MCI compared to HC and in patients with pMCI compared to patients with sMCI. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the association with cognitive test scores. EEGs were included at baseline for 15 patients with AD, 25 patients with MCI, and 36 older HC, and the participants were followed for up to 3 years. To investigate CFC, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which has been shown to be less affected by noisy data compared to other techniques. We found that patients with pMCI showed a significantly lower global gamma/theta CFC compared to patients with sMCI. In addition, global gamma/theta CFC was significantly correlated with Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) score (p-value = 0.030, rho = 0.527). Although not significant, patients with AD and MCI showed a lower gamma/theta CFC compared to HC. These findings suggest that gamma/theta CFC is important for proper cognitive functioning and that a decrease in gamma/theta CFC in patients with MCI may be a sign of progression. Gamma/theta CFC may therefore serve as a progression marker in MCI, but larger studies are needed to validate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Chromatic Pupillometry Findings in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are crucial for non-image forming functions of the eye, including the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Chromatic pupillometry, using light stimuli at different wavelengths, makes possible the isolation of the contribution of rods, cones, and mRGCs to the PLR. In particular, post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) is the most reliable pupil metric of mRGC function. We have previously described, in post-mortem investigations of AD retinas, a loss of mRGCs, and in the remaining mRGCs, we demonstrated extensive morphological abnormalities. We noted dendrite varicosities, patchy distribution of melanopsin, and reduced dendrite arborization. In this study, we evaluated, with chromatic pupillometry, the PLR in a cohort of mild-moderate AD patients compared to controls. AD and controls also underwent an extensive ophthalmological evaluation. In our AD cohort, PIPR did not significantly differ from controls, even though we observed a higher variability in the AD group and 5/26 showed PIPR values outside the 2 SD from the control mean values. Moreover, we found a significant difference between AD and controls in terms of rod-mediated transient PLR amplitude. These results suggest that in the early stage of AD there are PLR abnormalities that may reflect a pathology affecting mRGC dendrites before involving the mRGC cell body. Further studies, including AD cases with more severe and longer disease duration, are needed to further explore this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Toward Long-Term Communication With the Brain in the Blind by Intracortical Stimulation: Challenges and Future Prospects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The restoration of a useful visual sense in a profoundly blind person by direct electrical stimulation of the visual cortex has been a subject of study for many years. However, the field of cortically based sight restoration has made few advances in the last few decades, and many problems remain. In this context, the scientific and technological problems associated with safe and effective communication with the brain are very complex, and there are still many unresolved issues delaying its development. In this work, we review some of the biological and technical issues that still remain to be solved, including long-term biotolerability, the number of electrodes required to provide useful vision, and the delivery of information to the implants. Furthermore, we emphasize the possible role of the neuroplastic changes that follow vision loss in the success of this approach. We propose that increased collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers, and neural engineers will enhance our ability to send meaningful information to the brain and restore a limited but useful sense of vision to many blind individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Healthy Diet on Cognitive Performance Among Healthy Seniors – A Mini Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00325</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00325</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At present, a healthy diet appears to be one of the suitable strategies in slowing down cognitive decline in the process of aging. A number of evidence-based studies confirm its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this mini review is to evaluate and describe recent randomized clinical and cohort studies exploring the effect of healthy diet on cognitive performance among healthy seniors, as well as to update the existing information on this research issue. For these reasons, the authors reviewed full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles written in English and available in Web of Science and PubMed between September 2017 and February 2020. Altogether nine original studies were detected. The results indicate that healthy diet and healthy diet components generally have a positive impact on the enhancement of cognitive functions. Furthermore, the findings reveal that dietary patterns, as well as single nutrients might have a significant effect on specific cognitive domains, such as memory in general, episodic memory, or processing speed. It also seems that a strict adherence to the dietary patterns and a higher diet variety have a more significant effect on the improvement of cognitive functions. Nevertheless, there seem to be gender differences in dietary behavior. More recently, personalized dietary interventions started to be used in delaying cognitive decline among healthy seniors. Therefore, more randomized control trials or N-of-1 trials should be performed in this research area in order to detect the most suitable dietary pattern or nutrients, which would, together with other modifiable lifestyle factors, contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of Gesture in Communication and Cognition: Implications for Understanding and Treating Neurogenic Communication Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When people talk, they gesture. Gesture is a fundamental component of language that contributes meaningful and unique information to a spoken message and reflects the speaker’s underlying knowledge and experiences. Theoretical perspectives of speech and gesture propose that they share a common conceptual origin and have a tightly integrated relationship, overlapping in time, meaning, and function to enrich the communicative context. We review a robust literature from the field of psychology documenting the benefits of gesture for communication for both speakers and listeners, as well as its important cognitive functions for organizing spoken language, and facilitating problem-solving, learning, and memory. Despite this evidence, gesture has been relatively understudied in populations with neurogenic communication disorders. While few studies have examined the rehabilitative potential of gesture in these populations, others have ignored gesture entirely or even discouraged its use. We review the literature characterizing gesture production and its role in intervention for people with aphasia, as well as describe the much sparser literature on gesture in cognitive communication disorders including right hemisphere damage, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. The neuroanatomical and behavioral profiles of these patient populations provide a unique opportunity to test theories of the relationship of speech and gesture and advance our understanding of their neural correlates. This review highlights several gaps in the field of communication disorders which may serve as a bridge for applying the psychological literature of gesture to the study of language disorders. Such future work would benefit from considering theoretical perspectives of gesture and using more rigorous and quantitative empirical methods in its approaches. We discuss implications for leveraging gesture to explore its untapped potential in understanding and rehabilitating neurogenic communication disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Is the Immunological Response a Bottleneck for Cell Therapy in Neurodegenerative Diseases?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are characterized by a selective detrimental impact on neurons in a specific brain area. Currently, these diseases have no cures, although some promising trials of therapies that may be able to slow the loss of brain cells are underway. Cell therapy is distinguished by its potential to replace cells to compensate for those lost to the degenerative process and has shown a great potential to replace degenerated neurons in animal models and in clinical trials in PD and HD patients. Fetal-derived neural progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells are the main cell sources that have been tested in cell therapy approaches. Furthermore, new strategies are emerging, such as the use of adult stem cells, encapsulated cell lines releasing trophic factors or cell-free products, containing an enriched secretome, which have shown beneficial preclinical outcomes. One of the major challenges for these potential new treatments is to overcome the host immune response to the transplanted cells. Immune rejection can cause significant alterations in transplanted and endogenous tissue and requires immunosuppressive drugs that may produce adverse effects. T-, B-lymphocytes and microglia have been recognized as the main effectors in striatal graft rejection. This review aims to summarize the preclinical and clinical studies of cell therapies in PD and HD. In addition, the precautions and strategies to ensure the highest quality of cell grafts, the lowest risk during transplantation and the reduction of a possible immune rejection will be outlined. Altogether, the wide-ranging possibilities of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) could make therapeutic treatment of these incurable diseases possible in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Sensory Neuron Development in CMT2D Mice Is Site-Specific and Linked to Increased GlyRS Levels</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dominant, missense mutations in the widely and constitutively expressed GARS1 gene cause peripheral neuropathy that usually begins in adolescence and principally impacts the upper limbs. Caused by a toxic gain-of-function in the encoded glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) enzyme, the neuropathology appears to be independent of the canonical role of GlyRS in aminoacylation. Patients display progressive, life-long weakness and wasting of muscles in hands followed by feet, with frequently associated deficits in sensation. When dysfunction is observed in motor and sensory nerves, there is a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D), or distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V if the symptoms are purely motor. The cause of this varied sensory involvement remains unresolved, as are the pathomechanisms underlying the selective neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. We have previously identified in CMT2D mice that neuropathy-causing Gars mutations perturb sensory neuron fate and permit mutant GlyRS to aberrantly interact with neurotrophin receptors (Trks). Here, we extend this work by interrogating further the anatomy and function of the CMT2D sensory nervous system in mutant Gars mice, obtaining several key results: (1) sensory pathology is restricted to neurons innervating the hindlimbs; (2) perturbation of sensory development is not common to all mouse models of neuromuscular disease; (3) in vitro axonal transport of signaling endosomes is not impaired in afferent neurons of all CMT2D mouse models; and (4) Gars expression is selectively elevated in a subset of sensory neurons and linked to sensory developmental defects. These findings highlight the importance of comparative neurological assessment in mouse models of disease and shed light on key proposed neuropathogenic mechanisms in GARS1-linked neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment is the main gold-standard therapy for Parkinson disease (PD). Besides good antiparkinsonian effects, prolonged use of this drug is associated to the development of involuntary movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is linked to a sensitization of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors located on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the dorsal striatum. Several evidences have shown that the emergence of LID can be related to striatal D1/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway overactivation associated to aberrant N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. In addition, within striatum, ERK1/2 is also able to modulate in a D1 receptor-dependent manner the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway under DA depletion and L-DOPA therapy. Consistently, increased mTORC1 signaling appears during chronic administration of L-DOPA and shows a high correlation with the severity of dyskinesia. Furthermore, the abnormal activation of the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 cascade is paralleled by increased phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor at the PKA Ser845 site. The GluA1 promotes excitatory AMPA receptor-mediated transmission and may be implicated in the alterations found at the corticostriatal synapses of dyskinetic animals. In our study, we investigated the role of mTORC1 pathway activation in modulating bidirectional striatal synaptic plasticity in L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian rats. Inhibition of mTORC1 by coadministration of rapamycin to L-DOPA was able to limit the magnitude of LID expression, accounting for a therapeutic effect of this drug. In particular, behavioral data showed that, in L-DOPA-treated rats, rapamycin administration induced a selective decrease of distinct components of abnormal involuntary movements (i.e., axial and orolingual dyskinesia). Furthermore, ex vivo patch clamp and intracellular recordings of SPNs revealed that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 also resulted associated with a physiological bidirectional plasticity, when compared to dyskinetic rats treated with L-DOPA alone. This study uncovers the important role of mTORC1 inhibition to prevent the loss of striatal bidirectional plasticity under chronic L-DOPA treatment in rodent models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Deletion of Stk11 and Fos in mouse BLA projection neurons alters intrinsic excitability and impairs formation of long-term aversive memory</title>

	<description>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is a form of one-trial learning dependent on basolateral amygdala projection neurons (BLApn). Its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. RNAseq from BLApn identified changes in multiple candidate learning-related transcripts including the expected immediate early gene &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stk11&lt;/i&gt;, a master kinase of the AMP-related kinase pathway with important roles in growth, metabolism and development, but not previously implicated in learning. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Stk11&lt;/i&gt; in BLApn blocked memory prior to training, but not following it and increased neuronal excitability. Conversely, BLApn had reduced excitability following CTA. BLApn knockout of a second learning-related gene, &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt;, also increased excitability and impaired learning. Independently increasing BLApn excitability chemogenetically during CTA also impaired memory. STK11 and C-FOS activation were independent of one another. These data suggest key roles for &lt;i&gt;Stk11&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; in CTA long-term memory formation, dependent at least partly through convergent action on BLApn intrinsic excitability.</description>

	<title>eLife: Irisin directly stimulates osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro and in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58172</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58172</link>
	<description>The myokine irisin facilitates muscle-bone crosstalk and skeletal remodeling in part by its action on osteoblasts and osteocytes. In the current study we investigated whether irisin also directly regulates osteoclasts. &lt;i&gt;In vitro,&lt;/i&gt; irisin (2-10 ng/mL) increased osteoclast differentiation in C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow progenitors; this increase was blocked by a neutralizing antibody to integrin α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Irisin also increased bone resorption on several substrates &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. RNAseq revealed differential gene expression induced by irisin including upregulation of markers for osteoclast differentiation and resorption, as well as osteoblast-stimulating 'clastokines'. Forced expression of the irisin precursor &lt;i&gt;Fndc5&lt;/i&gt; in transgenic C57BL/6J mice resulted in low bone mass at three ages, and greater &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; osteoclastogenesis from &lt;i&gt;Fndc5&lt;/i&gt;-transgenic bone marrow progenitors. This work demonstrates that irisin acts directly on osteoclast progenitors to increase differentiation and promote bone resorption, supporting the tenet that irisin not only stimulates bone remodeling but may also be an important counter-regulatory hormone.</description>

	<title>eLife: MARCH8 inhibits viral infection by two different mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57763</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57763</link>
	<description>Membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) inhibits infection with both HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses by reducing virion incorporation of envelope glycoproteins. The molecular mechanisms by which MARCH8 targets envelope glycoproteins remain unknown. Here, we show two different mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infection. Viruses pseudotyped with the VSV-G mutant, in which cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated, were insensitive to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8, whereas those with a similar lysine mutant of HIV-1 Env remained sensitive to it. Indeed, the wild-type VSV-G, but not its lysine mutant, was ubiquitinated by MARCH8. Furthermore, the MARCH8 mutant, which had a disrupted cytoplasmic tyrosine motif that is critical for intracellular protein sorting, did not inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, while it still impaired infection by VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses. Overall, we conclude that MARCH8 reduces viral infectivity by downregulating envelope glycoproteins through two different mechanisms mediated by a ubiquitination-dependent or tyrosine motif-dependent pathway.</description>

	<title>eLife: A Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein paralog defines a novel class of heme-binding proteins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57081</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57081</link>
	<description>Yeast Sfh5 is an unusual member of the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. Whereas PITPs are defined by their abilities to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membranes in vitro, and to stimulate phosphoinositide signaling in vivo, Sfh5 does not exhibit these activities. Rather, Sfh5 is a redox-active penta-coordinate high spin Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; hemoprotein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves a co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure connecting the open shell iron &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals with three aromatic ring systems. That Sfh5 is not a PITP is supported by demonstrations that heme is not a readily exchangeable ligand, and that phosphatidylinositol-exchange activity is resuscitated in heme binding-deficient Sfh5 mutants. The collective data identify Sfh5 as the prototype of a new class of fungal hemoproteins, and emphasize the versatility of the Sec14-fold as scaffold for translating the binding of chemically distinct ligands to the control of diverse sets of cellular activities.</description>

	<title>eLife: A theory of joint attractor dynamics in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex accounts for artificial remapping and grid cell field-to-field variability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56894</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56894</link>
	<description>The representation of position in the mammalian brain is distributed across multiple neural populations. Grid cell modules in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) express activity patterns that span a low-dimensional manifold which remains stable across different environments. In contrast, the activity patterns of hippocampal place cells span distinct low-dimensional manifolds in different environments. It is unknown how these multiple representations of position are coordinated. Here we develop a theory of joint attractor dynamics in the hippocampus and the MEC. We show that the system exhibits a coordinated, joint representation of position across multiple environments, consistent with global remapping in place cells and grid cells. In addition, our model accounts for recent experimental observations that lack a mechanistic explanation: variability in the firing rate of single grid cells across firing fields, and artificial remapping of place cells under depolarization, but not under hyperpolarization, of layer II stellate cells of the MEC.</description>

	<title>eLife: Caterpillar-induced rice volatiles provide enemy-free space for the offspring of the brown planthopper</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55421</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55421</link>
	<description>Plants typically release large quantities of volatiles in response to herbivory by insects. This benefits the plants by, for instance, attracting the natural enemies of the herbivores. We show that the brown planthopper (BPH) has cleverly turned this around by exploiting herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that provide safe havens for its offspring. BPH females preferentially oviposit on rice plants already infested by the rice striped stem borer (SSB), which are avoided by the egg parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Anagrus nilaparvatae&lt;/i&gt;, the most important natural enemy of BPH. Using synthetic versions of volatiles identified from plants infested by BPH and/or SSB, we demonstrate the role of HIPVs in these interactions. Moreover, greenhouse and field cage experiments confirm the adaptiveness of the BPH oviposition strategy, resulting in 80% lower parasitism rates of its eggs. Besides revealing a novel exploitation of HIPVs, these findings may lead to novel control strategies against an exceedingly important rice pest.</description>

	<description>A variety of microscopy techniques are used by researchers in the life and biomedical sciences. As these techniques become more powerful and more complex, it is vital that scientific articles containing images obtained with advanced microscopes include full details about how each image was obtained. To explore the reporting of such details we examined 240 original research articles published in eight journals. We found that the quality of reporting was poor, with some articles containing no information about how images were obtained, and many articles lacking important basic details. Efforts by researchers, funding agencies, journals, equipment manufacturers and staff at shared imaging facilities are required to improve the reporting of experiments that rely on microscopy techniques.</description>

	<description>Guitchounts et al. find that the primary visual cortex (V1) of freely moving rats encodes 3D orienting movements of the head (HOMs). V1 is suppressed or enhanced by HOMs, depending on lighting condition, and individual neurons encode HOM direction. This encoding depends on secondary motor cortex (M2).</description>

Bouvier et al. show that ambient light affects how primary visual cortex (V1) responds to head movements. V1 is suppressed by head movements in darkness and excited by head movements in light through the differential recruitment of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.</description>

	<description>Cells carry STAG1- and STAG2-cohesin complexes whose functional specificity remains unclear. De Koninck et al. show that Stag2 deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality by mid-gestation. In contrast, STAG2 is not strictly required for viability in cells or adult tissues, and its loss is not sufficient to elicit tumorigenesis.</description>

	<description>Zhao et al. identify OGT in intestinal epithelial cells as a “molecular brake” on L cell development and function in response to nutritional and microbial cues. OGT inhibits Ngn3 gene transcription and enteroendocrine differentiation via FOXO1 O-GlcNAcylation. Microbiota-derived SCFAs drive epithelial O-GlcNAcylation, which further influences gut microbiota to control systemic metabolism.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; co-factor balance estimation using constraint-based modelling informs metabolic engineering in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura de Arroyo Garcia, Patrik R. Jones&lt;/p&gt;

In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as “factories” that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells’ native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termed &lt;i&gt;co-factor balance&lt;/i&gt;, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on the final product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074–1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cksuVli6J44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Facilitating the propagation of spiking activity in feedforward networks by including feedback</title>

Transient oscillations in network activity upon sensory stimulation have been reported in different sensory areas of the brain. These evoked oscillations are the generic response of networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (&lt;i&gt;EI&lt;/i&gt;-networks) to a transient external input. Recently, it has been shown that this resonance property of &lt;i&gt;EI&lt;/i&gt;-networks can be exploited for communication in modular neuronal networks by enabling the transmission of sequences of synchronous spike volleys (’pulse packets’), despite the sparse and weak connectivity between the modules. The condition for successful transmission is that the pulse packet (PP) intervals match the period of the modules’ resonance frequency. Hence, the mechanism was termed &lt;i&gt;communication through resonance (CTR)&lt;/i&gt;. This mechanism has three severe constraints, though. First, it needs periodic trains of PPs, whereas single PPs fail to propagate. Second, the inter-PP interval needs to match the network resonance. Third, transmission is very slow, because in each module, the network resonance needs to build up over multiple oscillation cycles. Here, we show that, by adding appropriate feedback connections to the network, the CTR mechanism can be improved and the aforementioned constraints relaxed. Specifically, we show that adding feedback connections between two upstream modules, called the resonance pair, in an otherwise feedforward modular network can support successful propagation of a single PP throughout the entire network. The key condition for successful transmission is that the sum of the forward and backward delays in the resonance pair matches the resonance frequency of the network modules. The transmission is much faster, by more than a factor of two, than in the original CTR mechanism. Moreover, it distinctly lowers the threshold for successful communication by synchronous spiking in modular networks of weakly coupled networks. Thus, our results suggest a new functional role of bidirectional connectivity for the communication in cortical area networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIpLJn8J4Lc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Reliable estimation of membrane curvature for cryo-electron tomography</title>

Curvature is a fundamental morphological descriptor of cellular membranes. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is particularly well-suited to visualize and analyze membrane morphology in a close-to-native state and molecular resolution. However, current curvature estimation methods cannot be applied directly to membrane segmentations in cryo-ET, as these methods cannot cope with some of the artifacts introduced during image acquisition and membrane segmentation, such as quantization noise and open borders. Here, we developed and implemented a Python package for membrane curvature estimation from tomogram segmentations, which we named PyCurv. From a membrane segmentation, a signed surface (triangle mesh) is first extracted. The triangle mesh is then represented by a graph, which facilitates finding neighboring triangles and the calculation of geodesic distances necessary for local curvature estimation. PyCurv estimates curvature based on tensor voting. Beside curvatures, this algorithm also provides robust estimations of surface normals and principal directions. We tested PyCurv and three well-established methods on benchmark surfaces and biological data. This revealed the superior performance of PyCurv not only for cryo-ET, but also for data generated by other techniques such as light microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Altogether, PyCurv is a versatile open-source software to reliably estimate curvature of membranes and other surfaces in a wide variety of applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MMlj9Wbreok&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) regulates synaptic plasticity in multiple ways, supposedly including the secretion of neuromodulators like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that neuromodulator secretion is indeed reduced in mouse α- and βCaMKII-deficient (αβCaMKII double-knockout [DKO]) hippocampal neurons. However, this was not due to reduced secretion efficiency or neuromodulator vesicle transport but to 40% reduced neuromodulator levels at synapses and 50% reduced delivery of new neuromodulator vesicles to axons. αβCaMKII depletion drastically reduced neuromodulator expression. Blocking BDNF secretion or BDNF scavenging in wild-type neurons produced a similar reduction. Reduced neuromodulator expression in αβCaMKII DKO neurons was restored by active βCaMKII but not inactive βCaMKII or αCaMKII, and by CaMKII downstream effectors that promote cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data indicate that CaMKII regulates neuromodulation in a feedback loop coupling neuromodulator secretion to βCaMKII- and CREB-dependent neuromodulator expression and axonal targeting, but CaMKIIs are dispensable for the secretion process itself.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ioF5P1TIuw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The right temporoparietal junction enables delay of gratification by allowing decision makers to focus on future events</title>

Studies of neural processes underlying delay of gratification usually focus on prefrontal networks related to curbing affective impulses. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative mechanism that facilitates delaying gratification by mental orientation towards the future. Combining continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) with functional neuroimaging, we tested how the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) facilitates processing of future events and thereby promotes delay of gratification. Participants performed an intertemporal decision task and a mental time-travel task in the MRI scanner before and after receiving cTBS over the rTPJ or the vertex (control site). rTPJ cTBS led to both stronger temporal discounting for longer delays and reduced processing of future relative to past events in the mental time-travel task. This finding suggests that the rTPJ contributes to the ability to delay gratification by facilitating mental representation of outcomes in the future. On the neural level, rTPJ cTBS led to a reduction in the extent to which connectivity of rTPJ with striatum reflected the value of delayed rewards, indicating a role of rTPJ–striatum connectivity in constructing neural representations of future rewards. Together, our findings provide evidence that the rTPJ is an integral part of a brain network that promotes delay of gratification by facilitating mental orientation to future rewards.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RqA111s2EcY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs), members of the solute carrier (SLC) 28 transporter family, facilitate the salvage of nucleosides and therapeutic nucleoside derivatives across the plasma membrane. Despite decades of investigation, the structures of human CNTs remain unknown. We determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human CNT (hCNT) 3 at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. As with its bacterial homologs, hCNT3 presents a trimeric architecture with additional N-terminal transmembrane helices to stabilize the conserved central domains. The conserved binding sites for the substrate and sodium ions unravel the selective nucleoside transport and distinct coupling mechanism. Structural comparison of hCNT3 with bacterial homologs indicates that hCNT3 is stabilized in an inward-facing conformation. This study provides the molecular determinants for the transport mechanism of hCNTs and potentially facilitates the design of nucleoside drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zsxneFFEhxI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0d1d5311-1d84-4675-98f1-2cbe3de8896c/jnr24702-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study assesses the reproducibility of previous neuroanatomical findings in Western transgender persons in a Non‐Western population. It then shows that repeating an anatomical MRI sequence can increase data reliability especially in brain regions that have previously been implicated to differ between transgender and cisgender persons. This &lt;i&gt;scan–rescan&lt;/i&gt; method might enhance the power of studies with small samples due to low prevalence of target population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. Moreover, the major body of work has focused on Western populations. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study focused on the structural neuroanatomy of a Non‐Western (Iranian) sample of 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW), while assessing whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including gray matter volume (GMV), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical thickness (CTh) could be increased by using two back‐to‐back within‐session structural MRI scans. Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with sex assigned at birth in GMV and CSA, while no group differences emerged for CTh. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all regions of interest, most notably bilateral frontal poles, pre‐ and postcentral gyri and putamina. The results suggest that a simple time and cost‐effective measure to improve SNR in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Permeability Measures Predict Hemorrhagic Transformation after Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25785?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25785?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to examine the diagnostic utility of existing predictors of any hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and compare them with new perfusion imaging permeability measures in ischemic stroke patients receiving alteplase only.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pixel‐based analysis of pretreatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimal CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to produce an area under the curve (AUC). We compared AUCs using χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 5 centers, 1,407 patients were included in this study; of these, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation cohort (1,025, 70% patients) and a validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The extraction fraction (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;) permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–0.91; validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.86–0.95; validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and parenchymal hematoma showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this large multicenter study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure might be useful in clinical practice to predict hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture and distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mapping of the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferent projections to the anatomically defined active expiratory oscillator in adult male rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mapping of the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferent projections to the anatomically defined active expiratory oscillator in adult male rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d6a24972-872a-4dcc-ab52-46679d4128eb/cne24984-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the afferent projections to the brainstem expiratory oscillator located in the lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). We combined retrograde viruses with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of neurons. pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs that contribute to the modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labeled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labeled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS, and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus&lt;/i&gt;, no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and nonrespiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Antero-Posterior vs. Lateral Vestibular Input Processing in Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00043</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visuo-vestibular integration is crucial for locomotion, yet the cortical mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We combined binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the cortical networks activated during antero-posterior and lateral stimulations in humans. We focused on functional areas that selectively respond to egomotion-consistent optic flow patterns: the human middle temporal complex (hMT+), V6, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area, the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the posterior insular cortex (PIC). Areas hMT+, CSv, and PIC were equivalently responsive during lateral and antero-posterior GVS while areas VIP and V6 were highly activated during antero-posterior GVS, but remained silent during lateral GVS. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we confirmed that a cortical network including areas V6 and VIP is engaged during antero-posterior GVS. Our results suggest that V6 and VIP play a specific role in processing multisensory signals specific to locomotion during navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumenal Indicators in Drosophila Reveal Effects of HSP-Related Mutations on Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genes for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping proteins are among the most commonly mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Mutation of these genes in model organisms can lead to disruption of the ER network. To investigate how the physiological roles of the ER might be affected by such disruption, we developed tools to interrogate its Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling function. We generated GAL4-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors targeted to the ER lumen, to record ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes in identified Drosophila neurons. Using GAL4 lines specific for Type Ib or Type Is larval motor neurons, we compared the responses of different lumenal indicators to electrical stimulation, in axons and presynaptic terminals. The most effective sensor, ER-GCaMP6-210, had a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; affinity close to the expected ER lumenal concentration. Repetitive nerve stimulation generally showed a transient increase of lumenal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in both the axon and presynaptic terminals. Mutants lacking neuronal reticulon and REEP proteins, homologs of human HSP proteins, showed a larger ER lumenal evoked response compared to wild type; we propose mechanisms by which this phenotype could lead to neuronal dysfunction or degeneration. Our lines are useful additions to a Drosophila Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging toolkit, to explore the physiological roles of ER, and its pathophysiological roles in HSP and in axon degeneration more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Distinct Residential and Infiltrated Macrophage Populations and Their Phagocytic Function in Mild and Severe Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00244</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neonatal brain injury, especially severe injury induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI), causes mortality and long-term neurological impairments. Our previous study demonstrated activation of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myeloid cells, including residential microglial cells (MGs) and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in a murine model of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), with unknown functions. Here, we study the differences in the phagocytic function of MGs and MDMs to clarify their potential roles after HIBD. HI was induced in 9–10-day postnatal mice. On days 1 and 3 after injury, pathological and neurobehavioral tests were performed to categorize the brain damage as mild or severe. Flow cytometry was applied to quantify the dynamic change in the numbers of MGs and MDMs according to the relative expression level of CD45 in CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt;CCR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RFP&lt;/sup&gt; double-transformed mice were used to identify MGs and MDMs in the brain parenchyma after HIBD. Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), CD36, and transforming growth factor (TGF-β) expression levels were measured to assess the underlying function of phagocytes and neuroprotective factors in these cells. The FITC-dextran 40 phagocytosis assay was applied to examine the change in phagocytic function under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. We found that neonatal HI induced a different degree of brain damage: mild or severe injury. Compared with mildly injured animals, mice with severe injury had lower weight, worse neurobehavioral scores, and abnormal brain morphology. In a severely injured brain, CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells remarkably increased, including an increase in the MDM population and a decrease in the MG population. Furthermore, MDM infiltration into the brain parenchyma was evident in CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt;CCR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RFP&lt;/sup&gt; double-transformed mice. Mild and severe brain injury caused different phagocytosis-related responses and neuroprotective functions of MDMs and MGs at 1 and 3 days following HI. The phagocytic function was activated in BV2 cells but downregulated in Raw264.7 cells under OGD in vitro. These observations indicate that neonatal HI induced different degrees of brain injury. The proportion of infiltrated macrophage MDMs was increased and they were recruited into the injured brain parenchyma in severe brain injury. The resident macrophage MGs proportion decreased and maintained activated phagocytic function in both mild and severe brain injury, and restored neuroprotective function in severe brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a cardinal event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the structural basis of Aβ-elicited neurotoxicity is unknown. In a recent paper, Ciudad et al. elucidate the first atomic structures of Aβ oligomers, which reveal how they form lipid-stabilized pores that might disrupt neuronal membranes and ion homeostasis.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors in stroke prevention and therapy—The best is yet to come?</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR‐γ, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerous &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, as well as in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis on &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; animal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Slow‐sustained delivery of naloxone reduces typical naloxone‐induced precipitated opioid withdrawal effects in male morphine‐dependent mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/11c60809-f512-4122-9519-cd2403708c5b/jnr24627-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphine‐dependent mice treated with unmodified naloxone exhibit precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) behaviors. POW behaviors observed in morphine‐dependent mice treated with covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NPs) are minimal to none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of individuals die each year from opioid‐related overdoses. While naloxone (Narcan®) is currently the most widely employed treatment to reverse opioid toxicity, high or repeated doses of this antidote often lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). We hypothesized that a slow linear release of naloxone from a nanoparticle would induce fewer POW symptoms compared to high‐dose free naloxone. First, we measured the acute impact of covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NPs) on morphine‐induced antinociception in the hotplate test. We found that Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NP treatment blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine within 15 min of administration. Next, we tested the impact of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NPs on POW symptoms in male morphine‐dependent mice. To induce morphine dependence, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) twice‐daily for six consecutive days. On day 7 mice received 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) injections 2 hr prior to receiving treatment of either unmodified free naloxone, a high or low dose of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NP, empty nanoparticle (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NP‐empty), or saline. Behavior was analyzed for 0–6 hr followed by 24 and 48 hr time points after treatment. As expected, free naloxone induced a significant increase in POW behavior in morphine‐dependent mice compared to saline‐treated mice upon free naloxone administration. In comparison, reduced POW behavior was observed with both doses of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NP. Side effects of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;NP on locomotion and fecal boli production were measured and no significant side‐effects were observed. Overall, our data show that sustained release of naloxone from a covalent nanoparticle does not induce severe POW symptoms in morphine‐dependent mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitation in the face of plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Bella Naumann, Henning Sprekeler&lt;/p&gt;

Hebbian plasticity, a mechanism believed to be the substrate of learning and memory, detects and further enhances correlated neural activity. Because this constitutes an unstable positive feedback loop, it requires additional homeostatic control. Computational work suggests that in recurrent networks, the homeostatic mechanisms observed in experiments are too slow to compensate instabilities arising from Hebbian plasticity and need to be complemented by rapid compensatory processes. We suggest presynaptic inhibition as a candidate that rapidly provides stability by compensating recurrent excitation induced by Hebbian changes. Presynaptic inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors that effectively and reversibly attenuate transmitter release. Activation of these receptors can be triggered by excess network activity, hence providing a stabilising negative feedback loop that weakens recurrent interactions on sub-second timescales. We study the stabilising effect of presynaptic inhibition in a recurrent networks, in which presynaptic inhibition is implemented as a multiplicative reduction of recurrent synaptic weights in response to increasing inhibitory activity. We show that networks with presynaptic inhibition display a gradual increase of firing rates with growing excitatory weights, in contrast to traditional excitatory-inhibitory networks. This alleviates the positive feedback loop between Hebbian plasticity and network activity and thereby allows homeostasis to act on timescales similar to those observed in experiments. Our results generalise to spiking networks with a biophysically more detailed implementation of the presynaptic inhibition mechanism. In conclusion, presynaptic inhibition provides a powerful compensatory mechanism that rapidly reduces effective recurrent interactions and thereby stabilises Hebbian learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8M0a75I0Uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Drug repurposing, identifying novel indications for drugs, bypasses common drug development pitfalls to ultimately deliver therapies to patients faster. However, most repurposing discoveries have been led by anecdotal observations (e.g. Viagra) or experimental-based repurposing screens, which are costly, time-consuming, and imprecise. Recently, more systematic computational approaches have been proposed, however these rely on utilizing the information from the diseases a drug is already approved to treat. This inherently limits the algorithms, making them unusable for investigational molecules. Here, we present a computational approach to drug repurposing, CATNIP, that requires only biological and chemical information of a molecule. CATNIP is trained with 2,576 diverse small molecules and uses 16 different drug similarity features, such as structural, target, or pathway based similarity. This model obtains significant predictive power (AUC = 0.841). Using our model, we created a repurposing network to identify broad scale repurposing opportunities between drug types. By exploiting this network, we identified literature-supported repurposing candidates, such as the use of systemic hormonal preparations for the treatment of respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that we can use our approach to identify novel uses for defined drug classes. We found that adrenergic uptake inhibitors, specifically amitriptyline and trimipramine, could be potential therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, using CATNIP, we predicted the kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, as a possible treatment for Type 2 Diabetes. Overall, this systematic approach to drug repurposing lays the groundwork to streamline future drug development efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GaN2Ncpsy4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The brain consists of many interconnected networks with time-varying, partially autonomous activity. There are multiple sources of noise and variation yet activity has to eventually converge to a stable, reproducible state (or sequence of states) for its computations to make sense. We approached this problem from a control-theory perspective by applying contraction analysis to recurrent neural networks. This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving stability in multiple connected networks with biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms included inhibitory Hebbian plasticity, excitatory anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Our findings shed light on how stable computations might be achieved despite biological complexity. Crucially, our analysis is not limited to analyzing the stability of fixed geometric objects in state space (e.g points, lines, planes), but rather the stability of state trajectories which may be complex and time-varying.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/660jkWwn5gk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Pain‐induced alterations in the dynorphinergic system within the mesocorticolimbic pathway: Implication for alcohol addiction</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latest studies have revealed that pain negatively impacts on reward processing and motivation leading to negative affective states and stress. These states not only reduce quality of life of patients by increasing the appearance of psychiatric comorbidities, but also have an important impact on vulnerability to drug abuse, including alcohol. In fact, clinical, epidemiological but also preclinical studies have revealed that the presence of pain is closely related to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). All this evidence suggests that pain is a factor that increases the risk of suffering AUD, predicting heavy drinking behavior and relapse drinking in those patients with a previous history of AUD. The negative consequences of chronic pain and its impact on stress and AUD are likely mediated by alterations in the central nervous system, especially in the stress and reward systems. Therefore, pain and stress impact on dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway can lead to an increase in drug abuse liability. In this mini review we analyze the interaction between pain, stress, and alcohol addiction, and how dynamic changes in the kappa opioid system might play a crucial role in the development of compulsive alcohol drinking in chronic pain patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Pain management with opioids in adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the ubiquitous nature of opioids in the treatment of pain, it is an interesting paradox that this class of medications also represents one of the least understood components of clinical pain medicine. For many years, there has been intense interest in the mechanisms of opioid activity, but this has not resulted in a corresponding increase in convincing clinical data. This review focuses primarily on the evidence surrounding the long‐term use of opioids in chronic pain, but discussions of this research are often conflated with the very different data governing acute and cancer‐related pain, where evidence of efficacy is clearer. It is therefore important to clarify the evidence‐based indications for opioid therapy. There remains very little evidence that opioids improve function or quality of life beyond 3 months in people with chronic pain conditions. In all three patient populations, the development of tolerance, dependence, hyperalgesia and withdrawal are key phenomena that affect the patient experience, and in particular the decision to remain on opioids in the long term. This is a common thread that connects the opioid literature in all of these spheres, and justifies the burgeoning interest in these phenomena in the basic science literature. There is an urgent need to address these negative consequences of opioid use, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit that opioids can offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Optic Disc Classification by Deep Learning versus Expert Neuro‐Ophthalmologists</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25839?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25839?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system correctly classified 678 of 800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675 of 800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641 of 800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96–0.98), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94–0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.87–0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema, and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar to or better than the 2 experts. Intergrader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.67–0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.68–0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.61–0.70) between the system and Expert 2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anti‐migraine Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide Receptor Antagonists Worsen Cerebral Ischemic Outcome in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25831?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25831?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP‐mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12 to 60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow, and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1–1mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10–100mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olcegepant (1mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12‐ to 20‐minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 vs 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk = 2.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score = 9 vs 5 with vehicle, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) after 60‐minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1 to 1mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20‐minute ischemia (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03); 100mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60‐minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1mg/kg increased infarct size after 30‐minute occlusion (1.6‐fold, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10‐fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse aorta.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cortical Inactivation Does Not Block Response Enhancement in the Superior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00059</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive visual stimulation is successfully used in a study on the visual evoked potential (VEP) plasticity in the visual system in mammals. Practicing visual tasks or repeated exposure to sensory stimuli can induce neuronal network changes in the cortical circuits and improve the perception of these stimuli. However, little is known about the effect of visual training at the subcortical level. In the present study, we extend the knowledge showing positive results of this training in the rat’s Superior colliculus (SC). In electrophysiological experiments, we showed that a single training session lasting several hours induces a response enhancement both in the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the SC. Further, we tested if collicular responses will be enhanced without V1 input. For this reason, we inactivated the V1 by applying xylocaine solution onto the cortical surface during visual training. Our results revealed that SC’s response enhancement was present even without V1 inputs and showed no difference in amplitude comparing to VEPs enhancement while the V1 was active. These data suggest that the visual system plasticity and facilitation can develop independently but simultaneously in different parts of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Critical Analysis on Characterizing the Meditation Experience Through the Electroencephalogram</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation practices, originated from ancient traditions, have increasingly received attention due to their potential benefits to mental and physical health. The scientific community invests efforts into scrutinizing and quantifying the effects of these practices, especially on the brain. There are methodological challenges in describing the neural correlates of the subjective experience of meditation. We noticed, however, that technical considerations on signal processing also don't follow standardized approaches, which may hinder generalizations. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the usage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to study meditation experiences in healthy individuals. We describe the main EEG signal processing techniques and how they have been translated to the meditation field until April 2020. Moreover, we examine in detail the limitations/assumptions of these techniques and highlight some good practices, further discussing how technical specifications may impact the interpretation of the outcomes. By shedding light on technical features, this article contributes to more rigorous approaches to evaluate the construct of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Accounting for Changing Structure in Functional Network Analysis of TBI Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, network analysis approaches based on MR data have allowed a renewed understanding of the relationship between brain function architecture and consciousness. Application of this approach to Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) highlights the relationship between specific aspects of network topology and levels of consciousness. Nonetheless, such applications do not acknowledge that DOC patients present with a dramatic level of heterogeneity in structural connectivity (SC) across groups (e.g., etiology, diagnostic categories) and within individual patients (e.g., over time), which possibly affects the level and quality of functional connectivity (FC) patterns that can be expressed. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that the most frequently employed outcome metrics in the study of brain connectivity (e.g., degree distribution, inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity, and clustering coefficient) are interrelated and cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. We present empirical data showing that, when the two points above are not taken into consideration with an appropriate analytic model, it can lead to a misinterpretation of the role of each outcome metric in the graph's structure and thus misinterpretation of FC results. We show that failing to account for either SC or the inter-relation between outcome measures can lead to inflated false positives (FP) and/or false negatives (FN) in inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity results (defined, respectively, as a positive or negative result in network connectivity that is present when not accounting for SC and/or outcome measure inter-relation, but becomes not significant when accounting for all variables). Overall, we find that unconscious patients have lower rates of FP and FN for within cortical connectivity, lower rates of FN for cortico-subcortical connectivity, and lower rates of FP for within subcortical connectivity. These lower rates in unconscious patients may reflect differences in their triadic closure and SC metrics, which bias the interpretations of the inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity if the SC metrics and triadic closure are not modeled. We suggest that future studies of functional connectivity in DOC patients (i) incorporate where possible SC metrics and (ii) properly account for the intercorrelated nature of outcome variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: SNARE-Mediated Exocytosis in Neuronal Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The formation of the nervous system involves establishing complex networks of synaptic connections between proper partners. This developmental undertaking requires the rapid expansion of the plasma membrane surface area as neurons grow and polarize, extending axons through the extracellular environment. Critical to the expansion of the plasma membrane and addition of plasma membrane material is exocytic vesicle fusion, a regulated mechanism driven by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNAREs). Since their discovery, SNAREs have been implicated in several critical neuronal functions involving exocytic fusion in addition to synaptic transmission, including neurite initiation and outgrowth, axon specification, axon extension, and synaptogenesis. Decades of research have uncovered a rich variety of SNARE expression and function. The basis of SNARE-mediated fusion, the opening of a fusion pore, remains an enigmatic event, despite an incredible amount of research, as fusion is not only heterogeneous but also spatially small and temporally fast. Multiple modes of exocytosis have been proposed, with full-vesicle fusion (FFV) and kiss-and-run (KNR) being the best described. Whereas most in vitro work has reconstituted fusion using VAMP-2, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1; there is much to learn regarding the behaviors of distinct SNARE complexes. In the past few years, robust heterogeneity in the kinetics and fate of the fusion pore that varies by cell type have been uncovered, suggesting a paradigm shift in how the modes of exocytosis are viewed is warranted. Here, we explore both classic and recent work uncovering the variety of SNAREs and their importance in the development of neurons, as well as historical and newly proposed modes of exocytosis, their regulation, and proteins involved in the regulation of fusion kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine replacement therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the only temporary therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it triggers dyskinesia over time. Since dyskinesia is associated with increased neuronal firing that bolsters purinergic signaling, we now tested whether the selective and blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue-G (BBG, 22.5–45 mg/kg ip) attenuated behavioral, neurochemical and biochemical alterations in rats turned hemiparkinsonian upon unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and treated daily with L-DOPA (30 mg/kg by gavage) for 22 days. The blockade of P2X7 receptors decreased L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and motor incoordination in hemiparkinsonian rats. In parallel, BBG treatment rebalanced the altered dopamine D1 and D2 receptor density and signaling as well as some neuroinflammation-associated parameters in the striatum and substantia nigra. These findings herald a hitherto unrecognized role for purinergic signaling in the etiopathology of dyskinesia and prompt P2X7 receptor antagonists as novel candidate anti-dyskinesia drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Volume conduction of electrical potentials in the brain is highly influenced by the material properties and geometry of the tissue and recording devices implanted into the tissue. These effects are very large in EEG due to the volume conduction through the skull and scalp but are often neglected in intracranial electrophysiology. When considering penetrating electrodes deep in the brain, the assumption of an infinite and homogenous medium can be used when the sources are far enough from the brain surface and the electrodes to minimize the boundary effect. When the electrodes are recording from the brain's surface the effect of the boundary cannot be neglected, and the large surface area and commonly used insulating materials in surface electrode arrays may further increase the effect by altering the nature of the boundary in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. This gives the experimenter some control over the spatial profiles of the potentials by appropriate design of the electrode arrays. We construct a simple three-layer model to describe the effect of material properties and geometry above the brain surface on the electric potentials and conduct empirical experiments to validate this model. A laminar electrode array is used to measure the effect of insulating and relatively conducting layers above the cortical surface by recording evoked potentials alternating between a dried surface and saline covering layer, respectively. Empirically, we find that an insulating boundary amplifies the potentials relative to conductive saline by about a factor of 4, and that the effect is not constrained to potentials that originate near the surface.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the release of the multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, many researchers have applied machine learning methods to distinguish between healthy subjects and autistic individuals by using features extracted from resting state functional MRI data. An important part of applying machine learning to this problem is extracting these features. Specifically, whether to include negative correlations between brain region activities as relevant features and how best to define these features. For the second question, the graph theoretical properties of the brain network may provide a reasonable answer. In this study, we investigated the first issue by comparing three different approaches. These included using the positive correlation matrix (comprising only the positive values of the original correlation matrix), the absolute value of the correlation matrix, or the anticorrelation matrix (comprising only the negative correlation values) as the starting point for extracting relevant features using graph theory. We then trained a multi-layer perceptron in a leave-one-site out manner in which the data from a single site was left out as testing data and the model was trained on the data from the other sites. Our results show that on average, using graph features extracted from the anti-correlation matrix led to the highest accuracy and AUC scores. This suggests that anti-correlations should not simply be discarded as they may include useful information that would aid the classification task. We also show that adding the PCA transformation of the original correlation matrix to the feature space leads to an increase in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The growing importance of astrocytes in the field of neuroscience has led to a greater number of computational models devoted to the study of astrocytic functions and their metabolic interactions with neurons. The modeling of these interactions demands a combined understanding of brain physiology and the development of computational frameworks based on genomic-scale reconstructions, system biology, and dynamic models. These computational approaches have helped to highlight the neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by astrocytes and other glial cells, both under normal conditions and during neurodegenerative processes. In the present review, we evaluate some of the most relevant models of astrocyte metabolism, including genome-scale reconstructions and astrocyte-neuron interactions developed in the last few years. Additionally, we discuss novel strategies from the multi-omics perspective and computational models of other glial cell types that will increase our knowledge in brain metabolism and its association with neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Tomographic Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEGt) toolbox is integrated with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Neuroinformatics Ecosystem as a docker into the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN). qEEGt produces age-corrected normative Statistical Parametric Maps of EEG log source spectra testing compliance to a normative database. This toolbox was developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center as part of the first wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) and has been validated and used in different health systems for several decades. Incorporation into the MNI ecosystem now provides CBRAIN registered users access to its full functionality and is accompanied by a public release of the source code on GitHub and Zenodo repositories. Among other features are the calculation of EEG scalp spectra, and the estimation of their source spectra using the Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography (VARETA) source imaging. Crucially, this is completed by the evaluation of z spectra by means of the built-in age regression equations obtained from the CHBMP database (ages 5–87) to provide normative Statistical Parametric Mapping of EEG log source spectra. Different scalp and source visualization tools are also provided for evaluation of individual subjects prior to further post-processing. Openly releasing this software in the CBRAIN platform will facilitate the use of standardized qEEGt methods in different research and clinical settings. An updated precis of the methods is provided in Appendix I as a reference for the toolbox. qEEGt/CBRAIN is the first installment of instruments developed by the neuroinformatic platform of the Cuba-Canada-China (CCC) project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Sparse Logistic Regression With L1/2 Penalty for Emotion Recognition in Electroencephalography Classification</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a current focus in brain-computer interface research. However, the classification of EEG is difficult owing to large amounts of data and high levels of noise. Therefore, it is important to determine how to effectively extract features that include important information. Regularization, one of the effective methods for EEG signal processing, can effectively extract important features from the signal and has potential applications in EEG emotion recognition. Currently, the most popular regularization technique is Lasso (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and Ridge Regression (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In recent years, researchers have proposed many other regularization terms. In theory, L&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-type regularization has a lower q value, which means that it can be used to find solutions with better sparsity. L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; regularization is of L&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; type (0 &amp;lt; q &amp;lt; 1) and has been shown to have many attractive properties. In this work, we studied the L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty in sparse logistic regression for three-classification EEG emotion recognition, and used a coordinate descent algorithm and a univariate semi-threshold operator to implement L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty logistic regression. The experimental results on simulation and real data demonstrate that our proposed method is better than other existing regularization methods. Sparse logistic regression with L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty achieves higher classification accuracy than the conventional L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net regularization methods, using fewer but more informative EEG signals. This is very important for high-dimensional small-sample EEG data and can help researchers to reduce computational complexity and improve computational accuracy. Therefore, we propose that sparse logistic regression with the L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty is an effective technique for emotion recognition in practical classification problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: What Direct Electrostimulation of the Brain Taught Us About the Human Connectome: A Three-Level Model of Neural Disruption</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00315</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00315</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the relevance of the information provided by direct electrostimulation (DES) for mapping brain functions was debated. Recently, major advances in intraoperative DES for guiding resection of cerebral tumors in awake patients enabled the validation of this method and its increased utilization in basic neurosciences. Indeed, in addition to the cortical stimulation used for many decades in epilepsy surgery, axonal mapping was developed thanks to DES of the white matter tracts, giving original insights into the neural connectivity. Moreover, functional results collected during intrasurgical mapping have been correlated with neuropsychological performances before and after DES-guided resection, and with perioperative neuroimaging data. Thus, it was evidenced that DES offers the unique opportunity to identify both cortical and subcortical structures critical for cerebral functions. Here, the first aim is to propose a three-level model of DES-generated functional disruption, able to explain the behavioral consequences elicited during awake surgery, i.e., (i) DES of an input/output unimodal (e.g., somatosensory or motor) network inducing “positive” responses (as involuntary movement); (ii) DES of a distributed specialized network inducing a within-system disruption leading to specific “negative” disorders (e.g., exclusive language deficit with no other disorders); (iii) DES generating an inter-system disruption leading to more complex behavioral disturbances (e.g., the inability to perform dual-task while each function can be performed separately). Second, in light of this model, original findings gained from DES concerning the human connectome, complementary to those provided by functional neuroimaging (FNI), are reviewed. Further longitudinal multimodal investigations are needed to explore neuroplasticity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Field Theory of Evoked Response Potentials With Attentional Gain Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00293</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Optimal Self-Induced Stochastic Resonance in Multiplex Neural Networks: Electrical vs. Chemical Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00062</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical and chemical synapses shape the dynamics of neural networks, and their functional roles in information processing have been a longstanding question in neurobiology. In this paper, we investigate the role of synapses on the optimization of the phenomenon of self-induced stochastic resonance in a delayed multiplex neural network by using analytical and numerical methods. We consider a two-layer multiplex network in which, at the intra-layer level, neurons are coupled either by electrical synapses or by inhibitory chemical synapses. For each isolated layer, computations indicate that weaker electrical and chemical synaptic couplings are better optimizers of self-induced stochastic resonance. In addition, regardless of the synaptic strengths, shorter electrical synaptic delays are found to be better optimizers of the phenomenon than shorter chemical synaptic delays, while longer chemical synaptic delays are better optimizers than longer electrical synaptic delays; in both cases, the poorer optimizers are, in fact, worst. It is found that electrical, inhibitory, or excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only electrical synapses at the intra-layer levels can each optimize the phenomenon. Additionally, only excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only inhibitory chemical synapses at the intra-layer levels can optimize the phenomenon. These results may guide experiments aimed at establishing or confirming to the mechanism of self-induced stochastic resonance in networks of artificial neural circuits as well as in real biological neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Type 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells Accumulate in the Brain After Hypoxia-Ischemia but Do Not Contribute to the Development of Preterm Brain Injury</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The immune system of human and mouse neonates is relatively immature. However, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), commonly divided into the subsets ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, are already present in the placenta and other fetal compartments and exhibit higher activity than what is seen in adulthood. Recent reports have suggested the potential role of ILCs, especially ILC2s, in spontaneous preterm labor, which is associated with brain damage and subsequent long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Therefore, we hypothesized that ILCs, and especially ILC2s, play a role in preterm brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;C57Bl/6J mice at postnatal day 6 were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) insult induced by left carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 10% oxygen in nitrogen. The presence of ILCs and ILC2s in the brain was examined at different time points after HI. The contribution of ILC2s to HI-induced preterm brain damage was explored using a conditionally targeted ILC2-deficient mouse strain (Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;), and gray and white-matter injury were evaluated at 7 days post-HI. The inflammatory response in the injured brain was assessed using immunoassays and immunochemistry staining.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant increases in ILCs and ILC2s were observed at 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days post-HI in the injured brain hemisphere compared with the uninjured hemisphere in wild-type mice. ILC2s in the brain were predominantly located in the meninges of the injured ipsilateral hemispheres after HI but not in the brain parenchyma. Overall, we did not observe changes in cytokine/chemokine levels in the brains of Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with wild type animals apart from IL-13. Gray and white-matter tissue loss in the brain was not affected after HI in Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Correspondingly, we did not find any differences in reactive microglia and astrocyte numbers in the brain in Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with wild-type mice following HI insult.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;After HI, ILCs and ILC2s accumulate in the injured brain hemisphere. However, ILC2s do not contribute to the development of brain damage in this mouse model of preterm brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Membrane tethering is an important communication method for membrane-packaged organelles. Mitochondria are organelles with a bilayer membrane, and the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles is indispensable for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Increased levels of molecular determinants that mediate the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles, and their functions, have been revealed in recent years. In this review article, we aim to summarize the findings on the tethering between mitochondria and other organelles in physiological or pathological conditions, and discuss their roles in cellular homeostasis, neural activity, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cerebral Arterial Pulsatility and Global White Matter Microstructure Impact Spatial Working Memory in Older Adults With and Without Cardiovascular Risk Factors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00245</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00245</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with an increased prevalence of vascular health conditions that are linked to a disruption in the cerebral vasculature and white matter microstructural organization. In people with cardiovascular risk factors, increased cerebral arterial pulsatility is associated with poorer white matter microstructural organization and cognitive functioning. This study examines the relationship among arterial pulsatility, white matter microstructural organization, and cognitive ability in a healthy adult lifespan sample. One hundred and eighty-nine adults were divided into a younger adult (&amp;lt;50 years, n = 97) and older adult (&amp;gt;50 years, n = 92). The latter were further subdivided into two subgroups with (CV+, n = 25) and without (CV−, n = 67) cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial pulsatility was measured using cardiac-gated phase-contrast flow quantification sequence and three indexes of whole-brain white matter microstructural organization [i.e., fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RaD), mean diffusivity (MD)] were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Cognitive ability was assessed using global cognitive functioning (MoCA) and a measure of working memory [sensitivity (d′) from a 2-back task]. Neither the whole group analysis nor the younger adult group showed an association between measures of arterial pulsatility, global white matter microstructural organization, and cognition. In older adults, higher MD and RaD were associated with increased arterial pulsatility and poorer working memory performance. The indirect pathway from arterial pulsatility to working memory performance via both MD and RaD measures was significant in this group. Interestingly, a comparison of CV+ and CV− subgroups showed that this mediating relationship was only evident in older adults with at least one CV risk factor. These findings are consistent with cardiovascular risk factors as underlying arterial, white matter, and cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Transmembrane Protein 230 Mediates a Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1-Linked Apoptosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in transmembrane protein 230 (TMEM230) gene are suggested to be associated with the autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease (PD) with typical movement disorders and Lewy body pathology. However, the normal functions and the pathological roles of TMEM230 are not clear. In this study, we used TMEM230 isoform II constructs including wild-type (WT) and four reported PD-linked mutation constructs (Y92C, R141L, 184Wext*5, and 184PGext*5). Ectopic expression of WT and PD-linked mutant TMEM230 variants in cultured cells dramatically induced apoptotic cell death compared with that of vector control cells. Mutant TMEM230 caused cell toxicity at an increased severity than WT TMEM230. Moreover, expression of TMEM230 increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreased cellular ATP, activated caspase 3/7, and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) cleavage. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an ROS scavenger) or Z-VAD-FMK (a caspase inhibitor) significantly attenuated TMEM230-induced apoptosis in both cultured cells and primary neurons. Our results indicated that TMEM230 mediated a PARP1-linked apoptotic cell death pathway. These findings not only provide the novel insight into the biological roles of TMEM230 in the PARP1-linked pathway but also provide a TMEM230-induced cell death mechanism underlying PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effect of magnitude and variability of energy of activation in multisite ultrasensitive biochemical processes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Leonila Lagunes, Lee Bardwell, German A. Enciso&lt;/p&gt;

Protein activity is often regulated by ligand binding or by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Moreover, proteins that are regulated in this way often contain multiple ligand binding sites or modification sites, which can operate to create an ultrasensitive dose response. Here, we consider the contribution of the individual modification/binding sites to the activation process, and how their individual values affect the ultrasensitive behavior of the overall system. We use a generalized Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model that allows for variable conformational free energy contributions from distinct sites, and associate a so-called activation parameter to each site. Our analysis shows that the ultrasensitivity generally increases as the conformational free energy contribution from one or more sites is strengthen. Furthermore, ultrasensitivity depends on the mean of the activation parameters and not on their variability. In some cases, we find that the best way to maximize ultrasensitivity is to make the contribution from all sites as strong as possible. These results provide insights into the performance objectives of multiple modification/binding sites and thus help gain a greater understanding of signaling and its role in diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJBqMdkzcCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Radiotherapy is a commonly used conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Cytotoxicity limits the use of this life-saving therapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we use the syngeneic mouse BMT model to test the hypothesis that lethal radiation damages tissues, thereby unleashing signals that indiscriminately activate the inflammasome pathways in host and transplanted cells. We find that a clinically relevant high dose of radiation causes severe damage to bones and the spleen through mechanisms involving the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes but not the NLRC4 inflammasome. Downstream, we demonstrate that gasdermin D (GSDMD), the common effector of the inflammasomes, is also activated by radiation. Remarkably, protection against the injury induced by deadly ionizing radiation occurs only when NLRP3, AIM2, or GSDMD is lost simultaneously in both the donor and host cell compartments. Thus, this study reveals a continuum of the actions of lethal radiation relayed by the inflammasome-GSDMD axis, initially affecting recipient cells and ultimately harming transplanted cells as they grow in the severely injured and toxic environment. This study also suggests that therapeutic targeting of inflammasome-GSDMD signaling has the potential to prevent the collateral effects of intense radiation regimens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2JzKjJWvFho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dynamic centriolar localization of Polo and Centrobin in early mitosis primes centrosome asymmetry</title>

Centrosomes, the main microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) of metazoan cells, contain an older “mother” and a younger “daughter” centriole. Stem cells either inherit the mother or daughter-centriole-containing centrosome, providing a possible mechanism for biased delivery of cell fate determinants. However, the mechanisms regulating centrosome asymmetry and biased centrosome segregation are unclear. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and live-cell imaging, we show in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts) that the mitotic kinase Polo and its centriolar protein substrate Centrobin (Cnb) accumulate on the daughter centriole during mitosis, thereby generating molecularly distinct mother and daughter centrioles before interphase. Cnb’s asymmetric localization, potentially involving a direct relocalization mechanism, is regulated by Polo-mediated phosphorylation, whereas Polo’s daughter centriole enrichment requires both Wdr62 and Cnb. Based on optogenetic protein mislocalization experiments, we propose that the establishment of centriole asymmetry in mitosis primes biased interphase MTOC activity, necessary for correct spindle orientation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nIq8ciYcrXg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intact Brain Network Function in an Unresponsive Patient with COVID‐19</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remain unresponsive after surviving critical illness. Although several structural brain abnormalities have been described, their impact on brain function and implications for prognosis are unknown. Functional neuroimaging, which has prognostic significance, has yet to be explored in this population. Here we describe a patient with severe COVID‐19 who, despite prolonged unresponsiveness and structural brain abnormalities, demonstrated intact functional network connectivity, and weeks later recovered the ability to follow commands. When prognosticating for survivors of severe COVID‐19, clinicians should consider that brain networks may remain functionally intact despite structural injury and prolonged unresponsiveness.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Location and arrangement of campaniform sensilla in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Location and arrangement of campaniform sensilla in Drosophila melanogaster&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/651eb958-2de2-4e93-affa-7ed07ab4034f/cne24987-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/93c200b1-1f70-4b8b-8f64-56e5d3153254/jnr24707-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole to aromatase in the brain is best done using the two‐tissue reversible compartment model, or the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as reference region. Receptor parametric mapping and Logan reference tissue model are suitable for parametric mapping. One hour of data acquisition is sufficient for the quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; at the voxel level. As PET tracer, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue‐based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies have identified variants in the LRRK2 gene as important components of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathobiology. Biochemical and emergent biomarker studies have coalesced around LRRK2 hyperactivation in disease. Therapeutics that diminish LRRK2 activity, either with small molecule kinase inhibitors or anti-sense oligonucleotides, have recently advanced to the clinic. Historically, there have been few successes in the development of therapies that might slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past few decades of biomedical research, retrospective analyses suggest the broad integration of informative biomarkers early in development tends to distinguish successful pipelines from those that fail early. Herein, we discuss the biomarker regulatory process, emerging LRRK2 biomarker candidates, assays, underlying biomarker biology, and clinical integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cross Talk Between Ferroptosis and Cerebral Ischemia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00776</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00776</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, ferroptosis has been revealed as a new form of regulated cell death. Distinct from apoptosis and necrosis, ferroptosis is evoked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the metabolism of iron, lipids, and amino acids plays a significant regulatory role in ferroptosis, which can be reversed by glutathione peroxidase 4 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Ferroptosis is implicated in the onset and development of numerous neurological diseases. Emerging studies have reported that ferroptosis induces and aggravates brain tissue damage following cerebral ischemia, whereas inhibition of ferroptosis dramatically attenuates induced damage. In this review, we have summarized the mechanistic relationship between ferroptosis and cerebral ischemia, including through iron overload, downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4, and upregulation of lipid peroxidation. Although considerable attention has been paid to the effect of ferroptosis on cerebral ischemic injury, specific mechanisms need to be experimentally confirmed, including how cerebral ischemia induces ferroptosis and how ferroptosis deteriorates cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Blood-Brain Barrier: More Contributor to Disruption of Central Nervous System Homeostasis Than Victim in Neurological Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic but solid shield in the cerebral microvascular system. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by regulating the exchange of materials between the circulation and the brain and protects the neural tissue from neurotoxic components as well as pathogens. Here, we discuss the development of the BBB in physiological conditions and then focus on the role of the BBB in cerebrovascular disease, including acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Finally, we summarize recent advancements in the development of therapies targeting the BBB and outline future directions and outstanding questions in the field. We propose that BBB dysfunction not only results from, but is causal in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders; the BBB is more a contributor to the disruption of CNS homeostasis than a victim in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Sleep Disturbances and Sleep Disordered Breathing Impair Cognitive Performance in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances and impairment of cognitive function are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with negative implications on quality of life of patients and caregivers. Despite the fact that sleep disturbances are a major issue in PD patients, only limited data are available regarding interactions of sleep disturbances and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This post hoc analysis of the RaSPar trial was therefore designed to further elucidate sleep disturbances and their impact on cognition in PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six PD patients with sleep disturbances were evaluated thoroughly including assessments of patients’ subjective and objective sleep quality by interview, questionnaires, and polysomnography (PSG). Cognitive performance was assessed by Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA) and Test of Attentional Performance (TAP), and associations of sleep and cognitive function were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We did not detect differences in cognitive performance between patients with and without rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Instead, cognitive impairment, particularly affecting cognitive domains attention, executive function/working memory, and semantic memory, was associated with impaired PSG-measured sleep quality (e.g., sleep efficiency) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (Apnea-Hypopnea Index &amp;gt; 5/h). Global cognitive performance was decreased in patients with SDB (PANDA score 23.2 ± 3.5 vs. 26.9 ± 2.2, P = 0.020, unpaired two-sided t-test).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances impair cognitive performance in PD and should be evaluated in routine care, and treatment options such as continuous airway pressure therapy should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Economical Assessment of Working Memory and Response Inhibition in ADHD Using a Combined n-back/Nogo Paradigm: An ERP Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of cognitive interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often requires the assessment of multiple cognitive functions. However, experimental settings consisting of various tasks are particularly strenuous for patients and can thus result in poor data quality. For the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition, this study aims to validate a combined n-back/nogo paradigm by comparing it to single task versions and to demonstrate its applicability for ADHD research. Twenty-five healthy individuals and 34 ADHD patients between 9 and 16 years participated in this event-related potential (ERP) study. Healthy controls underwent single task versions of a 2-back working memory task and a go/nogo response inhibition task as well as the introduced combined 2-back/nogo task. This combined task demonstrated a comparable ERP structure for working memory and response inhibition aspects as single task versions. Behaviorally, higher working memory performance during the combined paradigm indicated lower task difficulty, while high correlations between combined and single task versions still indicated valid working memory measures. For response inhibition performance, different task versions resulted in similar outcomes. The application of the combined n-back/nogo paradigm in ADHD patients revealed the expected working memory and response inhibition deficits, increased omission errors, reaction times, and standard deviation of reaction time, as well as diminished n-back P3 and nogo P3 amplitudes. We conclude that the combined n-back/nogo task is an effective paradigm for the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition deficits in ADHD on a behavioral and neurophysiological level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Predicting Motor Imagery Performance From Resting-State EEG Using Dynamic Causal Modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00321</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00321</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery-based brain–computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines—but does not perform—a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as “BCI-inefficiency,” in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1: r = 0.54; Session 2: r = 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared = 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergence of Stable Synaptic Clusters on Dendrites Through Synaptic Rewiring</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The connectivity structure of neuronal networks in cortex is highly dynamic. This ongoing cortical rewiring is assumed to serve important functions for learning and memory. We analyze in this article a model for the self-organization of synaptic inputs onto dendritic branches of pyramidal cells. The model combines a generic stochastic rewiring principle with a simple synaptic plasticity rule that depends on local dendritic activity. In computer simulations, we find that this synaptic rewiring model leads to synaptic clustering, that is, temporally correlated inputs become locally clustered on dendritic branches. This empirical finding is backed up by a theoretical analysis which shows that rewiring in our model favors network configurations with synaptic clustering. We propose that synaptic clustering plays an important role in the organization of computation and memory in cortical circuits: we find that synaptic clustering through the proposed rewiring mechanism can serve as a mechanism to protect memories from subsequent modifications on a medium time scale. Rewiring of synaptic connections onto specific dendritic branches may thus counteract the general problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: New Optical Tools to Study Neural Circuit Assembly in the Retina</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During development, neurons navigate a tangled thicket of thousands of axons and dendrites to synapse with just a few specific targets. This phenomenon termed wiring specificity, is critical to the assembly of neural circuits and the way neurons manage this feat is only now becoming clear. Recent studies in the mouse retina are shedding new insight into this process. They show that specific wiring arises through a series of stages that include: directed axonal and dendritic growth, the formation of neuropil layers, positioning of such layers, and matching of co-laminar synaptic partners. Each stage appears to be directed by a distinct family of recognition molecules, suggesting that the combinatorial expression of such family members might act as a blueprint for retinal connectivity. By reviewing the evidence in support of each stage, and by considering their underlying molecular mechanisms, we attempt to synthesize these results into a wiring model which generates testable predictions for future studies. Finally, we conclude by highlighting new optical methods that could be used to address such predictions and gain further insight into this fundamental process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Developmentally Regulated Rebound Depolarization Enhances Spike Timing Precision in Auditory Midbrain Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus (IC) is an auditory midbrain structure involved in processing biologically important temporal features of sounds. The responses of IC neurons to these temporal features reflect an interaction of synaptic inputs and neuronal biophysical properties. One striking biophysical property of IC neurons is the rebound depolarization produced following membrane hyperpolarization. To understand how the rebound depolarization is involved in spike timing, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from IC neurons in brain slices of P9–21 rats. We found that the percentage of rebound neurons was developmentally regulated. The precision of the timing of the first spike on the rebound increased when the neuron was repetitively injected with a depolarizing current following membrane hyperpolarization. The average jitter of the first spikes was only 0.5 ms. The selective T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel antagonist, mibefradil, significantly increased the jitter of the first spike of neurons in response to repetitive depolarization following membrane hyperpolarization. Furthermore, the rebound was potentiated by one to two preceding rebounds within a few hundred milliseconds. The first spike generated on the potentiated rebound was more precise than that on the non-potentiated rebound. With the addition of a calcium chelator, BAPTA, into the cell, the rebound potentiation no longer occurred, and the precision of the first spike on the rebound was not improved. These results suggest that the postinhibitory rebound mediated by T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel promotes spike timing precision in IC neurons. The rebound potentiation and precise spikes may be induced by increases in intracellular calcium levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Insight Into the Role of Ferroptosis in Non-neoplastic Neurological Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferroptosis is significantly different from other types of cell death including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, both in morphology and biochemical characteristics. The mechanisms that are associated with ferroptosis include iron metabolism, lipid oxidation, and other pathophysiological changes. Ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors can influence its occurrence through different pathways. Ferroptosis was initially discovered in tumors, though recent studies have confirmed that it is also closely related to a variety of neurological diseases including neurodegenerative disease [Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), etc.] and stroke. This article reviews the definition and characteristics of ferroptosis, the potential mechanisms associated with its development, inducers/inhibitors, and its role in non-neoplastic neurological diseases. We hope to provide a theoretical basis and novel treatment strategies for the treatment of central nervous system diseases by targeting ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Effects of Lactate on One Class of Group III (CT3) Muscle Afferents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00215</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A class of Group III muscle afferent neurons has branching sensory terminals in the connective tissue between layers of mouse abdominal muscles (“CT3 muscle afferents”). These sensory endings are both mechanosensitive and metabosensitive. In the present study, responses of CT3 afferents to lactate ions and changes in temperature were recorded. Raising muscle temperature from 32.7°C to 37°C had no consistent effects on CT3 afferent basal firing rate or responses to either von Frey hair stimulation or to an applied load. Superfusion with lactate ions (15 mM, pH 7.4) was associated with an increase in firing from 6 ± 0.7 Hz to 11.7 ± 6.7 Hz (14 units, n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.05, P = 0.0484) but with considerable variability in the nature and latency of response. Reducing the concentration of extracellular divalent cations, which mimicked the chelating effects of lactate, did not increase firing. Raised concentrations of divalent cations (to compensate for chelation) did not block excitatory effects of lactate on CT3 afferents, suggesting that effects via ASIC3 were not involved. Messenger RNA for the G-protein coupled receptor, hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) was detected in dorsal root ganglia and HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was present in spinal afferent nerve cell bodies retrogradely labeled from mouse abdominal muscles. HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was also present in axons in mouse abdominal muscles. This raises the possibility that some effects of lactate on group III muscle afferents may be mediated by HCAR1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Overview of General and Discriminating Markers of Differential Microglia Phenotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes and microglia activation accompany most of the pathophysiological diseases in the central nervous system. It is proven that glial pathology precedes and even drives the development of multiple neurodegenerative conditions. A growing number of studies point out the importance of microglia in brain development as well as in physiological functioning. These resident brain immune cells are divergent from the peripherally infiltrated macrophages, but their precise in situ discrimination is surprisingly difficult. Microglial heterogeneity in the brain is especially visible in their morphology and cell density in particular brain structures but also in the expression of cellular markers. This often determines their role in physiology or pathology of brain functioning. The species differences between rodent and human markers add complexity to the whole picture. Furthermore, due to activation, microglia show a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from the pro-inflammatory, potentially cytotoxic M1 to the anti-inflammatory, scavenging, and regenerative M2. A precise distinction of specific phenotypes is nowadays essential to study microglial functions and tissue state in such a quickly changing environment. Due to the overwhelming amount of data on multiple sets of markers that is available for such studies, the choice of appropriate markers is a scientific challenge. This review gathers, classifies, and describes known and recently discovered protein markers expressed by microglial cells in their different phenotypes. The presented microglia markers include qualitative and semi-quantitative, general and specific, surface and intracellular proteins, as well as secreted molecules. The information provided here creates a comprehensive and practical guide through the current knowledge and will facilitate the choosing of proper, more specific markers for detailed studies on microglia and neuroinflammatory mechanisms in various physiological as well as pathological conditions. Both basic research and clinical medicine need clearly described and validated molecular markers of microglia phenotype, which are essential in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of diseases engaging glia activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains resident stem cells within specific niches that maintain a self-renewal and proliferative capacity to generate new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes throughout adulthood. Physiological aging is associated with a progressive loss of function and a decline in the self-renewal and regenerative capacities of CNS stem cells. Also, the biggest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is age, and current in vivo and in vitro models of neurodegenerative diseases rarely consider this. Therefore, combining both aging research and appropriate interrogation of animal disease models towards the understanding of the disease and age-related stem cell failure is imperative to the discovery of new therapies. This review article will highlight the main intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of neural stem cell (NSC) aging and discuss how these factors impact normal homeostatic functions within the adult brain. We will consider established in vivo animal and in vitro human disease model systems, and then discuss the current and future trajectories of novel senotherapeutics that target aging NSCs to ameliorate brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Evaluation of the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for Predicting Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment During the Acute Phase in Chinese Minor Stroke Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00236</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00236</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assess the value of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during acute phase in predicting post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) at 3–6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively recruited 229 patients who had suffered their first-ever ischemic stroke. PSCI was determined in 104 of these patients by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery performed at 3–6 months. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was then performed to compare the discriminatory ability of the MMSE and MoCA. Also, we applied a decision tree generated by the classification and regression tree methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total, 66 patients had PSCI when evaluated 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that education, body mass index (BMI), and baseline MoCA scores were independently associated with PSCI. ROC curve analysis showed that the ability to predict PSCI was similar when compared between baseline MoCA scores [area under curve (AUC), 0.821; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.743–0.898] and baseline MMSE scores (AUC, 0.809; 95% CI, 0.725–0.892, P = 0.75). Both MMSE and MoCA exhibited similar predictive values at their optimal cut-off points (MMSE ≤27; sensitivity, 0.682; specificity, 0.816; MoCA ≤21; sensitivity, 0.636; specificity, 0.895). Classification and regression tree-derived analysis yielded an AUC of 0.823 (sensitivity, 0.803; specificity, 0.842).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: When applied within 2 weeks of stroke, the MMSE and MoCA are both useful and have similar predictive value for PSCI 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to investigate whether neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40–50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 protein, neuron‐specific enolase, β‐amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and NPH changes, supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH, with the latter appearing to be rare. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson´s disease are reduced by nabilone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson´s Disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 PD patients with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society‐Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25mg once daily‐1mg twice daily, Phase 1). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for four weeks (Phase 2). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week four. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose=0.75mg) or placebo. At week four, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95%CI 1.53‐3.74, p=0.002, effect size=1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95%CI ‐0.16‐2.16, p=0.280, effect size=0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference:1.63, 95%CI 0.09‐3.18, p=0.030, effect size=0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% placebo‐group, 32% nabilone‐group). There were no serious AEs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for PD patients with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anticoagulation Timing in Cardioembolic Stroke and Recurrent Event Risk</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines recommend initiating anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation, such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high‐risk features on echocardiography.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0–3 days, 4–14 days, or &amp;gt;14 days), and outcomes were recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 2,084 patients, 1,289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the 3 groups (0–3 days: 10.3%, 64/617; 4–14 days: 9.7%, 52/535; &amp;gt;14 days: 10.2%, 14/137; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.933). In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4 and 14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs 0–3 days; odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–4.43), nor did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs &amp;gt;14 days; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.62, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.482).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter real‐world cohort, the recommended (4–14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Non-genomic Actions of Methylprednisolone Differentially Influence GABA and Glutamate Release From Isolated Nerve Terminals of the Rat Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00146</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticosteroids exert a dual role in eukaryotic cells through their action via (1) intracellular receptors (slow genomic responses), or (2) membrane-bound receptors (fast non-genomic responses). Highly vulnerable regions of the brain, like the hippocampus, express high amounts of corticosteroid receptors, yet their actions on ionic currents and neurotransmitters release are still undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on GABA and glutamate (Glu) release from isolated nerve terminals of the rat hippocampus. MP favored both spontaneous and depolarization-evoked [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals, without affecting [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]GABA outflow. Facilitation of [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu release by MP is mediated by a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent non-genomic mechanism relying on the activation of membrane-bound glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors sensitive to their antagonists mifepristone and spironolactone, respectively. The involvement of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent high-affinity EAAT transport reversal was inferred by blockage of MP-induced [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu release by DL-TBOA. Depolarization-evoked [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]GABA release in the presence of MP was partially attenuated by the selective P2X7 receptor antagonist A-438079, but this compound did not affect the release of [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu. Data indicate that MP differentially affects GABA and glutamate release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals via fast non-genomic mechanisms putatively involving the activation of membrane-bound corticosteroid receptors. Facilitation of Glu release strengthen previous assumptions that MP may act as a cognitive enhancer in rats, while crosstalk with ATP-sensitive P2X7 receptors may promote a therapeutically desirable GABAergic inhibitory control during paroxysmal epileptic crisis that might be particularly relevant when extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels decrease below the threshold required for transmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: LAMA2-Related Dystrophies: Clinical Phenotypes, Disease Biomarkers, and Clinical Trial Readiness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LAMA2 gene affect the production of the α2 subunit of laminin-211 (= merosin) and result in either partial or complete laminin-211 deficiency. Complete merosin deficiency is typically associated with a more severe congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), clinically manifested by hypotonia and weakness at birth, the development of contractures of large joints, and progressive respiratory involvement. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness typically prevent independent ambulation. Partial merosin deficiency is mostly manifested by later onset limb-girdle weakness and joint contractures so that independent ambulation is typically achieved. Collectively, complete and partial merosin deficiency is referred to as LAMA2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RDs) and represents one of the most common forms of congenital muscular dystrophies worldwide. LAMA2-RDs are classically characterized by both central and peripheral nervous system involvement with abnormal appearing white matter (WM) on brain MRI and dystrophic appearing muscle on muscle biopsy as well as creatine kinase (CK) levels commonly elevated to &amp;gt;1,000 IU/L. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved diagnostic abilities for LAMA2-RD, and the majority of patients with merosin deficiency carry recessive pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene. The existence of multiple animal models for LAMA2-RDs has helped to advance our understanding of laminin-211 and has been instrumental in preclinical research progress and translation to clinical trials. The first clinical trial for the LAMA2-RDs was a phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety study of the anti-apoptotic compound omigapil, based on preclinical studies performed in the dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt; and dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse models. This phase 1 study enabled the collection of pulmonary and motor outcome measures and also provided the opportunity for investigating exploratory outcome measures including muscle ultrasound, muscle MRI and serum, and urine biomarker collection. Natural history studies, including a five-year prospective natural history and comparative outcome measures study in patients with LAMA2-RD, have helped to better delineate the natural history and identify viable outcome measures. Plans for further clinical trials for LAMA2-RDs are presently in progress, highlighting the necessity of identifying adequate, disease-relevant biomarkers, capable of reflecting potential therapeutic changes, in addition to refining the clinical outcome measures and time-to-event trajectory analysis of affected patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Gut-Brain Axis in the Early Postnatal Years of Life: A Developmental Perspective</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during the early postnatal period can influence brain development and vice-versa. It is increasingly recognized that communication between the GI tract and brain is mainly driven by neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic mediators, collectively called the gut-brain axis (GBA). Changes in the GBA mediators occur in response to the developmental changes in the body during this period. This review provides an overview of major developmental events in the GI tract and brain in the early postnatal period and their parallel developmental trajectories under physiological conditions. Current knowledge of GBA mediators in context to brain function and behavioral outcomes and their synthesis and metabolism (site, timing, etc.) is discussed. This review also presents hypotheses on the role of the GBA mediators in response to the parallel development of the GI tract and brain in infants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Punishment Feedback Impairs Memory and Changes Cortical Feedback-Related Potentials During Motor Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reward and punishment have demonstrated dissociable effects on motor learning and memory, which suggests that these reinforcers are differently processed by the brain. To test this possibility, we use electroencephalography to record cortical neural activity after the presentation of reward and punishment feedback during a visuomotor rotation task. Participants were randomly placed into Reward, Punishment, or Control groups and performed the task under different conditions to assess the adaptation (learning) and retention (memory) of the motor task. These conditions featured an incongruent position between the cursor and the target, with the cursor trajectory, rotated 30° counterclockwise, requiring the participant to adapt their movement to hit the target. Feedback based on error magnitude was provided during the Adaptation condition in the form of a positive number (Reward) or negative number (Punishment), each representing a monetary gain or loss, respectively. No reinforcement or visual feedback was provided during the No Vision condition (retention). Performance error and event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to feedback presentation were calculated for each participant during both conditions. Punishment feedback reduced performance error and promoted faster learning during the Adaptation condition. In contrast, punishment feedback increased performance error during the No Vision condition compared to Control and Reward groups, which suggests a diminished motor memory. Moreover, the Punishment group showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of ERPs during the No Vision condition compared to the Adaptation condition. The amplitude of ERPs did not change in the other two groups. These results suggest that punishment feedback impairs motor retention by altering the neural processing involved in memory encoding. This study provides a neurophysiological underpinning for the dissociative effects of punishment feedback on motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Through Peripheral Nerves Explains Multiple Organ Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19), caused by recently identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by inconsistent clinical presentations. While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Role of Chondroitin Sulfation Following Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury produces long-term neurological damage, and presents a significant public health problem with nearly 18,000 new cases per year in the U.S. The injury results in both acute and chronic changes in the spinal cord, ultimately resulting in the production of a glial scar, consisting of multiple cells including fibroblasts, macrophages, microglia, and reactive astrocytes. Within the scar, there is an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules—primarily tenascins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)—which are considered to be inhibitory to axonal regeneration. In this review article, we discuss the role of CSPGs in the injury response, especially how sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains act to inhibit plasticity and regeneration. This includes how sulfation of GAG chains influences their biological activity and interactions with potential receptors. Comprehending the role of CSPGs in the inhibitory properties of the glial scar provides critical knowledge in the much-needed production of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Fear Priming: A Method for Examining Postural Strategies Associated With Fear of Falling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fear of falling influences postural strategies used for balance, and is key in the maintenance of independent living and quality of life as adults age. However, there is a distinct need for methodology that aims to specifically address and prime fear under dynamic conditions, and to better determine the role of fear in movement preparation. This preliminary study investigated how fear priming influences fear of falling in young and older individuals, and assessed how changes in fear of falling map to movement behavior. Young (21.5 ± 1.7 years, n = 10) and older (58.1 ± 2.2 years) participants matched for height, weight, and sex were repeatedly exposed to four different and incrementally challenging laboratory-based slipping perturbations during a self-initiated, goal-directed step and reach task. Both younger and older cohorts showed similar heightened perceptions in fear of falling after fear priming, and changes in peak joint excursions including reduced ankle flexion, and increased lumbar flexion after fear priming. Age-related changes were only evident in total mediolateral center of mass displacement, with younger participants showing greater displacement after fear priming. Despite clear differences in preparatory muscle onsets relative to reach onset seen in older participants, muscle timings or co-contraction indices were not significantly different. Methods utilizing repeated exposure to varying increases of a slip-based postural challenge can successfully prime fear of falling in individuals, regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Nearly all brain functions involve routing neural activity among a distributed network of areas. Understanding this routing requires more than a description of interareal anatomical connectivity: it requires understanding what controls the flow of signals through interareal circuitry and how this communication might be modulated to allow flexible behavior. Here we review proposals of how communication, particularly between visual cortical areas, is instantiated and modulated, highlighting recent work that offers new perspectives.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Predicting precision grip grasp locations on three-dimensional objects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lina K. Klein, Guido Maiello, Vivian C. Paulun, Roland W. Fleming&lt;/p&gt;

We rarely experience difficulty picking up objects, yet of all potential contact points on the surface, only a small proportion yield effective grasps. Here, we present extensive behavioral data alongside a normative model that correctly predicts human precision grasping of unfamiliar 3D objects. We tracked participants’ forefinger and thumb as they picked up objects of 10 wood and brass cubes configured to tease apart effects of shape, weight, orientation, and mass distribution. Grasps were highly systematic and consistent across repetitions and participants. We employed these data to construct a model which combines five cost functions related to force closure, torque, natural grasp axis, grasp aperture, and visibility. Even without free parameters, the model predicts individual grasps almost as well as different individuals predict one another’s, but fitting weights reveals the relative importance of the different constraints. The model also accurately predicts human grasps on novel 3D-printed objects with more naturalistic geometries and is robust to perturbations in its key parameters. Together, the findings provide a unified account of how we successfully grasp objects of different 3D shape, orientation, mass, and mass distribution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YoLZSjliezU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of regenerative processes in neonatal spinal cord injury in the opossum (Monodelphis domestica): A transcriptomic study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f47a19fd-4fc5-40b4-b6c2-be836b8ff57a/cne24994-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opossums, spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regeneration diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. Analysis of the postinjury transcriptomes suggests that there is a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a stronger influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury, and suggesting that a prolonged immune response may be inhibitory to spinal cord regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (&lt;i&gt;Monodelphis domestica&lt;/i&gt;). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, &lt;i&gt;Padj&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Distribution of polysialic acid (polySia) immunoreactivity in the adult rat brainstem (a) and thoracolumbar spinal cord (b–e). Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the nucleus of solitary tract, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where choline acetyltransferase positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c–e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labeling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in DH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a169b77-30db-4c92-ac85-8e520d6453ea/jnr24708-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal &lt;i&gt;cornu ammonis&lt;/i&gt; (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Impaired intracellular trafficking of sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 contributes to the redox imbalance in Huntington’s disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d254913a-608d-45be-9adb-f4f86586a802/jnr24693-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular ascorbic acid induces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, stimulating sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) anterograde trafficking in wild‐type cells. No ascorbic acid‐induced cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase was observed in Huntington's disease (HD) cells. Thus, SVCT2 would fail to reach the cellular surface, affecting ascorbic acid uptake in HD cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt‐associated protein‐1 mis‐colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid‐induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3222d5e6-4c58-4d3d-8888-58edc6f7d85b/cne24983-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Effects of Cortical Cooling on Activity Across Layers of the Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderate cortical cooling is known to suppress slow oscillations and to evoke persistent cortical activity. However, the cooling-induced changes in electrical activity across cortical layers remain largely unknown. Here, we performed multi-channel local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recordings with linear silicone probes through the layers of single cortical barrel columns in urethane-anesthetized rats under normothermia (38°C) and during local cortical surface cooling (30°C). During cortically generated slow oscillations, moderate cortical cooling decreased delta wave amplitude, delta-wave occurrence, the duration of silent states, and delta wave-locked MUA synchronization. Moderate cortical cooling increased total time spent in the active state and decreased total time spent in the silent state. Cooling-evoked changes in the MUA firing rate in cortical layer 5 (L5) varied from increase to decrease across animals, and the polarity of changes in L5 MUA correlated with changes in total time spent in the active state. The decrease in temperature reduced MUA firing rates in all other cortical layers. Sensory-evoked MUA responses also decreased during cooling through all cortical layers. The cooling-dependent slowdown was detected at the fast time-scale with a decreased frequency of sensory-evoked high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Thus, moderate cortical cooling suppresses slow oscillations and desynchronizes neuronal activity through all cortical layers, and is associated with reduced firing across all cortical layers except L5, where cooling induces variable and non-consistent changes in neuronal firing, which are common features of the transition from slow-wave synchronization to desynchronized activity in the barrel cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Fentanyl Inhibits Air Puff-Evoked Sensory Information Processing in Mouse Cerebellar Neurons Recorded in vivo</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00051</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aim: To examine the effects of fentanyl, a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, on-air puff-evoked responses in Purkinje cells (PCs), and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) using in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male mice 6–8 weeks-old were anesthetized and fixed on a custom-made stereotaxic frame. The cerebellar surface was exposed and perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Patch-clamp recordings in the cell-attached mode were obtained from PCs and MLIs. Facial stimulation by air-puff of the ipsilateral whisker pad was performed through a pressurized injection system. Fentanyl citrate, CTOP, and H-89 dissolved in ACSF were perfused onto the cerebellar surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fentanyl significantly inhibited the amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) of sensory stimulation-evoked inhibitory responses in PCs. Although fentanyl did not influence the frequency of simple spikes (SSs), it decreased the pause of SS. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the fentanyl-induced suppression of the P1 response amplitude was 5.53 μM. The selective MOR antagonist CTOP abolished fentanyl-induced inhibitory responses in PCs. However, the application of CTOP alone increased the amplitude, AUC of P1, and the pause of SS. Notably, fentanyl significantly inhibited the tactile-evoked response of MLIs but did not affect their spontaneous firing. The fentanyl-induced decrease of inhibitory responses in PCs was partially prevented by a PKA inhibitor, H-89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest that fentanyl binds to MORs in MLIs to reduce GABAergic neurotransmission in MLI-PC projections and one potential mechanism is via modulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia, characterized by neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid plaque in brain pathology. Major efforts in AD drug were devoted to the interference with the production and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), by consecutive cleavage by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Therefore, β-secretase and γ-secretase inhibition have been the focus for AD drug discovery efforts for amyloid reduction. Here, we review β-secretase inhibitors and γ-secretase inhibitors/modulators, and their efficacies in clinical trials. In addition, we discussed the novel concept of specifically targeting the γ-secretase substrate APP. Targeting amyloidogenic processing of APP is still a fundamentally sound strategy to develop disease-modifying AD therapies and recent advance in γ-secretase/APP complex structure provides new opportunities in designing selective inhibitors/modulators for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 and Endophilin2 Coordinate Regulation of AMPA Receptor GluA1 Subunit Recycling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which enables the endocytosis, recycling, and exocytosis of AMPARs, is crucial for synaptic plasticity. Endophilin2, which directly interacts with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, plays an important role in AMPAR endocytosis. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) promotes the maturation of the dendritic spine and can transfer AMPARs to the membrane. Although the mechanisms of AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis are well known, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying AMPAR recycling remain unclear. Here, we report a unique interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2. Our results showed that overexpression of CRMP2 and endophilin2 increased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and modestly enhanced AMPAR levels in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the CRMP2 and endophilin2 overexpression phenotype failed to occur when the interaction between these two proteins was inhibited. Further analysis revealed that this interaction was regulated by CRMP2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited its interaction with endophilin2; this was mainly affected by the phosphorylation of Thr514 and Ser518 by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β. CRMP2 phosphorylation increased degradation and inhibited the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the dephosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited degradation and promoted the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2 was conductive to the recycling of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits in hippocampal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Assessing the Effects of Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation Over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Human Cognition: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00035</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta–gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Abnormal Spontaneous Neural Activity in Parkinson’s Disease With “pure” Apathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00830</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00830</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Apathy is one of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, its pathophysiology remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired at a 3.0T MRI scanner using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) metric in 20 de novo, drug-naïve, non-demented PD patients with apathy (PD-A), 26 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA) without comorbidity of depressive or anxious symptoms, and 23 matched healthy control (HC) subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that the ALFF decreased significantly in the bilateral nucleus accumbens, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with PD-A compared to patients with PD-NA and HC subjects. Furthermore, apathy severity was negatively correlated with the ALFF in the bilateral nucleus accumbens and dorsal ACC in the pooled patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study characterized the functional pattern of changes in spontaneous neural activity in patients with PD-A. With the aim to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these changes, this study controlled for the potentially confounding effects of dopaminergic medication, depression, anxiety, and global cognitive impairment. The findings of the current study add to the literature by highlighting potential abnormalities in mesocorticolimbic pathways involved in the development of apathy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: TRP Channels Role in Pain Associated With Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00782</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00782</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transient receptor potential (TRP) are cation channels expressed in both non-excitable and excitable cells from diverse tissues, including heart, lung, and brain. The TRP channel family includes 28 isoforms activated by physical and chemical stimuli, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, and noxious stimuli. Recently, it has been shown that TRP channels are also directly or indirectly activated by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and TRP channels are involved in the progression of those diseases by mechanisms involving changes in the crosstalk between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation, oxidative stress, and production of inflammatory mediators. TRP channels involved in nociception include members of the TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPC subfamilies that transduce physical and chemical noxious stimuli. It has also been reported that pain is a complex issue in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and adequate management of pain in those conditions is still in discussion. TRPV1 has a role in neuroinflammation, a critical mechanism involved in neurodegeneration. Therefore, some studies have considered TRPV1 as a target for both pain treatment and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, this review aimed to describe the TRP-dependent mechanism that can mediate pain sensation in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic approach available to palliate pain and neurodegenerative symptoms throughout the regulation of these channels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MR Imaging of SCA3/MJD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00749</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00749</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a progressive autosomal dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia characterized by the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded protein within neuronal nuclei in the brain, which can lead to brain damage that precedes the onset of clinical manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as morphometric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have gained increasing attention as non-invasive and quantitative methods for the assessment of structural and functional alterations in clinical SCA3/MJD patients as well as preclinical carriers. Morphometric MRI has demonstrated typical patterns of atrophy or volume loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with extensive lesions in some supratentorial areas. DTI has detected widespread microstructural alterations in brain white matter, which indicate disrupted brain anatomical connectivity. Task-related fMRI has presented unusual brain activation patterns within the cerebellum and some extracerebellar tissue, reflecting the decreased functional connectivity of these brain regions in SCA3/MJD subjects. MRS has revealed abnormal neurochemical profiles, such as the levels or ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine, in both clinical cases and preclinical cases before the alterations in brain anatomical structure. Moreover, a number of studies have reported correlations of MR imaging alterations with clinical and genetic features. The utility of these MR imaging techniques can help to identify preclinical SCA3/MJD carriers, monitor disease progression, evaluate response to therapeutic interventions, and illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and prognosis of SCA3/MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Self-Selection of Interesting Occupation Facilitates Cognitive Response to the Task: An Event-Related Potential Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00299</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00299</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: In this study, we examined whether the self-selection of occupations of interest affects reaction times (RTs) and cognitive processing by using the Aid for Decision-making in Occupation Choice (ADOC) and event-related potentials (ERP). We also assessed the relationship of these with psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We extracted 78 occupations from the ADOC in consideration of the subjects’ age, and three conditions were set: (1) self-selection of an interesting occupation; (2) self-selection of a disliked occupation; and (3) forced selection. The RT task was executed under their conditions during which ERP was measured. We compared the P300 component of ERP in these conditions. Moreover, we examined the association of cognitive processing and degree of satisfaction and performance concerning occupation, with psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: P300 amplitude at Fz significantly increased in the self-selection of an interesting occupation. P300 amplitude at Pz was significantly positively correlated with the occupational satisfaction score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Self-selection of interesting occupations in the ADOC resulted in increased attention resource allocation by increasing motivation. Further, there was a positive correlation between satisfaction concerning the occupation and attention of resource allocation. Therefore, occupational therapists should know which occupations the patients consider interesting and help them to select by themselves, thus enhancing their satisfaction after consultation. These interventions may contribute to promoting motivation and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Adolescent Substance Use and the Brain: Behavioral, Cognitive and Neuroimaging Correlates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is an important ontogenetic period that is characterized by behaviors such as enhanced novelty-seeking, impulsivity, and reward preference, which can give rise to an increased risk for substance use. While substance use rates in adolescence are generally on a decline, the current rates combined with emerging trends, such as increases in e-cigarette use, remain a significant public health concern. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological divergences associated with adolescent substance use, derived from a cross-sectional, retrospective, and longitudinal studies, and highlight how the use of these substances during adolescence may relate to behavioral and neuroimaging-based outcomes. Identifying and understanding the associations between adolescent substance use and changes in cognition, mental health, and future substance use risk may assist our understanding of the consequences of drug exposure during this critical window.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Being in the Past and Perform the Future in a Virtual World: VR Applications to Assess and Enhance Episodic and Prospective Memory in Normal and Pathological Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00297</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The process of aging commonly features a gradual deterioration in cognitive performance and, in particular, the decline of memory. Despite the increased longevity of the world’s population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, continues to be a major burden on public health, and consequently, the latest research has been focused on memory and aging. Currently, the failure of episodic and Prospective memory (PM) is one of the main complaints in the elderly, considered among the early symptoms of dementia. It is therefore increasingly important to define more clearly the boundaries between normal and pathological aging. Recently, researchers have begun to build and apply Virtual Environments (VE) to the explicit purpose of better understanding the performance of episodic and PM in complex and realistic contexts, with the perspective of further developing effective training procedures that depend on reliable cognitive assessment methods. Virtual technology offers higher levels of realism than “pen and paper” testing and at the same time more experimental control than naturalistic settings. In this mini-review article, we examine the outcomes of recently available studies on virtual reality technology applications developed for the assessment and improvement of episodic and/or PM. To consider the latest technology, we selected 29 articles that have been published in the last 10 years. These documents show that VR-based technologies can provide a valid basis for screening and treatment and, through increased sensory stimulation and enriched environments reproducing the scenarios of everyday life, could represent effective stimulating experiences even in pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Admittance Method for Estimating Local Field Potentials Generated in a Multi-Scale Neuron Model of the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Significant progress has been made toward model-based prediction of neral tissue activation in response to extracellular electrical stimulation, but challenges remain in the accurate and efficient estimation of distributed local field potentials (LFP). Analytical methods of estimating electric fields are a first-order approximation that may be suitable for model validation, but they are computationally expensive and cannot accurately capture boundary conditions in heterogeneous tissue. While there are many appropriate numerical methods of solving electric fields in neural tissue models, there isn't an established standard for mesh geometry nor a well-known rule for handling any mismatch in spatial resolution. Moreover, the challenge of misalignment between current sources and mesh nodes in a finite-element or resistor-network method volume conduction model needs to be further investigated. Therefore, using a previously published and validated multi-scale model of the hippocampus, the authors have formulated an algorithm for LFP estimation, and by extension, bidirectional communication between discretized and numerically solved volume conduction models and biologically detailed neural circuit models constructed in NEURON. Development of this algorithm required that we assess meshes of (i) unstructured tetrahedral and grid-based hexahedral geometries as well as (ii) differing approaches for managing the spatial misalignment of current sources and mesh nodes. The resulting algorithm is validated through the comparison of Admittance Method predicted evoked potentials with analytically estimated LFPs. Establishing this method is a critical step toward closed-loop integration of volume conductor and NEURON models that could lead to substantial improvement of the predictive power of multi-scale stimulation models of cortical tissue. These models may be used to deepen our understanding of hippocampal pathologies and the identification of efficacious electroceutical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Overall Survival Prediction in Glioblastoma With Radiomic Features Using Machine Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00061</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is a WHO grade IV brain tumor, which leads to poor overall survival (OS) of patients. For precise surgical and treatment planning, OS prediction of glioblastoma (GBM) patients is highly desired by clinicians and oncologists. Radiomic research attempts at predicting disease prognosis, thus providing beneficial information for personalized treatment from a variety of imaging features extracted from multiple MR images. In this study, first-order, intensity-based volume and shape-based and textural radiomic features are extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1ce MRI data. The region of interest is further decomposed with stationary wavelet transform with low-pass and high-pass filtering. Further, radiomic features are extracted on these decomposed images, which helped in acquiring the directional information. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach achieved 0.695, 0.571, and 0.558 on BraTS training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach secured the third position in BraTS 2018 challenge for the OS prediction task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Maternal Immune Activation Affects Hippocampal Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission in Offspring From an Early Developmental Period to Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the risk factors for schizophrenia is maternal infection. We have previously shown that Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) induced maternal immune activation in mice caused histological changes in the hippocampal CA1 area of offspring during the developmental period and impaired sensorimotor gating in offspring during adulthood, resulting in behavioral changes. However, it remains unclear how maternal immune activation functionally impacts the hippocampal neuronal activity of offspring. We studied the effect of prenatal poly I:C treatment on synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in postnatal and adult offspring. Treatment with poly I:C diminished excitatory and enhanced inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic transmission on pyramidal cells in adult offspring. During the early developmental period, we still observed that treatment with poly I:C decreased excitatory synaptic transmission and potentially increased GABAergic synaptic transmission, which was uncovered under a condition of high extracellular potassium-activated neurons. In conclusion, we demonstrate that maternal immune activation decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission on hippocampal pyramidal cells from an early developmental period to adulthood, which could result in net inhibition in conjunction with poor functional organization and integration of hippocampal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, post-mortem analysis of human brain pathologies has been purely descriptive, limiting insight into the pathological mechanisms. However, starting in the early 2000s, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the routine application of bulk RNA-sequencing and microarray technologies have revolutionized the usefulness of post-mortem human brain tissue. This has allowed many studies to provide novel mechanistic insights into certain brain pathologies, albeit at a still unsatisfying resolution, with masking of lowly expressed genes and regulatory elements in different cell types. The recent rapid evolution of single-cell technologies has now allowed researchers to shed light on human pathologies at a previously unreached resolution revealing further insights into pathological mechanisms that will open the way for the development of new strategies for therapies. In this review article, we will give an overview of the incremental information that single-cell technologies have given us for human white matter (WM) pathologies, summarize which single-cell technologies are available, and speculate where these novel approaches may lead us for pathological assessment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: FGF5 Regulates Schwann Cell Migration and Adhesion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family polypeptides play key roles in promoting tissue regeneration and repair. FGF5 is strongly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system following injury; however, a role for FGF5 in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been shown up to now. In this report, we examined the expression of FGF5 and its receptors FGFR1-4 in Schwann cells of the mouse sciatic nerve following injury, and then measured the effects of FGF5 treatment upon cultured primary rat Schwann cells. By microarray and mRNA sequencing data analysis, RT-PCR, qPCR, western blotting and immunostaining, we show that FGF5 is highly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the mouse distal sciatic nerve following injury, and FGFR1 and FGFR2 are highly expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve both before and following injury. Using cultured primary rat Schwann cells, we show that FGF5 inhibits ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity but promotes rapid Schwann cell migration and adhesion via the upregulation of N-cadherin. Thus, FGF5 is an autocrine regulator of Schwann cells to regulate Schwann cell migration and adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Streptozotocin Induces Alzheimer’s Disease-Like Pathology in Hippocampal Neuronal Cells via CDK5/Drp1-Mediated Mitochondrial Fragmentation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant brain insulin signaling plays a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the progression of AD, with excessive mitochondrial fission in the hippocampus being one of the pathological mechanisms of AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of AD and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by aberrant brain insulin signaling in the hippocampal neurons are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanistic signaling associated with mitochondrial dynamics using streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound, in the hippocampus cell line, HT-22 cells. In this metabolic dysfunctional cellular model, hallmarks of AD such as neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and tau hyper-phosphorylation are induced by STZ. We found that in the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, phosphorylation is increased in STZ-treated HT-22 cells. We also determined that inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation suppresses STZ-induced AD-like pathology. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of Drp1 was induced by CDK5, and inhibition of CDK5 suppresses STZ-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and AD-like pathology. Therefore, these findings indicate that mitochondrial morphology and functional regulation may be a strategy of potential therapeutic for treating abnormal metabolic functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
